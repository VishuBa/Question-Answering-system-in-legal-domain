The prosecution story showed that the offence of extortion
committed on a particular day was one of a series of acts
connected with the offence of murder and attempt to murder
committed on their previous day in such a way as to form one
transaction.

The incidents related in the evidence left no doubt that
from the moment the accused (a Reserve Inspector of Police)
Started from the Police State, he committed a series of acts
involving killing, injuring people, unlawfully confining
others and extorting money from one of them and_ therefore
the series of acts attributed to him constituted one
transaction in the course of which two offences which were
alleged to be distinct were committed.

Held, that under the circumstances the case fell within the
purview of section 235 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and

Such joinder was permitted by the exception enacted in that
section.

Where the two Judges of the High Court on appeal are
divided in their opinion as to the guilt of the accused and
the third Judge to whom reference is made agrees with one of
them who is upholding the conviction and sentence, it is
desirable as a matter of convention though not as a_ matter
of strict law that ordinarily the extreme penalty should not
be imposed.

JUDGMENT :

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 82 of 1953.

Appeal under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Order dated the
16th August, 1953, of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in Criminal Appeal No. 1557/6 of
1950, arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 16th October, 1950, of the Court of Special
Judge, Warangal, in Case No. 28/2 of 1950.

A. A. Peerbhoy, J. B. Dadachanji and Rajinder Narain for the appellant.
Porus A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale for the respondent.

1954. May 6. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GHULAM HASAN J.-The appellant was
tried and convicted by the Special Judge, Warangal, for various offences under the Hyderabad Penal
Code. These correspond to sections 302, 307, 347 and 384 of the Indian Penal Code, the sentences
awarded under the first two sections respectively being death and life imprisonment, and separate
sentences 'of two years' rigorous imprisonment under the latter two. The. two learned Judges of the
High Court, who heard the appeal, differed, Manohar Pershad J. upholding the convictions, and the
sentences and M. S. Ali Khan J. acquitting the appellant. The third learned Judge, A. Srinivasachari
J., on reference which was Occasioned by the difference of opinion agreed with Manohar Pershad J.
Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the two agreeing Judges. The occurrence which led to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1576995/ 2Aftab Ahmad Khan vs The State Of Hyderabad on 6 May, 1954

the prosecution of the appellant took place on September 13,1948, which was the beginning of the
first day of Police action in Hyderabad. The appellant, who was Reserve Inspector of Police
stationed at Mahbubabad at the material time, according to the prosecution story, visited two
villages Rajole and Korivi accompanied by a number of Razakars and the Police. He arrested Janaki
Ramiah (P.W. 5) and Nerella Ramulu (P.W. 9) at Rajole and took them to Korivi. Outside this village
in the waste land he spotted four men going to their fields and shot at them with his gun. The
deceased Mura Muthiah and Somanaboyanna Muthandu (P.W. 2) were injured in the knee, while
the other two Kotta Ramiah (P.W. 3) and Kancham Latchiah (P.W. 4) were uninjured. The latter two
hid themselves behind the babul trees. P.W. 2 also ran away and hid himself in the bajra fields a few
yards away but the deceased remained where he fell. The appellant searched for the three persons
who had run away. He caught P.W. 3 and P.W. 4 and brought them to the spot where the deceased
was lying but he could not trace P.W. 2. The appellant seeing that Mora Muthiah was not dead, shot
him in the chest and killed him. The whole party consisting of P.W. 3, P.W. 4, P.W. 5 and P.W. 9
then went to Korivi village. The appellant stayed at the house of one Maikaldari in the village and
spent the night there. Maikaldari and one Berda Agiah (P.W. 8) both asked the appellant why he had
arrested P.W. 3 and P.W. 4, for they were not Congress men. Upon this the appellant released them.
The prosecution story proceeds that the father (P.W.

1) of the deceased saw the appellant in the night of the 13th September and asked him why he had
killed his son. The appellant without saying more advised him to cremate the dead body. P.W. I
borrowed wood from the people and cremated the body. Four months later the appellant went and
stayed at the Government bungalow Korivi, -sent for P.W. I and offered him Rs. 200/- as
hush-money for not disclosing the offence. The offer was refused. P.W. 3 and P.W. 4 who had been
released told the father of P.W. 2 next morning that his son was lying injured in the bajra field. He
went and had P.W. 2 removed to the hospital where his injuries were attended to. On the same
morning the appellant, who had detained P.W. 5 and P.W. 9 in custody, asked them to pay Rs. 200/when they would be released. P.W. 5 went with a constable to the house of P.W. 6 and P.W. 7 and
borrowed Rs. 100/- from each of them. On this being paid he was released. P.W. 9 was unable to pay
any money and he was let off.

The defence was a denial of the offence. The appellant denied having zone to the village in question
or having committed any of the offences attributed to him. He stated that he was posted at
Mahbubabad in order to stop the subversive activities of the communists and that the witnesses
being communists had falsely implicated him. He produced witnesses in defence.

The First Information Report was lodged on April 14,1949. This delay was due to the disturbed
conditions prevailing at the time and does not affect the truth of the story. The appellant was
prosecuted and the charge sheet submitted against him on October 30, 1949. The charge was framed
by a Munsiff Magistrate who committed the appellant to the Sessions. As already ,stated, the learned
Special Judge convicted and sentenced the appellant and his convictions and sentences were upheld
by a majority of two Judges.

It has been argued by Mr. Peerbhoy, learned counsel on behalf of the appellant, that his client had
no fair trial and has detailed a number of circumstances as supporting his contention. We think it

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1576995/ 3Aftab Ahmad Khan vs The State Of Hyderabad on 6 May, 1954

unnecessary to deal with each and every one of these circumstances as in our opinion they do not
affect the substance of the matter and are too trifling to justify the conclusion that the appellant
suffered any prejudice or that any miscarriage of justice had resulted. We shall confine ourselves
only to a few of them which need examination. It was complained that the appellant was not
furnished with copies of the statements of prosecution Witnesses recorded by the Police and this
hampered the appellant in cross-examining the witnesses with reference to their previous
statements. It appears that the appellant filed an application through counsel on August 28, 1950,
asking for copies of such statements under section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The
corresponding section of the Hyderabad Penal Code is 166 which is not the same as section 162.
While under section 162 it is the duty of the Court to direct a copy of the statement of a witness
recorded by the Police in the course of investigation to be furnished to the accused with a view to
enable him to cross- examine such a witness with reference to his previous statement, no such duty
is imposed by section 166 and the matter is left entirely to the discretion of the Court. This
application was made for re-cross-examination of witnesses which obviously refers to the last stage
of the prosecution evidence. The order passed on the application as translated is unintelligible and
does not convey the real intention of the Court. The original which was shown to us, however, leaves
no doubt whatever that the Court ordered that the case diaries and the statements were in Court and
the appellant's counsel could look into them with a view to help him in the re-cross-examination of
the witnesses but if the Court later felt the necessity of furnishing copies, the matter would be
considered. No complaint was made before the Special Judge about any prejudice having been
caused to the appellant by this order, nor was this point taken before the High Court. Had the
appellant any legitimate ground for grievance on this score, he would no doubt have raised it before
the High Court. We think, therefore, that there is no substance in this point.

It was also contended that the prosecution should have produced the duty register of the appellant
who was- a Government servant in order to put the matter beyond doubt whether,the accused had
left the Headquarters on the crucial date. We do -.lot think that it was any part of the duty of the
prosecution to produce such evidence, particularly in view of the fact that direct evidence of the
offence was produced in the case. It appears, however, that the appellant himself summoned the
Sub-Inspector of Police with the attendance register for 1358 Fasli, corresponding to October, 1948.
The Deputy Superintendent of Police in his letter had stated that the entries for October were made
in the register for 1357 Fasli and that register was destroyed during the Police action. The appellant's
counsel inspected the register and on noticing that the entry for October did not find a place therein
and had been made in the previous register for 1357 Fasli, which was destroyed during the Police
action, he withdrew the witness. The appellant satisfied himself from the inspection of this register
that the desired entries were not to be found. Since the register containing the material entries was
destroyed, it was impossible for the prosecution to discharge the alleged burden of proving the
entries in the duty register on the material date.

It was also faintly contended that there was no evidence to show that Mura Muthiah had actually
died. The father of the deceased gave evidence that the dead body of his son was cremated by him
and in this he was supported by other witnesses. There is no force in this point. Upon the whole we
are satisfied that the appellant has not been able to substantiate his contention that he did not have
a fair trial.

The next contention advanced by the appellant's learned counsel is that there was a misjoinder of
charges, -that though the charges of murder and attempt to murder could be joined and tried
together, the charges of extortion and wrongful confinement were distinct offences for which the
appellant should have been charged and tried separately as required by the mandatory provisions of
section 233 of the Code. The first two offences took place on September 13, 1948, in the night, while
the act of extortion took place next morning on the 14th and the latter charge had nothing whatever
to do with the offences committed on the previous night. Learned counsel contends that where, as
here, there is disobedience to an express provision as to the mode of trial contained in section 233,
the trial is wholly vitiated and the accused is not bound to show that the misjoinder has caused any
prejudice to him. The contention is based on the case of Subramania Ayyar v. King-Emperor(1)
showing that the misjoinder of distinct offences being prohibited by the express provision of the
Code renders the trial illegal and does not amount to a mere irregularity curable by section 537. This
was a case in which the accused was charged with 41 acts extending over a period of two years which
was plainly against the provisions of section 234 which permitted trial only for three offences of the
same kind if committed within a period of twelve months. The decision of Lord Halsbury, Lord
Chancellor, in this case was distinguished in the case of Abdul Rahman v. The King-Emperor (1) by
the Privy Council. That was a case of conviction on a charge of abetment of forgery in which the
depositions of some witnesses were not read over to the witnesses but were handed over to them to
read themselves. It was held that though the course pursued was in violation of the provisions of
section 360, it was a mere irregularity within section 537 and that as no failure of justice had been
occasioned, the trial was not vitiated. Both the above cases were referred to by the Privy Council in
Babulal Chaukani v. King-Emperor(1).. The question in that case arose as to the true effect of section
239(d), which provides that persons who are (1) 28 I.A. 257.

(2) 541.A. 96, (3) A.I.R. 1938 P.C. 130, accused of different offences committed in the course of the
same transaction may be charged and tried together. The question was whether the correctness of
the joinder which depends on the sameness of the transaction is to be determined by looking at the
accusation or by looking at the result of the trial. It was held that the relevant point of time is the
time of accusation and not that of the eventual result. The charges in this case were conspiracy to
steal electricity and theft of electricity both under the Electricity Act and under the Penal Code. The
Privy Council referred to the fact that the parties had treated an infringement of section 239(d) as an
illegality vitiating the trial under the rule stated in Subramania Ayyar v. King Emperor(1) as
contrasted with the result of irregularity as held in Abdul Rahman v. The King,, Emperor (2) . The
Privy Council merely assumed it to be so without thinking it necessary to discuss the precise scope of
the decision in Subramania's case, because in their view the question did not arise. Again in
Pulukuri Kottaya and Others v. Emperor (3) the Privy Council treated a breach of the provisions of
section 162 of the Code as a mere irregularity curable under section 537 and as no prejudice was
caused in the particular circumstances of that case, the trial was held valid. Reference was made to
Subramania Ayyar v. King-Emperor(1) as one dealing with the mode of trial in which no question of
curing any irregularity arises but if there is some error or irregularity in the conduct of the trial, even
though it may amount to a breach of one or more of the provisions of the Code, it was a mere
irregularity and in support of this reference was made to Abdul Rahman v. The King-Emperor(1).
Several decisions of the High Courts were referred to in course of the arguments with a view to
showing what is the true state of the law in view of the Privy Council decisions referred to above but

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1576995/ 5Aftab Ahmad Khan vs The State Of Hyderabad on 6 May, 1954

we do not think that that question arises in the present case. We are of opinion that the present is
not a case under section 233 of the Code and it is, therefore, unnecessary to consider whether the
violation of its provisions amounts to an illegality vitiating the trial altogether (1) 28 I.A. 257.

(2) 54 1.A. 96.
(3) A.I.R. 1947 P.C. 67.

or it is a mere irregularity which can be condoned under section 537. Section 233 embodies the
general law as to the joinder of charges and lays down a rule that for every distinct offence there
should be a separate charge and every: such charge should be tried separately. There is no doubt
that the object of section 233 is to save the accused from being embarrassed in his defence if distinct
offences are lumped together in one charge or in separate charges and are tried together but the
Legislature has engrafted certain exceptions upon this rule contained in sections 234, 235, 236 and
239. Having regard to the facts and the circumstances of this case, we are of opinion that the present
case falls under section 235. It provides that if in one series of acts so connected together as to form
the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged
with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence. The prosecution story as disclosed in the evidence
clearly shows that the offence of extortion committed on the 14th September was one of a series of
acts connected with the offence of murder and attempt to murder committed on the previous day in
such a way as to form the same transaction. The prosecution case was that when the appellant
accompanied by his party came, he caught hold of two persons (P.W. 5 and P.W. 9) at Rajole and
proceeded to Korivi. He took them into custody without any rhyme or reason. Then outside the
village seeing the deceased, P.W. 2, P.W. 3 and P. W. 4 he shot at them. The deceased fell down
while the others ran away. He pursued them and brought two of them back to the spot where the
deceased was lying but was yet alive. He shot him in the chest and killed him. Then he proceeded to
the village itself where he stayed for the night. He released P. W. 3 and P. W. 4 on the intercession of
certain persons but kept P. W. 5 and P. W. 9 in wrongful confinement and released them only next
morning after extorting Rs. 200 from P. W. 5. These incidents related in the evidence leave no
manner of doubt that from the moment the appellant started from the Police Station, he committed
a series of acts involving killing, injuring people, unlawfully confining others and extorting money
from one of them. We are satisfied that the series of acts attributed to the appellant constitute one
transaction in which the two offences which are alleged to be distinct were committed. The case falls
squarely within the purview of section 235 of the Code and we are, therefore, of opinion that such
misjoinder was permitted by the exception. No question of contravention of any express provision of
the Code such as section 233 arises and in the circumstances it is not necessary for us to consider
how far the violation of any express provisions of the Code relating to the mode of a trial or
otherwise constitutes an illegality which vitiates the trial as distinguished. from an irregularity
which is curable under section 537. This conclusion in our opinion disposes of the contention about
misjoinder of the charges. The fact that the offence of extortion was committed at a different place
and at a different time does not any the less make the act as one committed in the course of the same
transaction. Turning to the merits of the matter, we are not satisfied that any prejudice was caused
to the appellant in fact. It is not possible to say that the Court being influenced by the evidence on
the question of extortion was easily led into the error of believing the evidence on the question of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1576995/ 6Aftab Ahmad Khan vs The State Of Hyderabad on 6 May, 1954

murder. The witnesses on the point of extortion are P.W. 5 and P.W. 9. These are the two persons
who were taken away from village Rajole and were wrongfully confined, P.W. 5 being released on
payment of Rs. 200 and the other let off without payment. These two witnesses are also witnesses to
the fact of murder, in addition to the other three witnesses, P.W. 2, P.W. 3 and P.W. 4. P.W. 5 was
injured by the gun-shot but survived. The other two were scared on hearing the gun-shot and ran
away taking protection under the babul tree. It is not possible to contend that the Sessions Judge
having believed the evidence of extortion from P.W. 5 must have been persuaded into believing that
the story of murder deposed to by him must be correct, for there is not only the evidence of P. W. 5,
but three other inde- pendent witnesses.

Lastly it was contended that the judgment of one of the agreeing Judges Manohar Pershad J. is
purely mechanical and does not show that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case. No such
complaint is made about the judgment of the other agreeing Judge Srinivasachari J. It is true that
the learned Judge has made copious quotations verbatim from the evidence of the witnesses and his
comment upon the evidence is not as full and detailed as might be expected but this practice of
writing judgments in this way seems fairly general in Hyderabad though we cannot help saying that
it is not to be commended. It is the obvious duty of the Court to give a summary of the evidence of
material witnesses and to appraise the evidence with a view to arriving at the conclusion whether
the testimony of the witness should-be believed. We do not think, however, that the criticism that
the judgment is mechanical and does not show a proper appreciation of the evidence is
well-founded. The prosecution evidence was believed by the trial Judge and the defence evidence to
the effect that the deceased was killed by the Military and that the appellant was not present at the
time of the occurrence was disbelieved. This finding was accepted by both the learned agreeing
-Judges. This Court cannot interfere with the finding arrived at, on an appreciation of the evidence.
We are satisfied that there is no good ground for disturbing the conviction of the appellant.

The only question which remains for consideration is whether the sentence of death is the
appropriate sentence in the present case. No doubt there are no special circumstances which justify
the imposition of any other but the normal sentence for the offence of murder. We think, however,
that where the two Judges of the High Court on appeal are divided in their opinion as to the guilt of
the accused and the third Judge to whom reference is made agrees with one of them who is
upholding the conviction and sentence, it seems to us desirable as a matter of convention though
snot as a matter of strict law that ordinarily the extreme penalty should not be imposed. We
accordingly, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant, reduce his sentence to one of
transportation for life. In other respects the appeal stands dismissed. All the sentences will run
concurrently.

was lying but he could not trace P.W. 2. The appellant seeing that Mora Muthiah was not dead, shot
him in the chest and killed him. The whole party consisting of P.W. 3, P.W. 4, P.W. 5 and P.W. 9
then went to Korivi village. The appellant stayed at the house of one Maikaldari in the village and
spent the night there. Maikaldari and one Berda Agiah (P.W. 8) both asked the appellant why he had
arrested P.W. 3 and P.W. 4, for they were not Congress men. Upon this the appellant released them.
The prosecution story proceeds that the father (P.W.

1) of the deceased saw the appellant in the night of the 13th September and asked him why he had
killed his son. The appellant without saying more advised him to cremate the dead body. P.W. I
borrowed wood from the people and cremated the body. Four months later the appellant went and
stayed at the Government bungalow Korivi, -sent for P.W. I and offered him Rs. 200/- as
hush-money for not disclosing the offence. The offer was refused. P.W. 3 and P.W. 4 who had been
released told the father of P.W. 2 next morning that his son was lying injured in the bajra field. He
went and had P.W. 2 removed to the hospital where his injuries were attended to. On the same
morning the appellant, who had detained P.W. 5 and P.W. 9 in custody, asked them to pay Rs. 200/when they would be released. P.W. 5 went with a constable to the house of P.W. 6 and P.W. 7 and
borrowed Rs. 100/- from each of them. On this being paid he was released. P.W. 9 was unable to pay
any money and he was let off.

The defence was a denial of the offence. The appellant denied having zone to the village in question
or having committed any of the offences attributed to him. He stated that he was posted at
Mahbubabad in order to stop the subversive activities of the communists and that the witnesses
being communists had falsely implicated him. He produced witnesses in defence.

The First Information Report was lodged on April 14,1949. This delay was due to the disturbed
conditions prevailing at the time and does not affect the truth of the story. The appellant was
prosecuted and the charge sheet submitted against him on October 30, 1949. The charge was framed
by a Munsiff Magistrate who committed the appellant to the Sessions. As already ,stated, the learned
Special Judge convicted and sentenced the appellant and his convictions and sentences were upheld
by a majority of two Judges.

It has been argued by Mr. Peerbhoy, learned counsel on behalf of the appellant, that his client had
no fair trial and has detailed a number of circumstances as supporting his contention. We think it

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1576995/ 3Aftab Ahmad Khan vs The State Of Hyderabad on 6 May, 1954

unnecessary to deal with each and every one of these circumstances as in our opinion they do not
affect the substance of the matter and are too trifling to justify the conclusion that the appellant
suffered any prejudice or that any miscarriage of justice had resulted. We shall confine ourselves
only to a few of them which need examination. It was complained that the appellant was not
furnished with copies of the statements of prosecution Witnesses recorded by the Police and this
hampered the appellant in cross-examining the witnesses with reference to their previous
statements. It appears that the appellant filed an application through counsel on August 28, 1950,
asking for copies of such statements under section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The
corresponding section of the Hyderabad Penal Code is 166 which is not the same as section 162.
While under section 162 it is the duty of the Court to direct a copy of the statement of a witness
recorded by the Police in the course of investigation to be furnished to the accused with a view to
enable him to cross- examine such a witness with reference to his previous statement, no such duty
is imposed by section 166 and the matter is left entirely to the discretion of the Court. This
application was made for re-cross-examination of witnesses which obviously refers to the last stage
of the prosecution evidence. The order passed on the application as translated is unintelligible and
does not convey the real intention of the Court. The original which was shown to us, however, leaves
no doubt whatever that the Court ordered that the case diaries and the statements were in Court and
the appellant's counsel could look into them with a view to help him in the re-cross-examination of
the witnesses but if the Court later felt the necessity of furnishing copies, the matter would be
considered. No complaint was made before the Special Judge about any prejudice having been
caused to the appellant by this order, nor was this point taken before the High Court. Had the
appellant any legitimate ground for grievance on this score, he would no doubt have raised it before
the High Court. We think, therefore, that there is no substance in this point.

It was also contended that the prosecution should have produced the duty register of the appellant
who was- a Government servant in order to put the matter beyond doubt whether,the accused had
left the Headquarters on the crucial date. We do -.lot think that it was any part of the duty of the
prosecution to produce such evidence, particularly in view of the fact that direct evidence of the
offence was produced in the case. It appears, however, that the appellant himself summoned the
Sub-Inspector of Police with the attendance register for 1358 Fasli, corresponding to October, 1948.
The Deputy Superintendent of Police in his letter had stated that the entries for October were made
in the register for 1357 Fasli and that register was destroyed during the Police action. The appellant's
counsel inspected the register and on noticing that the entry for October did not find a place therein
and had been made in the previous register for 1357 Fasli, which was destroyed during the Police
action, he withdrew the witness. The appellant satisfied himself from the inspection of this register
that the desired entries were not to be found. Since the register containing the material entries was
destroyed, it was impossible for the prosecution to discharge the alleged burden of proving the
entries in the duty register on the material date.

It was also faintly contended that there was no evidence to show that Mura Muthiah had actually
died. The father of the deceased gave evidence that the dead body of his son was cremated by him
and in this he was supported by other witnesses. There is no force in this point. Upon the whole we
are satisfied that the appellant has not been able to substantiate his contention that he did not have
a fair trial.

The next contention advanced by the appellant's learned counsel is that there was a misjoinder of
charges, -that though the charges of murder and attempt to murder could be joined and tried
together, the charges of extortion and wrongful confinement were distinct offences for which the
appellant should have been charged and tried separately as required by the mandatory provisions of
section 233 of the Code. The first two offences took place on September 13, 1948, in the night, while
the act of extortion took place next morning on the 14th and the latter charge had nothing whatever
to do with the offences committed on the previous night. Learned counsel contends that where, as
here, there is disobedience to an express provision as to the mode of trial contained in section 233,
the trial is wholly vitiated and the accused is not bound to show that the misjoinder has caused any
prejudice to him. The contention is based on the case of Subramania Ayyar v. King-Emperor(1)
showing that the misjoinder of distinct offences being prohibited by the express provision of the
Code renders the trial illegal and does not amount to a mere irregularity curable by section 537. This
was a case in which the accused was charged with 41 acts extending over a period of two years which
was plainly against the provisions of section 234 which permitted trial only for three offences of the
same kind if committed within a period of twelve months. The decision of Lord Halsbury, Lord
Chancellor, in this case was distinguished in the case of Abdul Rahman v. The King-Emperor (1) by
the Privy Council. That was a case of conviction on a charge of abetment of forgery in which the
depositions of some witnesses were not read over to the witnesses but were handed over to them to
read themselves. It was held that though the course pursued was in violation of the provisions of
section 360, it was a mere irregularity within section 537 and that as no failure of justice had been
occasioned, the trial was not vitiated. Both the above cases were referred to by the Privy Council in
Babulal Chaukani v. King-Emperor(1).. The question in that case arose as to the true effect of section
239(d), which provides that persons who are (1) 28 I.A. 257.

(2) 541.A. 96, (3) A.I.R. 1938 P.C. 130, accused of different offences committed in the course of the
same transaction may be charged and tried together. The question was whether the correctness of
the joinder which depends on the sameness of the transaction is to be determined by looking at the
accusation or by looking at the result of the trial. It was held that the relevant point of time is the
time of accusation and not that of the eventual result. The charges in this case were conspiracy to
steal electricity and theft of electricity both under the Electricity Act and under the Penal Code. The
Privy Council referred to the fact that the parties had treated an infringement of section 239(d) as an
illegality vitiating the trial under the rule stated in Subramania Ayyar v. King Emperor(1) as
contrasted with the result of irregularity as held in Abdul Rahman v. The King,, Emperor (2) . The
Privy Council merely assumed it to be so without thinking it necessary to discuss the precise scope of
the decision in Subramania's case, because in their view the question did not arise. Again in
Pulukuri Kottaya and Others v. Emperor (3) the Privy Council treated a breach of the provisions of
section 162 of the Code as a mere irregularity curable under section 537 and as no prejudice was
caused in the particular circumstances of that case, the trial was held valid. Reference was made to
Subramania Ayyar v. King-Emperor(1) as one dealing with the mode of trial in which no question of
curing any irregularity arises but if there is some error or irregularity in the conduct of the trial, even
though it may amount to a breach of one or more of the provisions of the Code, it was a mere
irregularity and in support of this reference was made to Abdul Rahman v. The King-Emperor(1).
Several decisions of the High Courts were referred to in course of the arguments with a view to
showing what is the true state of the law in view of the Privy Council decisions referred to above but

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1576995/ 5Aftab Ahmad Khan vs The State Of Hyderabad on 6 May, 1954

we do not think that that question arises in the present case. We are of opinion that the present is
not a case under section 233 of the Code and it is, therefore, unnecessary to consider whether the
violation of its provisions amounts to an illegality vitiating the trial altogether (1) 28 I.A. 257.

(2) 54 1.A. 96.
(3) A.I.R. 1947 P.C. 67.

or it is a mere irregularity which can be condoned under section 537. Section 233 embodies the
general law as to the joinder of charges and lays down a rule that for every distinct offence there
should be a separate charge and every: such charge should be tried separately. There is no doubt
that the object of section 233 is to save the accused from being embarrassed in his defence if distinct
offences are lumped together in one charge or in separate charges and are tried together but the
Legislature has engrafted certain exceptions upon this rule contained in sections 234, 235, 236 and
239. Having regard to the facts and the circumstances of this case, we are of opinion that the present
case falls under section 235. It provides that if in one series of acts so connected together as to form
the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged
with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence. The prosecution story as disclosed in the evidence
clearly shows that the offence of extortion committed on the 14th September was one of a series of
acts connected with the offence of murder and attempt to murder committed on the previous day in
such a way as to form the same transaction. The prosecution case was that when the appellant
accompanied by his party came, he caught hold of two persons (P.W. 5 and P.W. 9) at Rajole and
proceeded to Korivi. He took them into custody without any rhyme or reason. Then outside the
village seeing the deceased, P.W. 2, P.W. 3 and P. W. 4 he shot at them. The deceased fell down
while the others ran away. He pursued them and brought two of them back to the spot where the
deceased was lying but was yet alive. He shot him in the chest and killed him. Then he proceeded to
the village itself where he stayed for the night. He released P. W. 3 and P. W. 4 on the intercession of
certain persons but kept P. W. 5 and P. W. 9 in wrongful confinement and released them only next
morning after extorting Rs. 200 from P. W. 5. These incidents related in the evidence leave no
manner of doubt that from the moment the appellant started from the Police Station, he committed
a series of acts involving killing, injuring people, unlawfully confining others and extorting money
from one of them. We are satisfied that the series of acts attributed to the appellant constitute one
transaction in which the two offences which are alleged to be distinct were committed. The case falls
squarely within the purview of section 235 of the Code and we are, therefore, of opinion that such
misjoinder was permitted by the exception. No question of contravention of any express provision of
the Code such as section 233 arises and in the circumstances it is not necessary for us to consider
how far the violation of any express provisions of the Code relating to the mode of a trial or
otherwise constitutes an illegality which vitiates the trial as distinguished. from an irregularity
which is curable under section 537. This conclusion in our opinion disposes of the contention about
misjoinder of the charges. The fact that the offence of extortion was committed at a different place
and at a different time does not any the less make the act as one committed in the course of the same
transaction. Turning to the merits of the matter, we are not satisfied that any prejudice was caused
to the appellant in fact. It is not possible to say that the Court being influenced by the evidence on
the question of extortion was easily led into the error of believing the evidence on the question of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1576995/ 6Aftab Ahmad Khan vs The State Of Hyderabad on 6 May, 1954

murder. The witnesses on the point of extortion are P.W. 5 and P.W. 9. These are the two persons
who were taken away from village Rajole and were wrongfully confined, P.W. 5 being released on
payment of Rs. 200 and the other let off without payment. These two witnesses are also witnesses to
the fact of murder, in addition to the other three witnesses, P.W. 2, P.W. 3 and P.W. 4. P.W. 5 was
injured by the gun-shot but survived. The other two were scared on hearing the gun-shot and ran
away taking protection under the babul tree. It is not possible to contend that the Sessions Judge
having believed the evidence of extortion from P.W. 5 must have been persuaded into believing that
the story of murder deposed to by him must be correct, for there is not only the evidence of P. W. 5,
but three other inde- pendent witnesses.

Lastly it was contended that the judgment of one of the agreeing Judges Manohar Pershad J. is
purely mechanical and does not show that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case. No such
complaint is made about the judgment of the other agreeing Judge Srinivasachari J. It is true that
the learned Judge has made copious quotations verbatim from the evidence of the witnesses and his
comment upon the evidence is not as full and detailed as might be expected but this practice of
writing judgments in this way seems fairly general in Hyderabad though we cannot help saying that
it is not to be commended. It is the obvious duty of the Court to give a summary of the evidence of
material witnesses and to appraise the evidence with a view to arriving at the conclusion whether
the testimony of the witness should-be believed. We do not think, however, that the criticism that
the judgment is mechanical and does not show a proper appreciation of the evidence is
well-founded. The prosecution evidence was believed by the trial Judge and the defence evidence to
the effect that the deceased was killed by the Military and that the appellant was not present at the
time of the occurrence was disbelieved. This finding was accepted by both the learned agreeing
-Judges. This Court cannot interfere with the finding arrived at, on an appreciation of the evidence.
We are satisfied that there is no good ground for disturbing the conviction of the appellant.

The only question which remains for consideration is whether the sentence of death is the
appropriate sentence in the present case. No doubt there are no special circumstances which justify
the imposition of any other but the normal sentence for the offence of murder. We think, however,
that where the two Judges of the High Court on appeal are divided in their opinion as to the guilt of
the accused and the third Judge to whom reference is made agrees with one of them who is
upholding the conviction and sentence, it seems to us desirable as a matter of convention though
snot as a matter of strict law that ordinarily the extreme penalty should not be imposed. We
accordingly, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant, reduce his sentence to one of
transportation for life. In other respects the appeal stands dismissed. All the sentences will run
concurrently.

HEADNOTE:

The respondent employees were fined by the Appellant Board
for misconduct,duct and various sums were recovered from
them. Therefore, they filed a Claims Application No. 5/72
under Section 33C (2) of the Industrial Disputes Art.
alleging that the said punishment was imposed in violation
of the principles of natural justice. The appellant Board
raised a preliminary objection before the Labour Court that
the Board, a statutory body performing what is in essence a
regal function by providing the basic amenities to the
citizens, is not an industry within the meaning of the
expression under section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, and consequently the employees were not workmen and the
Labour Court had no jurisdiction to decide the claim of the
workmen. This objection being over-ruled, the appellant
Board filed two Writ ‘Petitions viz. Nos. 868 and 2439 of
1973 before the Karnataka High Court at Bangalore. The
Division Bench of that High Court dismissed the petitions
and held that the appellant Board is "industry" within’ the
meaning ‘of the’ ,expression under section 2(i) of the
Industrial, Disputes Act, 1947. The appeals by Special
Leave, considering "the chances of confusion from the crop
‘of cases in an area where the common man has to’ understand
and apply the law and the desirability that there should be,
? comprehensive, clear and conclusive declaration as to what
is an industry under the Industrial Disputes Act as
Stands" were placed for consideration by a larger Bench.
HELD Per M. H. Beg, C.J. (concurring with Bhagwati, Krishna
Iyer and Desai, JJ.

1. The term "analogous to the trade or business" could not
cut down the scope of the term "industry". The said words
can reasonably mean only activity which results in goods
made and manufactured or service rendered which are capable
of being converted into saleable ones. They must be capable
of entering the world of "res commercium", although they may
be kept out of the market for some reason. It is not _ the
motive of an activity in making goods or running a_ service
but the possibility of making them marketable if one _ who
makes goods or renders service so desires, that should
determine whether the activity lies within the domain or
circle of industry. But even this may not be always a
Satisfactory test. By this test the type of services which
are rendered purely for the satisfaction of spiritual or
psychological urges of persons’ rendering those services
would be excluded. Whenever an industrial dispute would
arise between either employers and their workmen or between
workmen and workmen, it should be considered an area within

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

the sphere of "industry" but not otherwise. In other words,
the nature of the activity will be determined by _ the
conditions which give rise to the likelihood of the occurrence of such disputes and their actual occurrence in _ the
sphere.

Certain public utility services which are carried out by

1. Section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act (1947)

wide as the Legislature could have possibly made them. The
problem of what limitations could and should be’ reasonably
read in interpreting the wide words used in section 2(j) 1s
far too. policy oriented to be satisfactorily settled by
judicial decisions. The Parliament must step in and
legislate in ‘a manner which will leave no doubt as to its
intention. That alone can afford a satisfactory solution to
the question which has agitated and perplexed the judiciary
at all levels. [284H, 286A-B]

2 Hospital Mazdoor Sabha was correctly decided in so far
as it held that the JJ Group of hospitals was an _ industry
but the same cannot be said in regard to the view of the
Court that certain activities ought to be treated as falling
outside the definition clause. [287C-D]

3. There is no justification for excepting the categories
of public utility activities undertaken by the Government in
the exercise of its inalienable function,., under’ the
constitution, call it regal or sovereign or by any other
name, from the definition of "industry". If it be. true
that one must have regard to the nature of the activity and
not to who engages in it, it is beside the point to enquire
whether the activity is undertaken by the State, and
further, if so, whether it is undertaken in fulfilment of
the State's constitutional obligations or in discharge of
its constitutional functions. In fact, to concede the
benefit of an exception to the State's activities which are
in the nature of sovereign functions is really to have
regard not so much to the nature of the activity as to the
consideration who engages in that activity; for, sovereign
functions can only be discharged by the State and not by a
private person. If the State's inalienable functions are
excepted from the sweep of the definition contained in
section 2(]j) , one shall have it is the nature of the
activity is an industry. Indeed, in this respect, it should
make no difference whether

209

on the one hand, an activity is undertaken by a_ corporate
body in the discharge of its statutory functions or, on the
other, by the State itself in the exercise of its
inalienable functions. If the water supply and sewerage
schemes or fire fighting establishments run by a
Municipality can be industries sought to be the manufacture
of coins and currency, arms and ammunition and the winning
of oil and uranium. The fact that these latter kinds of
activities are, or can only be, undertaken by the State does
not furnish any answer to the question whether’ these
activities are industries. When undertaken by a private
individual they are industries, therefore, when under
taken by the State,they are industries. The nature of the
activity is the determining factor and that does not’ change
according to who undertakes it. Items 8, 11, 12, 17 and18
of the First Schedule read with section 2 (n) (vi) of the
Industrial Disputes Act render support to this view. These
provisions which were described in Hospital Mazdoor Sabha as
‘very significant' at least show that, conceivably, a
Defence Establishment, a Mint or a Security Press can be an
industry even though these activities are, ought to be and
can only be undertaken by the State in the discharge of its
constitutional obligations or functions. The State does not
trade when it prints a currency note or strikes a_ coin. And
yet, considering the nature of the activity, it is engaged
inan industry when it does so. [287E-H, 288A-B]

4. A systematic activity which is organised or arranged
in a mannerin which the trade or business is generally
Organised or arranged would bean industry despite the
fact that it proceeds from charitable motives. It is inthe
nature of the activity that one has to consider and it is
upon the application of that test that the State's
inalienable functions fall within the definition of
industry. The very same principles must yield the result
that just as the consideration as to who conducts’ the
activity, is irrelevant for determining whether the activity
is an industry so is the fact that the activity is
charitable in nature or is undertaken with a_ charitable
motive. The status or capacity corporate or constitutional,
of the employer would have, if at all, closer nexus, than
his motive on the question whether the activity is an
industry. The motive which propels the activity is_ yet
another step removed and ex hypothesi can have no relevance
on the question as to what is the nature of the activity.
It is never true to say that the nature of the activities is
charitable. The subjective motive force of an activity can
be charity but for the purpose of deciding whether an
activity iS an industry one has to look at the process
involved in the activity, objectively. The jural foundation
of any attempt to except charitable enterprises from. the
scope of the definition can only be that' such enterprises
are not undertaken for profit. But then, that clearly, is
to introduce the profit concept by a, side wind, a_ concept
which has been rejected consistently over the years. If any
principle can be said to be settled law in this vexed field
it is this : the twin consideration of profit motive and
Capital investment is irrelevant for determining whether an
activity is an industry. Therefore, activities which are
dominated by charitable motives either in the sense that
they involve the rendering of free or near free services or
in the sense that the profits which they yield are diverted
to charitable purposes, are not beyond the pale of _ the
definition of section 2(j). It is as much beside the point
to inquire who is the employer as it is to inquire, why is
the activity undertaken and what the employer does with’ the
profits, if any. [288C-H, 289A]
5.By this test a Solicitor's establishment would be an
industry. A Solicitor undoubtedly does not carry on a trade
or business when he acts for his client or advises him or
pleads for him, if and when pleading is permissible to him.
He pursues a profession which is variously and justifiably
described as learned, liberal or noble. But it is difficult
to infer from the language of the definition in section 2(j)
that the Legislature could not have intended to bring in a
liberal profession like that of an Attorney within the ambit
of the definition of ‘industry'. [289A-B]

6.In Hospital Mazdoor Sabha the Court while evolving a
working principle stated that an _ industrial activity
generally involves, inter alia, the cooperation of the
employer and the employees. That the production of goods or
the rendering of material services to the community must be
the direct and proximate result of such cooperation is a
further extension of that principle and it is broadly by the
application thereof that a Solicitor's establishment is held
not to attract the definition clause. These refinements
are, with respect not warranted by the words of _ the
definition, apart from the consideration that in practice
they make the application of the definition to concrete
cases dependent upon a factual assessment so highly
Subjective as to lead to confusion and uncertainty in the
understanding of the true legal position. Granting that the
Language of the definition is so wide that some Limitation
ought to be read into it, one must stop at a point beyond
which the definition will skid into a domain too rarefied to
be realistic. Whether the cooperation between the employer
and the employee is the proximate cause of the ultimate
product and bears direct nexus with it is a test which is
almost impossible of application with any degree of
assurance or certitude. It will be as much true to say that
the Solicitor's Assistant, Managing Clerk, Librarian and the
Typist do not directly contribute to the intellectual end
product which is a creation of his’ personal professional
Skill, as that, without their active assistance’ and
cooperation it will be impossible for him to- function
effectively. The unhappy state of affairs in which the’ law
is marooned will continue to baffle the skilled professional
and his employees alike as also the Judge who has to perform
the unenviable task of sitting in judgment over’ the
directness of the cooperation between the employer and the
employee, until such time as the legislature decides to
manifest its intention by the use of clear and indubious
Language. Beside the fact that this Court has so held ‘in
National Union of Commercial Employees the legislature will
find a plausible case for exempting the learned and liberal
professions of Lawyers, Solicitors, Doctors, Engineers,
Chartered Accountants and the like from the operation of
industrial laws. But until that happens, in the present
State of the law it is difficult by judicial interpretation
to create exemptions in favour of any particular class.
[289C-H]

7.The case of the clubs, on the present definition is
weaker still. The definition squarely covers them and there
is no justification for amending the law so as_ to exclude
them from the operation of the industrial laws. The fact
that the running of clubs is not a calling of the club or
its managing committee, that the club has no existence apart
from its members that it exists for its members’ though
occasionally strangers take the benefit of its services and

that even after the admission of guests, the club remains a
members' self-serving institution does not touch the core of
the problem. [290A-B]

(1)'Industry as defined 'in Sec. 2(j) and explained in
Banerji's case has a wide import. [282A]

I.(a) Where (i) systematic activity, (ii) organized by
cooperation between employer and employee (the direct and
Substantial element is chimerical); (111) for the production
and/or distribution of goods and services calculated to
Satisfy human wants and wishes (not spiritual or’ religious,
but inclusive of material things or services geared to
celestial bliss e.g. making, on a large scale prasad or
food), prima facie there is an ‘industry' in that
enterprise.

(b) Absence of profit motive or gainful objective is
irrelevant, be the venturein the public, joint, private

or other sector.

(c) The true focus is functional and the decisive test 15s
the nature of the activity with special emphasis on _ the
employer-employee relations.

(d) If the Organisation is a trade or business it does not
cease to be one becauseof philanthropy animating’ the
undertaking. [282A-C]

II. Althoughsection 2(j) uses words of the widest
amplitude in its two limbs, their meaning cannot be
magnified to overreach itself. [282D]

211

(a) 'Undertaking' must suffer a contextual and
associational shrinkage as explained in Banerji and in this
judgment; so also, service, calling and the _ like. This

yields the inference that all organized activity possessing
the triple elements in I (Supra), although not trade or
business, may still be ‘industry’ provided the nature of the
activity, viz. the  employer-employee basis. bears
resemblance to what we find in trade or _ business. This
takes into the fold of ‘industry’ undertakings, callings and
services, adventures' analogous to the carrying on of trade
or business'. ALl features, other than the methodology of
carrying on the activity viz. in organizing the cooperation
between employer and employee, may be dissimilar. It does
not, matter, if on the employment terms there is analogy.
[282D-E]

III.Application of these guidelines should not stop- short
of their logical reachby invocation of creeds, cults or
inner sense of incongruity or outer senseof motivation

for or resultant of the economic operations. The ideology
of the Act being industrial peace, regulation and resolution
of industrial disputes between employer and workmen, the
range of this statutory ideology must inform the reach of
the statutory definition. Nothing less, nothing more.
(a)The consequences are (i) professions, (ii) clubs (111)

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

educational institutions (iv) cooperatives, (v) research
institutes (vi) charitable projects and (vii) other kindred
adventures, if they fulfil the triple tests listed in
(supra), cannot be exempted from the scope of section 2(j).
(b)A restricted category of, professions, clubs,
cooperatives and even gurukulas and little research labs,
may qualify for exemption if, in Simple ventures,
Substantially and going by the dominant nature criterion,
Substantively no employees are entertained but in minimal
matters, marginal employees are hired. without destroying
the non-employee character of the unit.

(c)If, in a pious or altruistic mission, many employ
themselves, free or for small honoraria or tlike- return,
mainly drawn by sharing in the purpose or cause, such as
Lawyers volunteering to run a free legal services clinic or
doctors serving in their spare hours in a free medical
centre on asramites working at the bidding of the holiness,
divinity or like central personality, and the services are
Supplied free or at nominal cost and those who serve are not
engaged for remuneration or on the basis of master and
servant relationship, then the institution is not an
industry even if stray servants, manual or technical, are
hired. Such eleemosynary or like undertakings alone are
exempt-not other generosity, compassion, developmental
passion or project. [282F-H, 283A-C]

IV. The dominant nature test

(a)Where a complex of activities, some of which qualify
for exemption, others not, involves employees on the total
undertaking, some of whom Are not ‘workmen' as in_ the
University of Delhi case or some departments are not
‘productive of goods and services if isolated, even then,
the predominant nature of the services and the integrated
nature of the departments as explained in the Corporation of
Nagpur, will be the true test. The whole undertaking will
be ‘industry' although those who are not '‘workmen' by
definition may not benefit by the status.

(b)Notwithstanding the previous’ clauses, sovereign
functions, Strictly understood, (alone), qualify for
exemption, not the welfare activities of economic adventures
undertaken by Government or statutory bodies.

(c)Even in departments discharging sovereign functions if
there are units which are industries and they are
Substantially severable, then they can be considered to come
within sec. 2(j).

(d)Constitutionally and competently enacted legislative
provisions may well remove from the scope of the Act
categories which otherwise may be covered thereby. [283C-F]

of employees employed by the professionals to the value of

adopted and the conclusions reached by my learned brother Krishna lyer. I would, however, like to
add my reasons for this agreement and to indicate my approach to a problem where relevant
legislation leaves so much for determination by the Court as to enable us to perform a function very
akin to legislation.

My learned brother has relied on what was considered in England a somewhat unorthodox method
of construction in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher(1), where Lord Denning, L.J., said :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 10Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

"When a defect appears a judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the
draftsman. He must set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of
Parliament and then he must supplement the written words so as to give 'force and
life' to the intention of legislature. A judge should ask himself the question how, if the
makers of the (1) [1949] 2 All. E. R. 15 5 at 164.

Act had themselves come across this ruck in the texture of it, they would have
straightened it out? He must then do as they would have done. A judge must not alter
the material of which the Act is woven, but he can and should iron out the creases".

When this case went up to the House of Lords it appears that the Law Lords disapproved of the bold
effort of Lord Denning to make ambiguous legislation more comprehensible. Lord Simonds found it
to be "a naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation’. Lord
Morton (with whom Lord Goddard entirely agreed) observed : "These heroics are out of place" and
Lord Tucker, said "Your Lordships would be acting in a legislative rather than a judicial capacity if
the view put forward by Denning, L.J., were to prevail". Perhaps, with the passage of time, what may
be described as the extension of a method resembling the "arm chair rule" in the construction of
wills, judges can more frankly step into the shoes of the legislature where an enactment leaves its
own intentions in much too nebulous or uncertain a state. In M. Pentiah v. Verramallappa(1),
Sarkar, J. approved of the reasoning, set out above, adopted by Lord Denning. And, I must say that,
in a case where the definition of "industry" is left in the state in which we find it, the situation
perhaps calls for some judicial heroics to cope with the difficulties raised.

In his heroic efforts, my learned brother Krishna Iyer, if I may say so with great respect, has not
discarded the tests of industry formulated in the past. Indeed, he has actually restored the tests laid
down by this Court in D. N. Banerji's case(2), and, after that, in the Corporation of the City of
Nagpur v. Its Employees(3), and State of Bombay & Ors. v. The Hospital Mazdoor Sabha & (OrS.)
(4), to their pristine glory. My learned brother has, however, rejected what may appear, to use the
word employed recently by an American Jurist, "excrescences" of subjective notions of judges which
may have blurred those tests. The temptation is great, in such cases, for us to give expression of
what may be purely subjective personal predilections. It has, however, to be resisted if law is to
possess a direction in Conformity with Constitutional objectives and criteria which must impart that
reasonable state of predictability and certainty to interpretations of the Constitution as well as to the
laws made under it which citizens should expect. We have, so to speak, to chart what may appear to
be a Sea in which the ship of law like Noah's ark may have to be navigated. Indeed, Lord Sankey on
one occasion, said that law itself is like the ark to which people look for some certainty and security
amidst the shifting sands of political life and vicissitudes of times. The Constitution and the directive
principles of State policy, read with the basic fundamental rights, provide us with a compass. This
Court has tried to indicate in recent cases that the meaning of (1)A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 1107 @ 1115.

(2)[1953] S.C.R. 302.

(3)[1960] 2 S.C.R. 942.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 14Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978
(4)[1960] 2 S.C.R. 866.

what could be described as a basic "structure" of the Constitution must necessarily be found in
express provisions of the construction and not merely in subjective notions about meanings of
words. Similar must be the reasoning we must employ in extracting the core of meaning hidden
between the interstices of statutory provisions. Each of us is likely to have a subjective notion about
"industry". For objectivity, we have to look first to the, words used in the statutory provision
defining industry in an attempt to find the meaning. If that meaning is clear, we need proceed no
further. But, the trouble here is that the words found there do not yield a meaning so readily. They
refer to what employers or workers may do as parts of their ordinary avocation or business in life.
When we turn to the meaning given of the term "worker" in Sec. 2(s) of the Act, we are once more
driven back to find it in the bosom of "industry", for the term "worker" is defined as one :

" employed in any industry to do any skilled or unskilled manual, supervisory,
technical or clerical work for hire or reward, whether the terms of employment be
express or implied,, and for the purposes of any proceeding under this Act in relation
to an industrial dispute, includes any such person who has been dismissed,
discharged or retrenched in connection with, or as a consequence of that dispute. or
whose dismissal, discharge or retrenchment has led to that dispute”.

The definition, however, excludes specifically those who are subject to the Army Act 1950 or the Air
Force Act 1950, or the Navy Discipline Act 1934, as well as those who are employed in the Police
Service or Officers and other employees of a Prison, or employed in mainly managerial or
administrative capacities or who, being employed in supervisory capacity, draw wages exceeding Rs.
500/- per mensem.

Thus, in order to draw the "circle of industry", to use the expression of my learned brother Iyer, we
do not find even the term "workman" illuminating. The definition only enables us to see that certain
classes of persons employed in the service of the State are excluded from the purview of industrial
dispute which the Act seeks to provide for in the interests of industrial peace and harmony between
the employers and employees so that the welfare of the nation is secured. The result is that we have
then to turn to the preamble to find the object of the Act itself, to the legislative history of the Act,
and to the socioeconomic ethos and aspirations and needs of the times in which the Act was passed.

The method which has been followed, whether it be called interpretation or construction of a part of
an organic whole in which the statute, its objectives, its past and its direction for the future, its
constitutional setting are all parts of this whole with their correlated functions. Perhaps it is
impossible, in adopting such a method of interpretation, which some may still consider unorthodox,
a certain degree of subjectivity. But our attempt should be not to break with the wellestablished
principles of interpretation in doing so. Progressive rational and beneficial modes of interpretation
import and fit into the body of the old what may be new.It is a process of adaptation for giving new
vitality in keeping with the progress of thought in our times. All this, however, is not really novel,
although we may try to say it in a new way.

If one keeps in mind what was laid down in Heydon's case (supra) referred to by my learned brother
Iyer, the well known principle that a statute must be interpreted as a whole, in the context of all the
provisions of the statute, its objects, the preamble, and the functions of various provisions, the true
meaning may emerge. It may not be strictly adictionary meaning in such cases. Indeed, even in a
modern statute the meaning of a term such as "Industry" may change with a rapidly changed social
and economic structure. For this proposition I can do no better than to quote Subba Rao J. speaking
for this Court in The Senior Electric Inspector v. Laxmi Narayan Chopra(1) "The legal position may
be summarized thus : The maxim contemporanea expositio as laid down by Coke was applied to
construing ancient statutes but not to interpreting Acts which are comparatively modern. There is a
good reason for this change in the mode of interpretation. The fundamental rule of construction is
the same whether the Court is asked to construe a provision of an ancient statute or that of a modem
one, namely, what is the expressed intention of the Legislature. It is perhaps difficult to attribute to
a legislative body functioning in a static society that its intention was couched in terms of
considerable breadth so as to take within its sweep the future developments comprehended by the
phraseology used.. It is more reasonable to confine its intention only to the circumstances obtaining
at the time the law was made. But in a modern progressive society it would be unreasonable to
confine the intention of a Legislature to the meaning attributable to the word used at the time the
law was made, for a modern Legislature making laws to govern a society which is fast moving must
be presumed to be aware of an enlarged meaning the same concept might attract with the march of
time and with the revolutionary changes brought about in social, economic, political and scientific
and other fields of human activity. Indeed, unless a contrary intention appears, an interpretation
should be given to the words used to take in new facts and situations, if the words are capable of
comprehending them."

In the Workmen of Dimakuchi Tea Estate v. The Management of Dimakuchi Tea Estate(2) it was
observed (1) [1962] 3 S.C.R. 146.

(2) [1958] S.C.R. 1156 at 1163.

15-21 1SCI/78 "A little careful consideration will show, however, that the expression "any person”.
occurring in the third part of, the definition clause cannot mean anybody and everybody in this wide
world. First of all the subject matter of dispute must relate to (4) employment or non-employment or
(ii) terms of employment or conditions of labour of any person; these necessarily import it
limitation in the sense that a person in respect of whom the employer-employee relation never
existed or can never possibly exist cannot be the subject matter of a dispute between employers and
workmen. Secondly, the definition clause must be read in the context of the subject matter and
scheme of the Act, and consistently with the objects and other provisions of the Act. It is well settled
that "the words of a statute, when there is a doubt about their meaning are to be understood in the
sense in which they best harmonise with the subject of the enactment and the object which the
Legislature has in view. Their meaning is found not so much in strictly grammatical or etymological
propriety of language, nor even in its popular use, as in the subject or in the occasion on which they
are used,, and the object to be attained." (Maxwell, Inter- pretation of Statutes, , 9th Edition, p. 55).
It was also said there :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 13Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

"It is necessary, therefore, to take the Act as a whole and examine its salient provisions. The long
title shows that the object of the Act is "to make provision for the in
vestigation and settlement of industrial disputes, and for certain other purposes." The preamble
states the same object and s. 2 of the Act which contains definitions states that unless there is
anything repugnant in the subject or context, certain expressions will have certain meanings."

Thus, it is in the context of the purpose of the Act that the meaning of the term ‘industry' was
sought. Again dealing with the objects of the Act before us in Budge Municipality case(1) this Court
said :

"When our Act came to be passed, labour disputes had already assumed big
proportions and there were clashes between workmen and employers in several
instances. We can assume that it was to meet such a situation that the Act was
enacted, and it is consequently necessary to give the terms employed in the Act
referring to such disputes as wide an import as reasonably possible." In that very case
this Court also said (at p.

308):

"There is nothing, however, to prevent a statute from giving the word "industry" and the words
"industrial dispute" a wider and more comprehensive import in order to (1) [1953] S.C.R. 302 at
310.

meet the requirements of rapid industrial progress and to bring about in the interests of industrial
peace and economy, a fair and satisfactory adjustment of relations between employers and workmen
in a variety of fields of activity. It is obvious that the limited concept of what an industry meant in
early times must now yield place to an enormously wider concept so as to take in various and varied
forms of industry, so that disputes arising in connection with them might be settled quickly without
much dislocation and disorganisation of the needs of the society and in a manner more adapted to
conciliation and settlement than a determination of the respective rights and liabilities according to
strict legal procedure and principles." Again, in Hospital Mazdoor Sabha case(1) this Court said:

"If the object and scope of the statute are considered there would be no difficulty in holding that the
relevant words of wide import have been deliberately used by the Legislature in defining "industry"
in Sec. 2(j). The object of the Act was to make provision for the investigation and settlement of
industrial disputes, and the extent and scope of the provisions would be realised if we bear in mind
the definition of "industrial disputes" given by Section 2(k), of "wages" by Section 2(rr), "workmen"
by Section 2(s), and of "employer" by Section 2(g)."

It added:

"It is obvious that the words used in an inclusive definition denote extension and cannot be treated
as restricted in any sense." I may here set out the definition given by the Act of the term ‘industry’ in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 14Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

section 2, sub. s. (j) "G) "Industry" means any business, trade, undertaking, manufacture or calling
of employers and includes any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or
avocation of workmen;"

It seems to me that the definition was not meant to provide more than a guide. It raises doubts as to
what could be meant by the "calling of employers" even if business, trade, undertaking or
manufacture could be found capable of being more clearly delineated. It is clear that there is no
mention here of any profit motive. Obviously, the word "Manufacture" of employers could not be
interpreted liter- aliy. It merely means a process of manufacture in which the employers may be
engaged. It is, however, evident that the term 'employer' necessarily postulates employees without
whom there can be no employers. But, the second part of the definition makes " the concept more
nebulous as it, obviously, extends the definition to any calling, (1) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 866 at 875.

service, employment, handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen". I have already
examined the meaning of the term " workman" which refers us back to what is an "industry". it
seems to me that the second part, relating to workmen, must necessarily indicate something which
may exclude employers and include an "industry It consisting of individual handicraftsmen or
workmen only. At any rate, the meaning of industrial disputes includes disputes between workmen
and workmen also. Therefore, I cannot see how we can cut down the wide ambit of last part of the
definition by searching for the predominant meaning in the first part unless we were determined, at
the outset, to curtail the scope of the second part somehow. If we do that, we will be deliberately
cutting down the real sweep of the last part. Neither "Noscitur a sociis" rule nor the " ejusdem
generis" rule are adequate for such a case.

There is wisdom in the suggestion that in view of these difficulties in finding the meaning of the
term ‘industry’, as defined in the Act, it is best to say that an industry cannot strictly be defined but
can only be described. But, laying down such a rule may again leave too wide a door open for
speculation and subjective notions as to what is describable as an industry. It is, perhaps, better to
look for a rough rule of guidance in such a case by considering what the concept of 'industry' must
exclude. I think the phrase ‘analogous to industry’, which has been used in the Safdarjung Hospital
case (supra) could not really cut down the scope of "industry". The result, however, of that decision
has been that the scope has been cut down. 1, therefore, completely agree with my learned brother
that the decisions of this Court in Safdarjung Hospital case and other cases mentioned by my
learned brother must be held to be overruled. It seems to me that the term ‘analogous to trade or
business, could reasonably mean only activity which results in goods made or manufactured or
services rendered which are capable of being converted into saleable ones. They must be capable of
entering the world of "res commercium although they may be, kept out of the market for some
reason. It is not the motive of an activity in making goods or rendering a service, but the possibility
of making them marketable if one who makes goods or renders services, so desires, that should
determine whether the activity lies within the domain or circle of industry. But, even this may not be
always a, satisfactory test.

The test indicated above would necessarily exclude the type of services which are rendered purely
for the satisfaction of spiritual or psychological urges of persons rendering those services. These

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 15Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

cannot be bought or sold. For persons rendering such services there may be no ‘industry’, but, for
persons who want to benefit from the services rendered, it could become an "industry". When
services are rendered by groups of charitable individuals to themselves or others out of missionary
zeal and purely charitable motives, there would hardly be any need to invoke-the provisions of the
industrial Disputes Act to protect them. Such is not the type of persons who will raise such a dispute
as workmen or employees whatever they may be doing.

This leads one on to consider another kind of test. It is that, wherever an industrial dispute could
arise between either employers and their workmen or between workmen and workmen, it should be
considered an area within the sphere of 'industry' but not otherwise In other words, the nature of
the activity will lie determined by the conditions which give rise to the likelihood of occurrence of
such disputes and their actual occurrence in the sphere. This may be a pragmatic test. For example,
a lawyer or a Solicitor could not raise a dispute with his litigants in general on the footing that they
were his employers. Nor could doctors raise disputes with their patients on such a footing. Again,
the personal character of the relationship between a doctor and his assistant and a lawyer and his
clerk may be of such a kind that it requires complete confidence and harmony in the productive
activity in which they may be cooperating so that, unless the operations of the solicitor or the lawyer
or the doctor take an organised and systematised form of a business or trade, employing a number
of persons, in which disputes could arise between employers and their employees, they would not
enter the field of industry. The same type of activity may have both industrial and non-industrial
aspects or sectors. I would also like to make a few observations about the so called " sovereign’
functions which have been placed outside the field of industry. I do not feel happy about the use of
the term "sovereign" here. I think that the term 'sovereign' should be reserved, technically and more
correctly, for the sphere of ultimate decisions. Sovereignty operates on a sovereign plane of its own
as I suggested in Keshvananda Bharati's case (1)- Supported by a quotation from Ernest Barker's
"Social and Political Theory". Again, the term "Regal", from which the term "sovereign" functions
appears to be derived, seems to be a misfit in a Republic where the citizen shares the political
sovereignty in which he has even a legal share; however small, in as much as he exercises the right to
vote. What is meant by the use of the term "sovereign", in relation to the activities of the State, is
more accurately brought out by using the term "governmental" functions although there are
difficulties here also in as much as the Government has entered largely now fields of industry.
Therefore, only those services which are governed by separate rules and constitutional provisions,
such as Article 310 and 311 should, strictly speaking, be-excluded from the sphere of industry by
necessary implication.

I am impressed by the argument that certain public utility services which are carried out by
governmental agencies or corporations are treated by the Act itself as within the sphere of industry.
If express rules under other enactments govern the relationship between the State as an employer
and its servants; as employees it may be contended, on the strength of such provisions, that a
particular set of employees are outside the scope of the Industrial Disputes Act for that reason. The,
special excludes the applicability of the general. We cannot (1) 1973 Sup.S. C. R. P 1 forget that we
have to determine the meaning of the term ‘industry in the context of and for the purposes of
matters provided for in the Industrial Disputes Act only. I have contented myselfwith a very brief
and hurried outline of my line of thinking partly because I am in agreement with the conclusions of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 16Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

mylearned brother Iyer and I also endorse his reasoning almost whollybut even more because the
opinion I have dictated just now must be given today if I have to deliver- it at all. From tomorrow I
cease to have any authority as a Judge to deliver it. Therefore, I have really no time to discuss the
large number of cases cited before us, including those on what are known as "sovereign" functions.

I will, however, quote a passage from State of Rajasthan v. Mst. Vidyawati & Anr.(1) where this
Court said :

"In this connection it has to be remembered that under the Constitution we have
established a welfare state, whose functions are not confined only to maintaining law
and order but extend to engaging in all activities including industry, public transport,
state trading, to name only a few of them. In so far as the State activities have such
wide ramifications involving not only the use of sovereign powers but also its powers
as employers in so many public sectors, it is too much to claim that the State should
be immune from the consequences of tortious acts of its employees committed in the
course of their employment as such."

I may also quote another passage from Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Mohan Lal(2) to show
that the State today increasingly undertakes commercial functions and economic activities and
services, as part of its duties in a welfare state. The Court said there :

"Under the Constitution, the State is itself envisaged as having the right to carry on
trade or business as mentioned in Art. 19(1)

(g). In Part IV, the State has been given the same meaning as in Art. 12 and one of the
Directive Principles laid down in Art. 46 is that the State shall pro-mote with special
care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people. The
State, as defined in Art. 12, is thus comprehended to include bodies created for the
purpose of promoting the educational and economic interests of the people. The
State, as constituted by our Constitution, is further specifically empowered under Art.
298 to carry on any trade or business. The circumstances that the Board under the
Electricity Supply Act is, required to carry on some activities of the-nature of trade or
commerce does not, therefore, give any indication that the Board must be excluded
from the scope of the word "State" as used in Art. 12."

Hence, to artificially exclude State run industries from the sphere of the Act, unless statutory
provisions, expressly or by a necessary implication have that effect, would not be correct. The
question is one which can only be solved by more satisfactory legislation on it. Otherwise, Judges
could only speculate and formulate tests of ,"industry" which cannot satisfy all. Perhaps to seek to
satisfy all is to cry for the moon.

For the reasons given above, I endorse the opinion and the conclusions of my learned brother
Krishna Iyer. KRISHNA IYER, J.-The rather zigzag, course of the landmark cases and the tangled
web of judicial thought have perplexed one branch of Industrial Law, resulting from obfuscation of
the basic concept of 'industry' under the, Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short, the Act). This
bizarre situation, 30 years after the Act was passed and industrialization bad advanced on a national
scale, could not be allowed to continue longer. So, the urgent need for an authoritative resolution of
this confused position which has survived indeed, has been accentuated by-the judgment of this
six-member bench in Safdar Jung(1), if we may say so with deep respect, has led to a reference to a
larger bench of this diehard dispute as to what an ‘industry’ under Section 2(j) means.

Legalese and logomachy have the genius to inject mystique into common words, alienating the laity
in effect from the rule of law. What is the common worker or ordinary employer to do if he is
bewildered by a definitional dilemma, and is unsure whether his. enterprise say, a hospital,
university, a library, a service club, a local body, a research institute, a pinjarapole, a chamber of
commerce, a Gandhi Ashram-is an industry at all ? Natural meaning is nervous of acceptance in
court where the meaning of meanings is lost in uncertain erudition and cases have even cancelled
each other out while reading meaning.

"I do not think" said Diplock L.J., that anywhere, except in a court of law, it would be
argued with gravity that a Dutch barn or grain and fodder stores or any ordinary farm
buildings are properly described as repositories. A Gloucester shire farmers would
say they were farm buildings and would laugh at their being called 'repositories." in
the same spirit, Stamp J. rejected the argument that the carrying on of the business
of a crematorium involved the " subjection of goods or materials to any process"
within section 271 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act 1952 as a distortion of the English
language......

I protest against subjecting the English language, and more particularly simple English phrase, to
this kind of process of philology and semasiology." (2) (1)Management of Safdarjung Hospital, New
Delhi, v. Kuldip Singh Sethi [1971] 1 S.C.R. 177.

Esoterica is anathema for law affecting the common man in the commerce of life, and so the starting
point for our discussion is the determination to go by the plain, not the possible, sense of the words
used in the definition, informed by the, context and purpose of the statute, illumined by its scheme
and getting and conceptually coloured by what is an industry at the current developmental stag& in
our country. In our system of precedents our endeavour must be, as urged by counsel, to reconcile
prior pronouncements, if possible, and to reconsider the question altogether, if necessary. , There
are no absolutes in law since life, which it serves, is relative. 'What is an industry in America or the
Soviet Union may not be one in India and even in our Country what was not an industry decades ago
may well be one now. Our judgment here has so pontifical flavour but seeks to serve the future hour
till changes in the law or industrial culture occur. Law, especially industrial law, which regulates the
rights and remedies of the working class, unfamiliar with the sophistications of definitions and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 18Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

shower of decisions, unable to secure expert legal opinion,. what with poverty pricing them out of
the justice market and denying them the staying power to withstand the multi decked litigative
process, de facto denies social justice if legal drafting is vagarious, definitions indefinite and court
rulings contradictory. Is it possible, that the legislative chambers are too preoccupied with other
pressing business to listen to court signals calling for clarification of ambiguous clauses ? A careful,
prompt amendment. of Sec. 2(j) would have preempted this docket explosion before tribunals and
courts. This Court, perhaps more than the legislative and Executive branches, is deeply concerned
with law's delays and to devise a prompt delivery system of social justice.

Though the tailoring of a definition is the sole forensic job in this batch of appeals, dependent on
which, perhaps, a few thousand other cases await decision, the cycloramic semantics of the simple
word ‘industry’ and the judicial gloss on it in a catena of cases, have led to an avoidable glut of
labour litigation where speedy finality and working criteria are most desirable. And this delay in
disposal of thousands of, disputes and consequent partial paralysis in the industrial life is partly
blamable on the absence of a mechanism of communication between the court and the law- making
chambers.

The great American judge, Justice Cardozo, while he was Chief Justice of New York Supreme Court.,
made this point:

"The Courts are not helped as they could and ought to be in the adaptation of law to
justice. The reason they are not helped is because there is no one whose business it is
to give warning that help is needed....... We must have a courier who will carry the
tidings of distress........ Today courts and legislative work in separation and aloofness.
The penalty is paid both in the wasted effort of production and in the lowered quality
of the product. On the one side, the judges, left to fight against anachronism and
injustice by the methods of judge-made law, are distracted by the conflicting
promptings of justice and logic, of consistency and mercy, and the output of their
labors bears the tokens of the strain. On the other side, the legislature, informed only
casually and intermittently of the needs and problems of the courts, without expert or
responsible or disinterested or systematic advice as to the workings of one rule or
another, patches the fabric here and there, and mars often when it would mend.
Legislature and courts move ,on in proud and silent isolation. Some agency must be
found to mediate between them."

The grave disquiet about arrears in courts must be accompanied by deeper insights into newer
methodology than collection of, statistics and minor reforms. Appreciating the urgency of quick
justice a component of social justice, as a priority item on the agenda of Law Reforms and
suspecting public unawareness of some essential aspects of the problem, we make these painful
observations. This obiter exercise is in discharge of the court's obligation to inform the community
in our developing country where to look for the faults in the legal order and how to take meaningful
corrective measures. The courts too have a constituency the nation-and a manifesto-the
Constitution. That is the validation of this ,divagation. Back to the single problem of thorny
simplicity : what is an ‘industry' ? Historically speaking, this Indian statute has its beginnings in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 19Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

Australia, even as the bulk of our corpus juris, with a colonial favour, is a carbon copy of English
law. Therefore, in interpretation, we may seek light Australasially, and so it is that the precedents of
this- court have drawn on Australian cases as on English dictionaries. But India is India and its
individuality, in law and society, is attested by its National Charter, so that statutory construction
must be home-spun even if hospitable to alien thinking.

The reference to us runs thus:

"One should have thought that an activist Parliament by taking quick policy decisions
and by resorting to amendatory processes would have simplified, clarified and
de-limited the definition of "industry", and, if we may add "workman". Had this been
done with aware and alert speed by the legislature, litigation which is the besetting
sin of industrial life could well have been avoided to a considerable degree. That
consummation may perhaps happen on a distant day, but this Court has to decide
from day to day disputes involving this branch of industrial law and give guidance by
declar- ing what is an industry, through the process of interpretation and
reinterpretation, with a murky accumulation of case law.

Counsel on both sides have chosen to rely on Safdar Jung each emphasising one part
or other of the decision as supporting his argument. Rulings of this- Court before and
after have revealed no unanimity nor struck any unison and so, we confess to our
inability to discern any golden thread running through the string of decisions bearing
on the issue at hand."

",... the chance of confusion from the crop of cases in an area where the common man
has to understand and apply the law makes it desirable that there should be a
compre- hensive, clear and conclusive declaration as to what is an industry under the
Industrial Disputes Act as it now stands. Therefore, we think it necessary to place this
case before the learned Chief Justice for consideration by a larger Bench. If in the
meantime the Parliament does not act, this Court may have to illumine the twilight
area of law and help the industrial community carry on smoothly So, the long and
short of it is, what is an industry? Section 2 (j) defines it : " 'industry' means any
business, trade, undertaking, manufacture or calling of employers and includes any
calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of
workmen:"

Let us put it plain The canons of construction are trite that we must read the statute as a whole to
get a hang of it and a holistic perspective of it. We must have regard to the historical background,
objects and reasons, international thought ways, popular understanding, contextual connotation
and suggestive subject-matter. Equally important, dictionaries, while not absolutely binding, are
aids to ascertain meaning. Nor are we writing on a tabula. rosa. Since Banerjee,(1) decided a silver
jubilee span of years ago, we have a heavy harvest of rulings on what is an 'industry' and we have to
be guided by the variorum of criteria stated therein, as far as possible, and not spring a creative
surprise on the industrial community by a stroke of freak originality. Another sobering sign. In a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 20Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

world of relativity I where law and life interlace, a search for absolutes is a self- condemned exercise.
Legal concepts, ergo, are relativist, and to miss this rule of change and developmental stage is to
interpret oneself into error.

Yet a third signpost. The functional focus of this industrial legislation and the social perspective of
Part IV of the Paramount Law drive us to hold that the dual goals of the Act are contentment of
workers and peace in the industry and judicial interpretation should be geared to their fulfilment,
not their frustration. A worker-oriented statute must receive a construction where conceptually. the
keynote thought must be the worker and the community, as the Constitution has shown concern for
them, inter-alia, in Articles 38, 39 and 43.

(1) [1953] S.C.R. 302.

A look at the definition, dictionary in hand, decisions in head and Constitution at heart, leads to
some sure characteristics of an ‘industry’, narrowing down the twilit zone of turbid controversy. An
industry is a continuity, is an organized activity, is a purposeful pursuit-not any isolated adventure ,
desultory excursion or casual, fleeting engagement motivelessly undertaken. Such is the common
feature of a trade, business, calling, manufacture- mechanical or handicraft based-service,
employment, industrial occupation or avocation. For those who know English and are not given to
the luxury of splitting semantic hairs, this conclusion argues itself. The expression 'Undertaking' can
not be torn off the words whose company it keeps. If birds of a feather flock together and noscitur a
soclis is a commonsense guide to construction, 'undertaking' must be read down to conform to the
restrictive characteristic shared by the society of words before and after. Nobody will torture
‘undertaking in Section 2(j) to mean meditation or musheira which are spiritual and aesthetic
undertakings. Wide meanings must fall in line and discordance must be excluded from a sound
system. From Banerjee to Safdar Jung and beyond, this limited criterion has passed muster and we
see no reason, after all the marathon of argument, to shift from this position.

Likewise, an 'industry' cannot exist without co-operative endeavyour between employer and
employee. No employer, no industry; no employee, no industry-not as a dogmatic proposition in
economics but as an articulate major premise of the definition and the schema of the Act, and as a
necessary postulate of industrial disputes and statutory resolution thereof.

An industry is not a futility but geared to utilities in which the community has concern. And in this
mundane world where law lives, now, economic utilities-material goods and services, not
transcendental flights nor intangible achievements-are the functional focus of industry. Therefore,
no temporal utilities, no, statutory industry, is axiomatic. If society, in its advance, experiences
subtler realities and assigns values to them, jurisprudence may reach out to such collective good.
Today, not tomorrow, is the first charge of pragmatic law of western heritage. So we are confined to
material, not ethereal end products. This much flows from a plain reading of the purpose and
proviSion of the legislation and its western origin and the ratio of all the rulings. We hold these
triple ingredients to be unexceptionable.

The relevant constitutional entry speaks of industrial and labour disputes (Entry 22 List I Sch. VII).
The Preamble to the Act refers to 'the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes’. The
definition of industry has to be decoded in this background and our holding is reinforced-by the fact
that industrial peace, collective bargaining, strikes and lock-outs, industrial adjudications, works
committees of employers and employees and the like connote organised, systematic operations and
collectivity of workmen co-operating with their employer in producing goods and services for the
community. The betterment of the workmen's lot, the avoidance of out-breaks blocking pro
duction and just and speedy settlement of disputes concern the community. In trade and business,
goods and services are for the community not for self-consumption. The penumbral area arrives as
we move on to the other essentials needed to make an organized, systematic activity, oriented ,on
productive collaboration between employer and employee, an industry as defined in Section 2(j).
Here we have to be cautious not to fall into the trap of definitional expansionism bordering on
reducio ad absurdum nor to truncate the obvious amplitude of the provision to fit it into our mental
would of beliefs and prejudices or social philosophy conditioned by class interests. Subjective wish
shall not be father to the forensic thought, if credibility with a pluralist community is a value to be
cherished. "Courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative
bodies". [See (Constitution of the United States of America) Corwin p. xxxi]. Even so, this legislation
has something to do with social justice between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots, and naive, fugitive
and illogical cut-backs on the import of 'industry’ may do injustice to the benignant enactment.
Avoiding Scylla and Charybdis we proceed to decipher the fuller import of the definition. To sum up,
the personality of the whole statute, be it remembered, has a welfare basis, it being a beneficial
legislation which protects Labour, promotes their contentment and regulates situations of crisis and
tension where production may be imperiled by untenable strikes and blackmail lock-outs. The
mechanism of the Act is geared to conferment of regulated benefits to workmen and resolution,
according to a sympathetic rule of law, of the conflicts, actual or potential, between managements
and workmen. Its goal is amelioration of the conditions of workers, tempered by a practical sense of
peaceful co-existence, to the benefit of both-not a neutral position but restraints on laissez faire and
concern for the welfare of the weaker lot. Empathy with the statute is necessary to understand not
merely its spirit but also its sense. One of the vital concepts on which the whole statute is built, is
‘industry’ and when we approach the definition in Section 2 (j), we must be informed by these
values. This certainly does not mean that we should strain the language of the definition to import
into it what we regard as desirable in an industrial legislation, for we are not legislating de novo butconstruing an existing Act. Crusading for a new type of legislation with dynamic ideas or humanist
justice and industrial harmony cannot be under the umbrella of interpreting an old, imperfect
enactment. Nevertheless, statutory diction speaks for today and tomorrow; words are semantic
seeds to serve the future hour. Moreover, as earlier highlighted, it is legitimate to project the
value-set of the Constitution, especially Part IV, in reading the meaning of even a pre-Constitution
statute. The paramount law is paramount and Part TV sets out Directive Principles of State Policy
which must guide the judiciary, like other instrumentalities, in interpreting all legislation. Statutory
construction is not a petrified process and the old bottle may, to the extent language and realism
permit be filled with new wine. Of course, the bottle should not break or lose shape.

Lord Denning has stated the judges task in reading the meaning of’ enactments:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 22Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

"The English language is not an instrument of mathematical precision. Our literature
would be much poorer if it were He must set to work in the constructive task of
finding the intention of Parliament and he must do this not only from the language of

it and of the mischief which it was passed to remedy , and then he must supplement
the written word so as to give 'force and life to the intention of the

creases." The duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature has used;

to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited."

The Industrial Disputes-Malhotra, Vol. 1 pp.

44 & 45) We may start the discussion with the leading case on the point, which perhaps may be
treated as the mariner's compass for judicial navigation B. N. Banerji v. R. P. Mukherjee & Others
(1954) S.C.R. 302)But before setting sail. let us map out briefly the range of dispute around the
definition. 'Lord Denning in Automobile Proprietary Ltd. observed :
"It is true that 'the industry’ is defined; but a definition is not to be read in isolation.
It must be read in the context of the phrase which it defines, realising that the
function of a definition is to give precision and certainty to a word or phrase which
would otherwise be vague and uncertain- but not to contradict it or supplant it
altogether."

Hotel and Catering Industry Training Board v. Automobile Proprietary Ltd. (1968) 1
W.L.R. 1526 at 1530.

A definition is ordinarily the crystallisation of a legal concept promoting precision and rounding off
blurred edges but, alas, the definition in S- 2(j), viewed in retrospect, has achieved the opposite.
Even so, we must try to clarify. Sometimes active interrogatories tell better than bland affirmatives
and so marginal omissions notwithstanding, we will string the points together in a few questions on
which we have been addressed.

A cynical jurist surveying the forensic scene may make unhappy comments. Counsel for the
respondent Unions sounded that note. A pluralist society with a capitalist backbone,
notwithstanding the innocuous adjective ‘socialist’ added to the Republic by the Constitution (42nd
Amendment Act, 1976) regards profit-making as a sacrosanct value. Elitist professionalism and
industrialism is sensitive to the 'worker' menace and inclines to exclude such sound and fury as
‘labour unrest' from its sanctified precincts by judicially de-industrialising the activities of
professional men and interest groups to the extent feasible. Governments in a mixed economy, share
some of the habits of thought of the dominant class and doctrines like sovereign functions, which

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 23Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

pull out economic enterprises run by them, come in handy. The latent love for club life and
charitable devices and escapist institutions bred by clever capitalism and hierarchical social
structure, shows up as inhibitions transmuted as doctrines, interpretatively carving out immunities
from the 'industrial' demands of labour by labelling many enterprises 'non-industries'. Universities,
clubs, institutes, manufactories and establishments managed by eleemosynary or holy entities, are
instances. To, objectify doctrinally subjective consternation is casuistry. A counter-critic, on the
other hand, may acidly contend that if judicial interpretation, uninformed by life's realities, were to
go wild, every home will be, not a quiet castle but tumultuous industry, every research unit will
grind to; a halt, every god will face new demands, every service club will be tile venue of rumble and
every charity choked off by brewing unrest and the salt of the earth as well as the lowliest and the
lost will suffer. Counsel for the appellants struck this pessimistic note. Is it not obvious from these
rival thought ways that law is valued loaded that social philosophy is an inarticulate interpretative
tool ? This is inescapable in any school of jurisprudence. Now let us itemise, illustratively, the posers
springing from the competing Submissions, so that the contentions may be concretised.

1. (a)Are establishments, run without profit motive. industries ?
(b) Are Charitable institutions industries ?

(c) Do undertakings governed by a no-profit- no-loss rule. statutorily or otherwise fastened, fall
within the definition in Sec. 2(j) ?

(d) Do, clubs or other organisations (like the Y.M.C.A.) whose general emphasis is not on
profit-making but fellowship and self-service, fit into the definitional circle ?

(e) To go to the core of the matter, is it an inalienable ingredient of ‘industry’ that it should be plied
with a commercial object ?

2. (a) Should co-operation between employer and employee be direct in so far as it relates to the
basic service or essential manufacture which is the output of the undertaking ?

(b) Could a lawyer's chambers or chartered accountant's office, a doctor's clinic or other liberal
profession's occupation or calling be designated an industry ?

(c) Would a University or college or school or research institute be called an industry ?

3. (a)Is the inclusive part of the definition in Sec. 2(j) relevant to the determination of an industry ?
If so, what impact does it make on the categories ?

(b) Do domestic service drudges who slave without respite-become ‘industries’ by this extended
sense ?

4. Are governmental functions, stricto sensu, industrial and if not, what is the extent of the
immunity of instrumentalities of government ?

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 24Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

5. What rational criterion exists for a cut-back on the dynamic potential and semantic sweep of the
definition, implicit in the industrial law of a progressive society geared to greater industrialisation
and consequent concern for regulating relations and investigating disputes between employers and
employees as industrial processes and rela- tions become more complex and sophisticated and
workmen become more right-conscious?

6. As the provision now stands, is it scientific to define ‘industry’ based on the nature-the dominant
nature of the activity, i.e. on the terms of the work, remuneration and conditions of service which
bond the-two wings together into an employer-employee complex ?

Back to Banerji, to begin at the very beginning. Technically, this Bench that hears the appeals now is
not bound by any of the earlier decisions. But we cannot agree with Justice Roberts of the U. S.
Supreme Court that 'adjudications of the court were rapidly gravitating into the same class as a
restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only' (See Corwin XVII). The present- even the
revolutionary present-does not break wholly with the past but breaks bread with it, without being
swallowed by it and may eventually ,,wallow it. While it is true, academically speaking, that the court
should be ultimately right rather than consistently wrong, the social interest in the certainty of the,
law is a value which urges continuity where possible, clarification where sufficient and correction
where derailment, misdirection or fundamental flaw defeats the statute or creates considerable
industrial confusion. Shri M. K. Ramamurthy, encored by Shri R. K. Garg, argued emphatically that
after Safdarjung, the law is in trauma and so a fresh look at the problem is ripe. The learned
Attorney General and Shri Tarkunde, who argued at effective, illuminating length, as well as Dr.
Singhvi and Shri A. K. Sen who briefly and tellingly supplemented, did not hide the fact that the law
is in Queer Street but sought to discern a golden thread of sound principle which could explain the
core of the rulings which peripherally had contradictory thinking. In this situation, it is not wise, in
our view, to reject everything ruled till date and fabricate new tests, armed with lexical wisdom or
reinforced by vintage judicial thought from Australia. Banerji we take as good, and anchored on its
authority, we will examine later decisions to stabilize the law on the firm principles gatherable
therefrom, rejecting erratic excursions. To sip every flower and change every hour is not realism but
romance which must not enchant the court. Indeed, Sri Justice Chandrasekhara Iyer, speaking for a
unanimous Bench, has sketched the guidelines perceptively, if we may say so respectfully. Later
cases have only added their glosses, not overruled it and the fertile source of conflict has been the
bashyams rather than the basic decision. Therefore, our task is not to supplant the ratio of Banerji
but to straighten and strengthen it in its application, away from different deviations and aberrations.

Banerji. The Budge Budge Municipality dismissed two employees whose dispute was sponsored by
the Union. The award of the Industrial Tribunal directed reinstatement but the Municipality
challenged the award before the High Court and this Court on the fundamental ground that a
municipality in discharging its normal duties connected with local self- government is not engaged
in any industry as defined in the Act.

A panoramic view of the statute and its jurisprudential bearings has been projected there and the
essentials of an industry decocted. The definitions of employer (Sec. 2(g), industry [See. 2(j),

industrial dispute [Sec. 2(k)] workman [Sec. 2(a)], are a statutory dictionary, not popular parlance.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 25Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

It is plain that merely because tie, employer is a government department or a local body (and, a
fortiori, a statutory board, society or like entity the enterprise does not cease to be an ‘industry’.
Likewise, what the common man does not consider as 'industry' need not necessarily stand excluded
from the statutory concept. (And vice versa.) The latter is deliberately drawn wider, and in some
respects narrower, as Chandrasekhara, Aiyer, J., has emphatically expressed:

"In the ordinary or non-technical sense, according to what is understood by the man
in the street, industry or business means as undertaking where capital and labour cooperate with each other for the purpose of producing wealth in the shape of goods,
machines, tools etc., and for making profits. The concept of industry in this ordinary
sense applied even to a culture, horticulture, pisciculture and so on and so forth. It is
also clear that every aspect of activity in which the relationship of employer and em
ployee exists or arises does not thereby become an industry as commonly understood. We hardly
think in terms of an industry, when we have regard, for instance, to the rights and duties of master
and servant, or of a Government and its secretariat, or the members of the medical profession
Working in a hospital. It would be regarded as absurd to think. so; at any rate the layman
unacquainted with advancIng legal concepts of what is meant by industry would rule out such a
connotation as impossible. There is nothing however to prevent a statute from giving the word
"industry" and the words "industrial dispute" a wider and more comprehensive import in order to
meet the requirements of rapid industrial progress and to bring about in the interests of industrial
peace and economy, a fair and satisfactory adjustment of relations between employers and workmen
in a variety of fields of activity. It is obvious that the limited concept of what an industry meant in
early times, must now yield place to an enormously wider concept so as to. take in various and
varied forms of industry, so that dispute arising in connection with them might be settled quickly
without much dislocation and disorganisation of the needs of society and in a manner more adapted
to conciliation and settlement than a determination of the respective rights and liabilities according
to strict legal procedure and principles. The conflicts between capital and labour have now to be
determined more from the standpoint of status than of contract. Without such an approach, the
numerous problems that now arise for solution in the shape of industrial disputes cannot be tackled
satisfactorily and this is why every civilised government has thought of the machinery of conciliation
officers, Boards and Tribunals for the effective settlement of dispute." (emphasis added) The
dynamics of industrial law, even if incongruous with popular understanding, is this first proposition
we derive from Banerji :

"Legislation had to keep pace with the march of times and to provide for new
situations. Social evolution is a process of constant growth, and the State cannot
afford to standstill without taking adequate measure by means of legislation to solve
large and momentous problems that arise in the industrial field from day to day
almost."

The second,, though trite, guidance that we get is that we should not be beguiled by similar words in
dissimilar statutes, contexts, subject-matters or socioeconomic situations. The same words may

mean one thing in one context and another in a different context. This is the reason why decisions

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 26Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

on the meaning of particular words or collection of words found in other statutes are scarcely of
much value when we have to deal with a specific statute of our own; they may persuade, but cannot
pressure. We would only add that a developing country is anxious to preserve the smooth flow of
goods and services, and interdict undue exploitation and, towards those ends labour legislation is
enacted and must receive liberal construction to fulfil its role.

Let us get down to the actual amplitude and circumscription of the statutory concept of industry’.
Not a narrow but an enlarged acceptation is intended; This is supported by several considerations.

Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J. observes 16-211SCI/78 "Do the definitions of industry industrial dispute
and 'workman' taken in teh extended significance or exclude it? Though the word undertaking in the
definition of industry- is wedged in between business and trade on the one hand and manufacture
on the other and though therefore it might mean only a business or trade undertaking, still it must
be remembered that if that were so there was no need to use the word separately from business or
trade. The wider export is attracted even more clearly when we look at the latter part of the
definition which refers to Calling, service, employment or industrial occupation of avocation of
workmen”.

"Undertaking" in the first part of the definition and ‘industrial occupation or avocation in the second
part obviously mean much more than what is ordinarily understood by trade or business. The
definition was apparently intended to ‘include within its scope what might not strictly be called a
trade or business venture."

So ‘industry’ overflows trade and business. Capital, ordi- narily assumed to be a component of
‘industry’, is an expendable item so far as statutory 'industry' is concerned. To reach this conclusion,
the Court referred to ‘public utility service’ Sec. 2(n) and argued "A public utility service such as
railways, telephones and the supply of power, light or water,to the public may be carried on. by
private companies or business corporations. Even conservancy or sanitation may be so carried on,
though after the introduction of local self-government this 'work has in almost every country been
assigned as a duty to local bodies like our Municipalities or District Boards or Local Boards. A
dispute in thes e services between employers and workmen is an industrial dispute, and the proviso
to section 10 lays down that where such a dispute arises and a notice under section 22 has been
given, the appropriate Government shall make a reference under the sub-section. If the public utility
service is carried on by a corporation like a Municipality which is the creature of a state, and which
functions under the limitations imposed by the statute, does it cease to be an industry for this reason
? The only ground on which one could say that what would amount to the carrying on of an industry
if it is done by a private person ceases to be so if the same work, is carried on by a local body like a
Municipality is that in the letter there is nothing like the investment of any capital or the existence of
a profit earning motive as there generally is in a business. But neither the one nor the other seems a
sine qua non or necessary element In the modern conception of industry ? ,(emphasis added)
Absence of capital does not negative 'industry. Nay, even charitable services do not necessarily cease
to be ‘industries definitionally although popularly charity is not industry. Interestingly, the Learned
Judge dealt with the point. After enumerating typical municipal activities he concluded "Some of
these functions may appertain to and prtake of the nature of an industry , while others may not. For

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 27Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

instance, there is a necessary element of distinction between the supply of power and light to the
inhabitants of a Municipality and the running of charitable hospitals and dispensaies for the aid of
the poor. In ordinary parlance, the former might be regarded as an industry but not the latter. The
very idea underlying the entrustment of such duties or functions to local bodies is not to take them
out of the sphere of industry but to secure the substitution of public authorities in the place of
private employers and to eliminate the motive of profit-making as far as possible. the levy of taxes
for the maintenance of the services of sanitation and the conservancy or the supply of light and
water is a method adopted and devised to make up for the absence of capital. The undertaking or the
service will still remain with the ambit of what we understand by an industry though it is carried on
with the aid of taxation, and no immediate material gain by way of profit is envisaged." (emphasis
added) The contention that charitable undertakings are not industries is, by this token, untenable.
Another argument pertinent to our discussion is the sweep of the expression 'trade. The Court
refers, with approval, to in-Bolton Corporation (143 A.C. 166) where the Law Lord observed :

"Indeed ‘trade’ is not only in the etymological or dictionary sense, but in the legal
usage, a term of the widest scope. It is connected originally with the word 'tread' and
indicates a way of life or an occupation.

In ordinary usage it may mean the occupation of a small shopkeeper equally with that of a
commercial magnate. It may also mean a skilled craft. It is true that it is often used in contrast with
a profession. A professional worker would not ordinarily be called a tradesman, but the word 'trade'
is used in the widest application to the appellation 'trade unions’. Professions have their trade
unions. It is also used in the Trade Boards Act to include industrial undertakings. I see no reason to
exclude from the operation of the Industrial Courts Act the activities of local authorities, even
without taking into account the fact that these authorities now carry on portent industrial
undertakings. The order expressly its definition section that 'trade or performance of, its functions
by a It is true that these words are used in Part III, which deals with 'recognized terms and
conditions of employment, and in Part TV, which deals with 'departures from trade. practices’ in
‘any industry or undertaking’ and not in Part 1, which deals with 'national arbitration’ and is the part
material in this case, but I take them as illustrating what modern conditions involve-the idea that
the functions of local authorities may come under the expression ‘trade or industry’. I think the
same may be said of the Industrial Courts Act and of Reg. 58-AA, in both of which the word 'trade' is
used in the very wide connotation which it bears in the modern legislation dealing with conditions of
employment, particularly in relation to matters of collective bargaining and the like". (emphasis
added) In short, trade' embraces functions of local authorities, even professions, thus departing
from popular notions. Another facet of the controversy is next touched upon-i.e. profit-making
motive is not a sine quo non of ‘industry’ functionally or definitionally. For this, Powers J, in
Federated Municipal and Shire Employees’ Union of Australia v. Melbourne Corporation(1) was
quoted with emphatic approval where the Australian High Court considered an industrial legislation
"So far as the question in this case is concerned, as the argument proceeded the ground mostly
relied upon (after the Councils were held not to be exempt as State instru- mentalities) was that the
work was not carried on by the municipal corporations for profit in the ordinary sense of the term,
although it would generally speaking be carried on by the Councils themselves to save contractors’
profits. It that argument were sufficient, then a philanthropist who acquired a clothing factory and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 28Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

employed the same employees as the previous owner had employed would not be engaged in an
occupation about which an industrial dispute could arise, if he distributed the clothes made to the
poor free of charge or even if he distributed them to the poor at the bare cost of production. If the
contention of the respondent is correct, a private company carrying on a ferry would be engaged in
an industrial occupation. If a municipal corporation carried it on, it would not be industrial. The
same argument would apply to baths, bridge-building, quarries, sanitary contracts, gas-making for
lighting streets and public halls, municipal building of houses or halls, I and many other similar
industrial undertakings. Even coalmining for use on municipal railways or tramways would not be
industrial work if the contention of the respondents is correct. If the works in question are carried
out by contractors or by private individuals it is said to be industrial, but not industrial within the
meaning of the Arbitration Act or Constitution if carried out by municipal corporations. I cannot
accept that view". (emphasis added) The negation of profit motive, as a telling test against 'Industry
is clear from this quote.

(1) 26 C.L.R. 508.

All the indicia of 'industry' are packed into the judgment which condenses the conclusion tersely to
hold that ‘industries' will cover 'branches of work that can be said to be analogous to the carrying out
of a trade or business’. The case, read as a whole, contributes to industrial jurisprudence, with
special reference to the Act, a few positive facets and knocks down a few negative fixations.
Governments and municipal and statutory bodies may run enterprises which do not for that reason
cease to be industries. Charitable activities may also be industries. Undertakings, sans profit motive,
may well be industries. Professions and not ipso facto out of the pale of in- dustries. Any operation
carried on in a manner analogous to trade or business may legitimately be statutory ‘industry. The
popular limitations on the concept of industry do not amputate the ambit of legislative generosity in
Sec.2(j). Industrial peace and the smooth supply to the community are among the aims and objects
the Legislature had in view, as also the nature, variety range and areas of disputes between
employers and employees. These factors must inform the construction of the provision.

The limiting role of Banerji must also be noticed so that a total view is gained. For instance,
‘analogous to trade or business' cuts ,down ‘undertaking, a word of fantastic sweep. Spiritual
undertakings, casual undertakings, domestic undertakings, war waging, policing, justicing,
legislating, tax collecting and the like are, prima facie, pushed out. Wars are not merchantable, nor
justice, saleable, nor divine grace marketable. So, the problem shifts to what Is ‘analogous to trade
or business’. As we proceed to the next set of cases. we come upon the annotation of other
expressions like 'calling' and get to grips with the specific organisations which call for identification
in the several appeals before us. At this stage, a close-up of the content and contours of the
controversial words ‘analogous etc., which have consumed considerable time of counsel, may be
taken. To be fair to Banerji. With the path finding decision which conditioned and canalised and
fertilised subsequent juristic-humanistic ideation, we must show fidelity to the terminological
exactitude of the seminal expression used and search care- fully for its import. The prescient words
are : branches of work that can be said to be analogous to the carrying out of a 'trade or business’.
The same judgment has negatived the necessity for profit-motive and included charity impliedly,
has virtually equated private sector and public sector operations and has even perilously hinted at

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 29Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

‘professions’ being 'trade?.- In this perspective, the comprehensive reach of 'analogous' activities
must be measured. The similarity stressed relates to 'branches of work'; and more; the analogy with
trade or business is in the ‘carrying out' of the economic adventure. So, the parity is in the modus
operandi, in the working-not in the purpose of the project nor in the disposal of the proceeds but in
the Organisation of the venture, including the relations between the two limbs viz. labour and
management. If the mutual relations, the 2 38 method of employment and the process of
co-operation in the carrying out of the work bear close resemblance to the organization method
remuneration, relationship of employer and employee and the like then it is industry otherwise not.
This is the kernel of the decision. An activity oriented,but motive based, analysis.

The landmark Australian case in 26 C.I.R. 508 (Melbourne Corporation) which was heavily relied on
in Banerji may engage us, That ruling contains dicta, early in the century, which make Indian
forensic fabianism sixty years after in the 'socialist’ Republic blush That apart the discussion in the
leading judgments dealing with industry from a constitutional angle but relying on statute similar to
ours is instructive For instance, consider the promptings of profit as a condition o industry. higgins
j. crushes that credo thus: "The purpose of profit-making can hardly be the criterion. If it were the
labourers who excavated the underground passage for the Duke of Portland's whim, or the labourers
who build (for pay) a tower of Babel or a pyramind, could not beparties to an ‘industrial dispute’.
The worker-oriented perspective is underscored by Isaacs and Rich JJ. It is at the same time as is
perceived, contended on the part of labour, that matters even indirectly prejudicially affecting the
,Workers are, within the sphere of dispute. For, instance, at P. 70 (par. 175(4) (a), one of the
competing contentions is thus stated, : "Long, hours proceed from the competition of employer with
employer in the same trade Employers ought to be prevented from competing in this way at the
expense. of. their workmen." (emphasis added) As a fact, in a later year, Lord lamps of Hereford, in
an award, held that one employer in a certain trade must confirm to the the practice, of others. What
must be borne,, steadily in mind, as evidenced by the nature of the claims made, is that the about of
obtaining a large share of the product of the industry and, of exercising, a voice as to the, general
conditions under which it shall be carried on (par. 100) covers all means direct and incidental
without which the main object cannot be fully or effectively attained. Some of these will be
particularized but in the meantime it should be said that they will, show in them solves, and from
the' character of the disputants this will be confirmed, that so long as the operations are of capital
and labour in co-operation for the satisfaction of material human needs, the objects and demands of
labour are the same, whether the result of the operations be money or money's worth. The inevitable
concern, as it seems to us, from this is that in 1 894 it was well, understood that "trade disputes",
which at one time had a limited scope of action, without altering their inherent and essential nature,
so developed as to be- recognised better under the name of "industrial disputes’ 'or' "labour
disputes," and to. be more and more founded on the practical view that human labour was not a
more asset of capital but was a cooperating agency of equal dignity a working partner-and entitled to
consideration as such". The same two judge choose to impart a wide construction to the word
‘industry for they ask :'How can we conformably to recog
nized rules of legal construction, attempt to limit, in an instrument of self-government for this
Continent, the simple and comprehensive words "industrial disputes" by any apprehension of what

we might imagine would be theeffect of a full liter construction, or by conjecturing what was in the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 30Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

minds of the framers of the constitution, or by the forms industrial disputes have, more recently
assumed? "Industrial warfare", is no mere figure of speech. It is not the mere phrase, of theorists. It
is recognized by the law as the, correct description of internal conflicts in industrial matters. It was
adopted by Lord Loreburn L.C. in Conway v. Wade (A) (1909) A.C., at p511. Strikes and, lock- outs
are, by him, correctly described as "weapons".' These arguments hold good for the Indian industrial
statute, and so, Sec. 2(j) must receive comprehensive literal force, limited only by some cardinal
criteria. One such criterion, in the monarchical vocabulary of English Jurisprudence, is Crown
exemption, reincarnating in a Republic as inalienable functions of constitutional government. No
government no order; no order; no law no rule of law ,no industrial relations. So core functions of
the State are paramount and paramountcy is paramountcy. but this doctrinal exemption is not
expansionist but strictly narrowed of necessitous functions. Isaacs and Rich JJ. dwell on this topic
and after quoting Lord Watson's test of inalienable functions of a Constitutional government state:
"Here we have the discrimen of Crown exemption. If a municipality either [(1997) 1 Q,B. at pp.
70-71] is, legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever the Crown, or
(1997) 1Q.B., at p. 71 is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which
constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function as, for instance the administration of justice the
municipality is in law, presumed to represent the Crown and the exemption applies, Otherwise, it is
outside that exemption, and if impliedly exempted at all, some other principle must be re- sorted to.
The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition". (Italics
supplied).

Now, the cornerstone of industrial law is well laid by Bannerji, supported by Lord Mayor of the, City
of Melbourne, A chronological survey of post-Banerji. decisions of this Court, with, accent on the
juristic contributions registered by them, may be methodical Thereafter, cases in alien jurisdictions
and derivation of guidelines may be attempted, Even here, we may warn ourselves that the literal
latitude of the words in the. definition cannot In allowed grotesquely inflationary play but must be
read down to accord with the broad industrial sense of the nation’s economic community of which
Labour is an, integral part. To bend beyond, credible limits is to break with facts unless language
leaves no, option. Forensic inflation of the sense of words shall not lead to an adaptational
break-down out- raging the good sense of even radical realists. After all, the Act has been drawn on
an industrial canvas to solve the problems of industry, not of chemistry. A functional focus and
social, control desideratum must be in the mind's eye of the judge.

The two landmark cases, The Corporation of the City of. Nag- pur v. Its Employees(1) and State of
Bombay and Others v. The Hospital Mazdoor Sabha & Ors.(2) may now be analysed in the light of
what we have just said. Filling the gaps in the Banerji decision and the authoritative connotation of
the fluid phrase ‘analogous to trade and business' were attempted in this twin decisions. To be
analogous is to resemble in functions relevant, to the subject, as between like features of two
apparently different things. So, some kinship through resemblance to trade or business, is the key to
the problem, if Banerji is the guide star. Partial similarity postulates selectivity of characteristics for
comparability. Wherein lies the analogy to trade or business, is then the query.

Sri Justice Subba Rao, with uninhibited logic, chases this thought and reaches certain tests in
Nagpur Municipality, speaking for a unanimous Bench. We respectfully agree with much of his

reasoning and proceed to deal with the decision. If the ruling, were right, as we think it is, the riddle
of 'industry' is resolved in some measure. Although foreign decisions, words and phrases, lexical
plenty. and definitions from other legislations, were read before us to stress the necessity of direct
co-operation between employer and employees in the essential product of the undertaking, of the
need for the. commercial motive, of service to the community etc., as implied, inarticulately in the
concept of 'industry', we bypass them as but marginally persuasive. The rulings of this Court, the
language and scheme of the Act and the well-known canons of construction exert real pressure on
our judgment. And, in this latter process, next to Banerji comes Corporation of Nagpur which
spreads the canvas wide and illumines the expression ‘analogous to trade or business’, although it
comes a few days after Hospital Mazdoor Sabha decided by the same Bench.

To be sure of our approach on a wider basis let us cast a glance at internationally recognised
concepts vis-a-vis industry. The International Labour Organisation has had occasion to consider,
freedom of association for labour as a primary right and collective bargaining followed by strikes, if
necessary, as a derivative right. The question has arisen as to whether public servants employed in
the crucial functions of the government fall outside the orbit of industrial conflict. Convention No.
98 concerning the Application of the Principles of the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively,
in Article 6 states "This Convention does not deal with the position of Public servants engaged in the
administration of the State, nor shall it be construed as prejudicing their' rights or status in any

"

way.
(1) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 942.
(2) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 866.

Thus, it is well-recognised that public servants in the key sectors of Administration stand out of the
industrial sector. The Committee ,of Experts of the ILO had something to say about the carving out
of the public servants from the general category.

Incidentally, it may be useful to note certain clear statements made by ILO on the concept of
industry, workmen and industrial dispute, not with clear-cut legal precision but with sufficient
particularity for general purposes although looked at from a different angle. We quote from
'Freedom of Association’, Second edition, 1976, which is a digest of decisions of the Freedom of
Association Committee of the Governing Body of the ILO:

"2. Civil servants and other workers in the employ of the State.

250. Convention No. 98, and in particular Article 4 thereof concerning the
encouragement and promotion of collective bargaining, applies both to the private
sector and to nationalised undertakings and public bodies, it being possible to
exclude from such application public servants engaged in the administration of the
State.

251. Convention No. 98, which mainly concerns collective bargaining, permits
(Article 6) the exclusion of "public servants engaged in the administration of the
State". In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of
Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that, while the concept of public
servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the
exclusion from the scope of the Convention of persons employed by the State or in
the public sector, who do not act as agents of the public authority (even though they
may be granted a status identical with that of public officials ,engaged in the
administration of the State) is contrary to the meaning of the Convention. The
distinction to be, drawn, accordingly to the Committee, would appear to be basically
between civil servants employed in various capacities in government ministries or
comparable bodies on the' one hand and other persons employed by the government,
by public undertakings or by independent public corpora- tions.

This divagation was calculated only to emphasise certain fundamentals in international industrial
thinking which accord with a wider conceptual acceptation for 'industry'. The wings of the 'industry'
have been spread wide in section 2(j) and brought out in the decision in Corporation case 'was
concerned with a dispute between a employees. The major issue considered there the much disputed
expression analogous to the carrying on of a trade or business". Municipal undertakings ‘are
ordinarily industries as Baroda Borough Municiapality(1) held. Even so the scope of ‘industry’ was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 33Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

investigated by the Bench in the City of Nagpur which affirmed Banerji and Baroda. The Court took
the viewthat the words used in the definition were prima facie of the widest import and declined to
curtail, the width of meaning by invocation of noscitur a sociis. Even so, the Court was disinclined of
spread the not too wide by expanding the elastic expressions calling, service employment and
handicraft. To 'be 'over-inclusive may be impractical and so while accepting the enlargement of
meaning by the device' of inclusive definition the Court cautioned "But such a wide meaning appears
to over-reach the objects for which the Act was passed. It is, therefore, necessary to limit its scope on
permissible grounds, having regard to the aim, scope and the, object of the whole Act."

After referring to the rule in Heydon's case, Subba Rao, J. proceeded to outline the ambit of industry
thus "The word 'employers' in cl. (c) and the word employees’ in cl. (b) indicate that the
fundamental basis for the application, of the definition is the existence of,. that (1) [1957] S,C.R. 33.

relationship. The cognate definitions of ‘industrial dispute Act as well as its preamble show that the
Act was passed to ‘employer, ' employee’, also support. The long title of the make provision for the
promotion of industries and peaceful and amicable settlement of disputes between employers and
employees in an organised activity by conciliation and arbitration and for certain other purposes. If
the preamble is read, with the, historical background for the passing of the Act, it is manifest that
the ACt was introduced as an important step in achieving social justice. The Act seeks to ameliorate
the service conditions of the workers to provide a machinery for resolving their conflicts and to
encourage co
operative effort in the service of the community. The history of labour legislation both in England
and India also shows that it was aimed more of ameliorate the conditions of service of the labour in
organised activities than to any thing else. The act was not intended to reach the personal service
which do not depend upon the employment of a labour force.

Whether the exclusion of personal services is warranted may be examined a little later.

The, Court proceeded to carve out the negative factor& which, notwithstanding the literal width of
the language of the definition, must, for other competing reasons, be kept out of the scope of
industry For instance, sovereign functions of the State cannot be included although what such
functions are has been aptly termed ‘the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional
government’. Even here we may point out the inaptitude of, relying on the doctrine of regal powers,
That has reference in this context to, the Crown's liability in tort and has nothing to do with
Industrial Law, In any case it is open to Parliament to make law which governs the State's relations
with its employees. Articles 309 to, 311 of the Constitution of India, the enactments dealing with the
defence Forces and other legislation dealing with employment under statutory bodies may,
expressly or by necessary implication, exclude the operation of the Industrial. Disputes Act, 1947.
That is a question of interpretation and statutory exclusion; but, in the absence of such provision of
law, it may indubitably be assumed that the key aspects of public administration like public justice.
stand out of the circle of industry . Even 'here, as has been brought out from the excerpts of ILO
documents, it is not every employee- who is excluded but only 'Certain categories primarily engaged
and supportively employed in the discharge of, the essential functions of constitutional government.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 34Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

In a limited way, this head of exclusion has been recognised throughout. Although we are not
concerned in this case with those, categories of employees who particularly come under
departments charged with the responsibility for essential constitutional functions of government, it
is appropriate to state that if there are industrial units severable from the essential functions and
possess an entity of their own it may be plausible to hold that the employees of those units are
workmen 244.

and those undertakings are industries. A blanket exclusion of every one of the host of employees
engaged by government in departmental falling under general rubrics like, justice, defence, taxation,
legislature, may not necessarily be thrown out of the umbrella of the Act. We say no more except to
observe that closer exploration, not summary rejection, is necessary.

The Court proceeded, in the Corporation of Nagpur case, to pose for itself the import of the words
‘analogous to the carrying out of a trade or business' and took the view that the emphasis was more
on to equate the other activities with trade or business’. Obviously, non-trade operations were in
many cases ‘industry’. Relying on the Fabricated Engine Drivers(1) Subba Rao, J., observed :

"It is manifest from this decision that even activities of a municipality which cannot
be described as trading activities can be the subject-matter of an industrial disputes."

The true test, according to the Learned Judge, was concisely expressed by Isaacs J., in his dissenting
judgment in the Federated State School Teachers’ Association of Australia v. State of Victoria.(2)
"The material question is : What is the nature of , the actual function assumed-is it a service that the
State could have left to private enterprise, and, if so, fulfilled, could such a dispute be ‘industrial’ ?”.

Thus the nature of actual function and of the pattern of organised ,activity is decisive. We will revert
to this aspect a little later.

It is useful to remember that the Court rejected the test attempted by counsel in the case :

"It is said that unless there is a quid pro quo for the service it cannot be an industry.
This is the same argument, namely, that the service must be in the nature of trade in
a different garb"

We agree with this observation and with the further observation that there is no merit in the plea
that unless the public who are benefited by the services pay in cash, the services so rendered cannot
be industry. Indeed, the signal service rendered by the Corporation of Nagpur is to dispel the idea of
profit-making. Relying on Australian cases which held that profit-making may be important from
the income tax point of view but irrelevant from an industrial dispute point of view, the Court
approved of a critical passage in the dissenting judgment of Isaacs J., in the School Teachers'
Association case (supra) :

"The contention sounds like an echo from the dark ages, of industry and political I
economy.......... Such disputes are not simply a claim to share the material

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 35Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

(1) (1913) 16 C.L.R. 245.

(2) (1929) 41 C.L.R. 569.

‘Monetary considerations for service is, therefore,. not essential Characteristic of industry in a
modern State."

Even according to the traditional concepts of English Law, profit has to be disregarded when
ascertaining whether an enterprise is a business :

"3. Disregard of Profit. Profit or the intention to make profit is not an essential part of the legal
definition of a trade or business; and payment or profit does not constitute a trade or business that
which would not otherwise be such”.

(Halsbury's Laws of England, Third Edition, Vol. 38, p. 11).

Does the badge of industrialism, broadly understood, banish, from its fold, education ? , This
question needs fuller consideration, as it has been raised in this batch of appeals and has been
answered in favour of employers by this Court in the Delhi University case.(1) But since Subba Rao,
J., has supportively cited Isaacs J. in School Teachers' Association (supra), which relates to the same
problem, we may, even here, prepare the ground by dilating on the subject with special reference to
the Australian case. That learned Judge expressed surprise at the very question :

"The basic question raised by this case, strange as it may seem, is whether the
occupation of employees engaged in education, itself universally recognized as the
key industry to all skilled occupations, is 'industrial' within the meaning of the
Constitution”.

The employers argued that it was fallacious to spin out 'industry' from 'education' and the logic was
a specious economic doctrine. Issacs J., with unsparing sting and in fighting mood, stated and
refuted the plea :

"The theory was that society is industrially organised for the,production and
distribution of wealth in the sense of tangible, ponderable, corpuscular wealth, and
therefore an "industrial dispute" cannot possibly occur except where there is
furnished to the public- the consumers by the combined efforts of employers and
employed, wealth of that nature. Consequently, say the employers, "education" not
being "wealth" in that sense, there never can be an "industrial dispute” between
employers and employed engaged in the avocation of education, regardless of the
wealth derived by the employers from the joint co-operation.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 36Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

The contention sounds like an echo from the dark ages of industry and political
economy. It not merely ignores the constant currents of life around us, which is the
real danger in deciding questions of this nature, but it also forgets the memorable
industrial organization of the nations, not for the production or distribution, of
material wealth, but for ser
(1) [1964] 2 S.C.R. 703.

vices, national service as the service of organized industry must always be. Examination of this
contention will not only completely dissipate it, but will also serve to, throw material light on the
question in hand generally the contention is radically unsound for two great reasons. It erroneously
thereby unduly limits the meaning of the terms "production"

conceives the object of national industrial organization and "wealth when used in that connection.
But it further neglects the fundamental character of "industrial disputes" as a distinct and insistent
phenomenon of modern society. Such disputes are not simply a claim to share the material wealth
jointly produced and-capable of registration in statistics. At heart they are a struggle, constantly
becoming more intense on the part of the employed group engaged in cooperation with the
employing group in rendering services to the community essential for a higher general human
welfare, to share in that welfare in a greater degree................ That contention, if acceded to, would
be revolutionary........... How could it reasonably be said that a comic song or a jazz performance, or
the representation of comedy, or a ride in tramcar or motor-bus, piloting a ship, lighting aI or
showing a moving picture is more "material" as wealth instruction, ‘either cultural or vocational ?
Indeed, to take on.- instance, a workman who travels in a tramcar a mile from his home to his
factory is not more efficient for his daily task than if he walked ten yards, whereas his technical
training has a direct effect in increasing output. If music or acting or personal transportation is
admitted to be "industrial" because each is productive of wealth to the employer as his business
undertaking, then an educational establishment stands on the same footing. But if education is
excluded for the reason advanced, how are we to admit barbers, hairdressers, taxi-car drivers,
furniture re- movers, and other occupations that readily suggest themselves ? And yet the doctrine
would admit manufactures of intoxicants and producers of degrading literature and pic- tures,
because these tire considered to be "wealth"., The doctrine would concede, for instance, that
establishments for the training of performing dogs, or of monkeys simulating human behaviour,
would be "industrial," because one would have increased material wealth that is, a more valuable
dog or monkey, in the sense that one could exchange it for more money. If parrots are taught to say
"Pretty Polly" and to dance on their perch, that is, by concession, industrial, because it is the
production of wealth. But if Australian youths are trained to read and write their language correctly
and in other necessary elements of culture and vocation making them more efficient citizens, fitting
them with more or less directness to take their place in the general industrial ranks of the nation
and to render the services required by the community, that training is said not to be wealth and the
work done by teachers employed is said not to be industrial."

So long as services are part 'of 'the wealth of a nation-and it is obscurantist to object to
it-educational services are Wealth, are ‘industrial’. We agree with Isaacs J. More closely analysed,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 37Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

We may ask ourselves, as Isaacs J. did, whether, if private scholastic establishments 'carried 'on
reaching on the same lines as the State schools, giving elementary education free, and charging fees
for the higher subjects, providing the same curriculum and so on, by means of employed teachers,
would such dispute as we have here be an industrial dispute ?.................. I have already indicated
my view", says Isaacs J. "that education so provided constitutes in itself an independent industrial
operation as a Service rendered to the community. Charles Dickens evidently thought so When
ninety years ago Squeers called his school "the shop" and prided himself on Nickleby's being "cheap"
at pound 5 a year and commensurate living conditions. The world has not turned back since then. In
1926 the Committee on Industry and Trade in their report to the British Prime Minister, included
among "Trade Unions" those called "teaching." It there appears that in 1897 there were six unions
with a total membership of 45,319 and in 1924 there were seventeen unions with a membership of
1,94,946. The true position of education in relation to the actively operative trades is not really
doubtful. Education, cultural and vocational, is now and is daily becoming as much the artisan's
capital and tool, and to a great extent his safeguard against unemployment, as the employers'
banking credit and insurance policy are part of his means to carry on the business. There is at least
as much reason for including the educational establishments in the constitutional power as "labour"
services, as there is to include insurance companies as "capital" services." We have extensively
excerpted from the vigorous dissent because the same position holds good for India which AS
emerging from feudal illiteracy to industrial education. In Gandhi's India basic education and
handicraft merge and in the latter half of our century higher education involves field studies, factory
training, house surgeoncy and clini- cal education, and, sans such technological training and
education in humanities, industrial progress is self- condemned. If education and training are
integral to industrial and agricultural activities, such services are part of industry even if high
browism may be unhappy to acknowledge it. It is a class-conscious, inegalitarian outlook with an
elitist aloofness which makes some people shrink from we accepting educational institutions,
vocational or other as industries. The definition is wide, embraces training for industry which, in
truth, ensconces all processes of producing goods and services by employer- employee cooperation.
Education is the nidus of industrialization and Itself is industry. We may consider certain aspects of
this issue while dealing with later cases of our Court. Suffice it to say, the unmincing argument of
Isaacs J. has been specifically approved in Corporation on of Nagpur and Hospital Mazdoor Sabha
(supra) in a different aspect.

Now we revert to the more crucial part of Corporation of Nagpur. It is meaningful to notice that in
that case, the Court, in its incisive analysis, department by department of variform municipal
services, specifically observed :

"Education Department : This department looks after the primary education, 1.e.,
compulsory primary education within the limits of the Corporation. (See the evidence
of Witness No.

1). This service can equally be done by private persons. This department satisfies the

other tests. The employees of this department coming under the definition of
"employees" under the Act would certainly be entitled to the benefits of the Act."

The substantial break-through achieved by this decision in laying bare the fundamentals of
‘industry’ in its wider sense deserves mention. The ruling tests are clear. 1. The 'analogous' species of
quasitrade qualify for becoming 'industry' if the nature of the organized activity implicit in a trade or
business is shared by them. (See p. 960. the entire organisational activity). It is not necessary to
‘equate the other activities with trade or business’. The pith and substance of the matter is that the
structural, organisational engineering aspect, the crucial industrial relations like wages, leave and
other service conditions as well as characteristic business methods (not motives) in running the
enterprise, govern the conclusion. Presence of profit motive is expressly negated as a criterion. Even
the quid pro quo theory which is the same monetary object in a milder version-has been dismissed.
The subtle distinction, drawn in lovely lines and pressed with emphatic effect by Sri Tarkunde,
between gain and profit, between no profit no- loss basis having different results in the private and
public sectors, is fascinating but, in the rough and tumble, and sound and fury of industrial life, such
nuances break down and nice refinements defeat. For the same reason, we are disinclined to chase
the differential ambits of the first and the second parts of Sec. 2(j). Both read together and each
viewed from the angle of employer or employee and applied in its sphere, as the learned Attorney
General pointed out, will make sense. If the nature of the activity is para-trade or quasi-business, it
is of no moment that it is undertaken in the private sector, joint sector, public sector, philanthropic
sector or labour sector ‘it is industry’. It is the human sector, the way the employer- employee a
relations are set up and processed that gives rise to claims, demands, tensions, adjudications,
settlements truce and peace in industry. That is the raison d' etre of industrial law itself.

Two seminal guidelines of great moment flow from this decision 1. the primary and predominant
activity test; and 2, the integrated activity test. The concrete application of these two-fold tests is
illustrated in the very case. We may set out in the concise words of Subba Rao J., the sum-up :

"The result of the discussion may be summarised thus (1) The definition of "industry"
in the Act is very comprehensive. It is in two parts : one part defines it from the
standpoint of the employer and the other from the standpoint of the employee. If an
activity falls under either part of the definition, it will be an industry within the
meaning of the Act. (2) The history of industrial disputes and the legislation
recognizes the basic concept that the activity shall be an organised one and not that
which pertains to private or personal employment.

(3) The regal functions described as primar y and inalienable functions of State though statutorily
delegated to a corporation are necessarily excluded from the purview of the definition. Such regal
functions shall be confined to legislative power, administration of law and judicial power. (4) Ifa
service rendered by an individual or private person would be an industry, it would equally be an
industry in the hands of a Corporation. (5) If a service rendered by a corporation is an industry, the
employees in the departments connected with that service, whether financial, administrative or
executive, would be entitled to the benefits of the Act (6) If a department of a municipality
discharged many functions, some pertaining to industry as defined in the Act and other
nonindustrial activities, the predominant functions of the department shall be the criterion for the
purpose of the Act."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 39Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

By these tokens, which find assent from us, the tax department of the local body is ‘industry’. The
reason is this.

"The scheme of the Corporation Act is that taxes and fees are collected in order to
enable the municipality to discharge its statutory functions. If the functions so
discharged are wholly or predominantly covered by definition of "industry", it would
be illogical to exclude the tax department from the definition. While in the case of
private individuals or firms services are paid in cash or otherwise, in the case of
public institutions, as the services are rendered to the public, the taxes collected from
them constitute a fund for performing those services. As most of the services
rendered by the municipality come under the definition of "industry", we, ,should
hold that the employees of the tax department are also entitled to the benefits under
the Act.

The health department of the municipality too is held in that case to be 'industry- a fact which is
pertinent when we deal later with hospitals, dispensaries and health centres.

"This department looks after scavenging, sanitation, control of epidemics, control of
food adulteration and running of public dispensaries. Private institutions can also
render these services. It is said the control of food adulteration and the control of
epidemics cannot be done by private individuals and institutions. We do ‘not see why.
There can be private medical units to help in the control of epidemics for
remuneration. Individuals may get the food articles purchased by them examined by
the medical unit and take necessary action against guilty merchants. So too, they can
tak e advantage of such a unit to prevent epidemics by having 17-211. SCI/78 .lm15
necessary inoculations and advice. This department also satisfies the other tests laid
down by us, and is an industry within the meaning of the definition of 'industry"

in the Act."
Even the General Administration Department is ‘industry’. Why ?

"Every big company with different sections will have a general administration department. If the
various depart- ments collated with the department are industries, this department would also be a
part of the industry. Indeed the efficient rendering of all the services would depend upon the proper
working of this department, for, otherwise there would be confusion and chaos. The state Industrial
Court in this case has held that all except five of the departments of the Corporation come under the
definition of "industry" and if so, it follows that this department, dealing predominantly with
industrial departments, is also an industry. Hence the employees of this department are also
entitled to the benefits of this Act."

Running right through are three tests : (a) the paramount and predominant duty criterion (p. 971);
(b) the specific service being an integral, non-severable part of the same activity (P. 960) and (c) the

irrelevance of the statutory duty aspect.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 40Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

"It is said that the functions of this department are statutory and no private
individual can discharge those statutory functions. The question is not whether the
discharge of certain functions by the Corporation have statutory backing, but whether
those functions can equally be performed by private individuals. The provisions of
the Corporation Act and the bye- laws prescribe certain specifications for submission
of plans and for the sanction of the authorities concerned before the building is put
up. The same thing can be done by a co-operative society or a private individual.
Co-operative societies and private individuals can allot lands for building houses in
accord- ance with the conditions prescribed by law in this regard. The services of this
department are therefore analogous to those of a private individual with the
difference that one has the statutory sanction behind it and the other is governed by
terms of contracts."

Be it noted that even co-operatives are covered by the learned Judge although we may deal with that
matter a little later.

The same Bench decided both Corporation of Nagpur and Hospital Mazdoor Sabha. This latter case
may be briefly considered now. It repels the profit motive and quid pro quo theory as having any
hearing on the question. The wider import of Sec. 2(j) is accepted but it eXpelS essential ‘sovereign
activities from its' scope.

It is necessary to note that the hospital concerned in that case was run by Government for medical
relief to the people. Nay more. It had a substantial educational and training role.

"This group serves as a clinical training group for students of the Grant Medical
College which is a Government Medical College run and managed by the appellant for
imparting medical sciences leading to the Degree of Bachelor of Medicine and
Bachelor of Surgery of the Bombay University as well as various Post-Graduate
qualifications of the said University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
Bombay; the group is thus run and managed by the appellant to provide medical
relief and to promote the health of the people of Bombay."

And yet the holding was that it was an Industry. Medical education, without mincing words, is
‘industry’. It has no vulgarising import at all since the term ‘industry as a technical one for the
purpose of the Act, even as a master- piece of painting is priceless aft but is 'goods' under the Sales
Tax Law, without any philistinic import. Law abstracts certain attributes of persons or things and
assigns Juridical values without any pejorative connotation about other aspects. The Court
admonishes that :

"Industrial adjudication has necessarily to be aware of the current of socioeconomic
thought ground; it must recognise that in the modern welfare State healthy industrial

persistent, phenomenon of modern industrialised States. II attempting to solve

industrial disputes industrial adjudication does not and should not adopt a
doctrinaire approach. It must evolve some working principles and should generally
avoid formulating or adopting abstract generalisations. Nevertheless it cannot harm
back to old age notions about th e relations between employer and employee or to the
doctrine of laissez faire which then governed the regulation of the said relations. That
is why, we think in construe in the wide words used in Section 2(j) it would be
erroneous to attach undue importance to attributes associated with business or trade
in the popular mind in days gone by. " (pp.

875-6) Again, this note is reported on a later page "Isaacs J. has uttered a note of caution that in
dealing with industrial disputes industrial adjudicators must be conversant with the current
knowledge on the subject and they should not ignore the constant currents of life around them for
otherwise it would introduce a serious infirmity in their approach. Dealing with the general
characteristics of industrial enterprise the learned Judge observed that they contribute more or less
to the general welfare of the community." p. 883) A conspectus of the clauses has induced
Gajendragadkar J. to take note of the impact of provisions regarding public utility service also :

"f the object and scope of the statute are considered there would be no difficulty in
holding that the relevant words of wide import have been deliberately used by the
Legislature in defining "industry" in Sec. 2(j). The object of the Act was to make
provision for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes, and the extent
and scope of its provisions would be realised if we bear in mind the definition of
"industrial dispute" given by Sec. 2(k), of " wages" by Sec. 2(rr), "workman" by S.
2(s), and of "employer" by s.

2(g). Besides, the definition of a public utility service prescribed by S. 2(m) is very significant. One
has merely to glance at the six categories of public utility service mentioned by s. 2(m) to realise that
the rule of construction on which the appellant relies is inapplicable in interpreting the definition
prescribed by s. 2(j) " (p. 875) The positive delineation of 'industry' is set in these terms activity
systematically or habitually undertaken for the production or distribution of goods or for the
rendering of material service to the community at large or a part of such community with the help of
employees is an undertaking. Such an activity generally involves the cooperation of the employer
and the employees; and its object is the satisfaction of material human needs. It must be organised
or arranged in a manner in which trade or business is generally organised or arranged. It must not
be casual nor must it be for oneself nor for pleasure. Thus the manner in which the activity in
question is organised or arranged, the condition of the co-operation between employer and the
employee necessary for its success and its object to render material service to the community can be
regarded as some of the features which are distinctive of activities to which s. 2(j) applies. Judged
by this test there would be no difficulty in holding that the State is carrying on an undertaking when
it runs the group of Hospitals in question." (p. 879) Again, "It is the character of the activity which
decides the question as to whether the activity in question attracts the provision of Sec. 2(j); who
conducts the activity and whether it is conducted for profit or not do not make a material
difference." (p. 878) By these tests even a free or charitable hospital is an industry. That the court
intended such a conclusion is evident :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 42Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

"If that be so, if a private citizen runs a hospital without charging any fees from the
patients treated in it, it would nevertheless be an undertaking under s. 2(j) Thus the
character of the activity involved in running a hospital brings the institution of the
hospital within s. 2(Gj)"

The 'rub' with the ruling, if we may with great deference say so, begins when the Court inhibits itself
from effectuating the logical thrust of its own crucial ratio :

beseeeaaes though S. 2 (j) uses words of very wide denotation, a line would have to be
drawn in a fair and just manner, so as to exclude some callings, services or
undertakings. If all the words used are given their widest meaning, all services and all
callings would come within the purview of the definition; even service rendered by a
servant purely in a personal or domestic matter or even in a casual way would fall
within the definition. It is not and cannot be suggested that in its wide sweep the,
word "service" is intended to include service howsoever rendered in whatsoever
capacity and for whatsoever reason. We must, therefore, consider where the line
should be drawn and what limitations can and should be reasonably implied in
interpreting the wide words used in s. 2(j);

and that no doubt is a somewhat difficult problem to decide."(p.876) What is a ‘fair and just manner'
? It must be founded on grounds Justifiable by principle derived from the statute if it is not to be
sublimation of subjective phobia, rationalization of interests or judicialisation of non- juristic
negatives. And this bunch, in our respectful view, has been proved true not by positive
pronouncement in the case but by two points suggested but left open. One relates to education and
the other to professions. We will deal with them in due course.

Liberal Professions When the delimiting line is drawn to whittle down a wide definition, a principled
working test, not a projected wishful thought, should be sought. This conflict surfaced in the
Solicitor's case (1962 Supp. (3) S.C.R. 157). Before us too, a focal point of contest was as to whether
the liberal- professions are, ipso facto, excluded from "Industry'. Two grounds were given by
Gajendragadkar, J. for over-ruling Sri A. S. R. Chari's submissions. The doctrine of direct
co-operation and the features of liberal professions were given as good reasons to barricade
professional enterprises from the militant clamour for more by lay labour. The learned judge
expressed himself on the first salvational plea :

"When in the Hospital case this Court referred to the Organisation of the undertaking
involving the co-operation of capital and labour or the employer and his employees, it
obviously meant the co-operation essential and necessary for the purpose of
rendering material service or for the purpose of production. It would be realised that
the concept of industry postulates partnership between capital and labour or between
the employer and his employees. It is under this partnership that the employer
contributes his capital and the employees their labour and the joint contribution of
capital and labour leads directly to the production which the industry has in view. In
other words, the co-operation between capital and labour or between the employer

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 43Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

and his employees which is treated as a working test in determining whether any
activity amounts to an industry, is the co- operation which is directly involved in the
production of goods or in the rendering of service. It cannot be suggested that every
form or aspect of human activity in which capital and labour co-operate or employer
and employees assist each other is an industry. The distinguishing feature of an
industry. is that for the production of goods or for the rendering of service,
co-operation between capital and labour or between the employer and his employees
must be direct and must be essential." pp. 163-164 Co-operation to which the test
refers must be co-operation between the employer and his employees which is
essential for carrying out the purpose of the enterprise and the service to be rendered
by the enterprise should be the direct outcome of the combined efforts of the
employer and the employees.

The second reason for exoneration is qualitative. 'Looking at this question in a broad
and general way, it is not easy to conceive that a liberal profession like that of an
attorney could have been intended by the Legislature to fall within the definition of
"industry" under s. 2(j). The very concept of the liberal professions has its own
special and distinctive features which do not readily permit the inclusion of the
liberal professions into the four corners of industrial law. The essential basis of an
industrial dispute is that it is a dispute arising between capital and labour in
enterprises where capital and labour combine to produce commodities or to render
service.

This essential basis would be absent in the case of liberal professions. A person following a liberal
profession does not carry on his profession of his employees and the principal, if not the sole, capital
which he brings into his profession is his special or peculiar intellectual and educational equipment.
That is why on broad and general considerations which cannot be ignored, a liberal profession like
that of an attorney"must, we think, be deemed to be outside the definition of 'industry" under
section 2(j)". pp. 167-168 Let us examine these two tests. In the sophisticated, subtle, complex,
assembly-line operations of modern enterprises, the test of 'direct' and ‘indirect’, 'essential' and
'inessential’, will snap easily. In an American automobile manufactory, everything from shipping
iron ore into and shipping care out of the vast complex takes place with myriad major and minor
jobs. A million administrative, marketing and advertising tasks are done. Which, out of this maze of
chores, is direct? A battle may be lost if winter-wear were shoddy. Is the army tailor a direct
contributory ?

An engineer may lose a competitive contract if his typist typed wrongly or shabbily or despatched
late. He is a direct contributory to the disaster. No lawyer or doctor can impress client or court if his
public relations job or home work were poorly done, and that part depends on smaller men,
adjuncts. Can the great talents in administration, profession, science or art shine if a secretary fades
or faults ? The whole theory of direct co-operation is an improvisation which, with great respect,
hardly impresses. Indeed, Hidayatullah, C.J., in Gymkhana Club Employee Union(1) scouted the
argument about direct nexus, making specific reference to the Solicitors’ case :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 44Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

beceeees The service of a solicitor was regarded as individual depending upon his
personal qualifications and ability, to which the employees did not contribute directly
or essentially. Their contribution, it was held, had no direct or essential nexus with
the advice or services. In this way learned professions were excluded."

To nail this essential nexus theory, Hidayatullah, C.J., argued "What partnership can
exist between the company and/or Board of Directors on the one hand and the
menial staff employed to sweep floors on the other ? What direct and essen- tial
nexus is there between such employees and production ? This proves that what must
be established is the existence of an industry viewed from the angle of what the
employer is doing and if the definition from the angle of the employer's occupation is
satisfied, all who render service and fall within the definition of workman come
within the fold of industry irrespective of what they do. There is then no need to
establish a partnership as such in the production of material goods or material
services. Each person doing his appointed task in an Organisation will be a part of
industry whether he attends to a loom or merely polishes door handles. The fact of
employment as envisaged in the second part is enough provided there is an industry
and the employee is a workman. The learned professions are not industry not
because there is absence of such partnership but because viewed from the angle of
the employer's occupation, they do not satisfy the test."

Although Gajendragadkar J. in Solicitor's case and Hidayatullah, J. in Gymkhana case agreed that
the learned professions must be excluded, on the question of direct or effective contribution in
partnership, they flatly contradicted each other. The reasoning on this part of the case which has
been articulated in the Gymkhana Club Employees Union (supra) appeals to us. There is no need for
insistence upon the ,principle of partnership, the doctrine of direct nexus or the contribution of
values by employees. Every employee in a professional office, ,be he a paralegal assistant or
full-fledged professional employee or, (1) [1968] 1 S.C.R. 742.

down the ladder, a mere sweeper or janitor, every-one makes for the success of the office, even the
mali who collects flowers and places a beautiful bunch in. a vase on the table spreading fragrance
and pleasantness around. The failure of anyone can mar even the success of everyone else. Efficient
collectivity is the essence of professional success. We reject the plea that a member of a learned or
liberal profession, for that sole reason, can self-exclude himself from operation of the Act.

The professional immunity from Labour's demand for social justice because learned professions
have a halo also stands on sandy foundation and, perhaps, validates G. B. Shaw's witticism that an
professions are conspiracies against the laity. After all, let us be realistic and recognise that we live
in an age of experts alias professionals, each having his ethic, monopoly, prestige, power and profit.
Proliferation of professions is a ubiquitous phenomenon and none but the tradition bound will agree
that theirs is not a liberal profession. Lawyers have their code. So too medicos swearing by
Hippocrates, chartered accountants and company secretaries and other autonomous nidi of
know-how. Sociological critics have tried to demythologize the learned professions. Perhaps they
have exaggerated. Still it is there. The politics, of skill, not service of the people, is the current

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 45Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

orientation, according to a recent book on 'Professions For the People’:

"The English professions in the eighteenth century were an acceptable successor to
the feudal ideal of landed property as a means of earning a living. Like landed
property, a professional "competence" conveniently "broke the direct connection
between work and income...... (Reader, 1966, P. 3) for the gentryman. A professional
career provided effects, aristocratic, protective coloration, and at the same time
enabled one to make a considerable sum of money without sullying his hands with a
"job" or "trade". One could carry on commerce by sleigh of hand while donning the
vestments of professional altruism. To boot, one could also work without appearing
to derive income directly from it. As Reader explains :

"The whole subject of payment .... seems to have caused professional men acute
embarrassment, making them take refuge in elaborate concealment, fiction, and
artifice. The root of the matter appears to lie in the feeling that it was not fitting for
one gentleman to pay another for services rendered, particularly if the money passed
directly. Hence, the device of paying a barrister's fee to the attorney, not to the
barrister himself. Hence, also the convention that in many professional dealings the
matter of the fee was never openly talked about, which could be very convenient,
since it precluded the client or patient from arguing about whatever sum his advisor
might eventually indicate as a fitting honorarium (1966, p. 37). The established
professions-the law, medicine, and the clergy-held (or continued to hold) estate- Eke
positions The three ‘liberal professions’ of the 'eighteenth century were the nucleus
about which the professional class of the nineteenth century was to form. We have
seen that they were united by the bond of classical education; that their broad and
ill-defined functions covered much that later would crystallise out into now,
specialised, occupations; that each, ultimately, derived much of its standing with the
established order in the State.... (1966, p. 23)"

In the United States, professional associations are guilds in modern dress. ,,Modern
professional associations are organizational counterparts of the guilds, They are
occupational self-interest organisations. In as much as the professions still perform
custom work and exercise a monopoly of training and skill, the guild analogy is
plausible. However, aspects of economic history lead to a different conclusion. There
has been a shift of emphasis on the part of professionals from control over the quality
of the product or service, to control of price."

Indeed, in America, professionals advertise, hold a strict monopoly, charge heavy fees and wear
humanitarianism as an altruist mask. In England a Royal Commission has been appointed to go into

certain aspects of the working of the legal profession.

The observer, in a leading article 'WIGS ON THE GREEN" dated 15 February, 1976, wrote :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 46Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

"In preparing for the challenge of a Royal Commission, lawyers ought to realise how
deep public disillusionment goes, how the faults of the legal system are magnified by
the feeling that the legal profession is the most powerful pressure group-some would
say a mutual protection society-in the land, with its loyal adherents in Westminster,
Whitehall, and on the bench, like a great freemasonry designed to protect the status
quo.

It robs the client of the benefits of free competition among barristers for his custom.
It confirms his impression that Her Majesty's courts, which he rightly regards as part
of the service the State offers to all its citizens, are a private benefit society for
lawyers.

The fees that lawyers are paid, and the services that they give in return, must also be
studied. A recent survey suggested that in one criminal court 79 per cent of barristers
in contested cases and 96 per cent in uncontested cases saw their clients only on the
morning of the hearing. How much is that worth ?

For Britain at present has a legal system which Often looks as anachronistic as its
wigs and gowns, a system in which solicitors are plentiful in well-to-do areas, and
inaccessi- ble in less fashionable districts; in which the law appears suited only to the
property rights of the middle class, but oblivious of the new problems of poorer and
less well- educated people, who need help with their broken marriages or their
landlord-and-tenant disputes. Sooner rather than later, the legal system must be
made to appear less like a bastion of privilege, more like a defender of us all."

The American Medical Association has come in for sharp social criticism and litigative challenge.
Which architect, engineer or auditor has the art to make huts, landscape little villages or bother
about small units ? And which auditor and company secretary has not been Pressured to break with
morals by big business ? Our listening posts are raw life.

The Indian Bar and Medicine have a high social ethic upto now. Even so, Dabolkar(1) cannot be
ignored as freak or recondite. Doctors have been criticised for unsocial conduct. The halo conjured
up in the Solicitor's case hardly serves to 'de-industrailise' the professions. After all, it is not infra dig
for lawyers, doctors, engineers, architects, auditors, company secretaries or other professionals to
regard themselves as workers in their own sphere or employers or suppliers of specialised service to
society. Even justicing is service and, but for the exclusion from industry on the score of sovereign
functions, might qualify for being regarded as ‘industry’. The plea of ‘profession’ is irrelevant for the
industrial law except as expression of an anathema. No legal principle supports it. Speaking
generally, the editors of the book Professions for the People earlier mentioned state :

"Jethro K. Lisberman (1970, p. 3) warns : "Professionals are dividing the world into
spheres, of influence and erecting large signs saying "experts at work here, do not
proceed further." He shows that via such mechanisms as licensing, self-regulation,
and political pressure the profession are augmenting the erosion of democracy.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 47Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

Professional turf is now ratified by the rule of law. If there is the case, it represents a
significant development : the division of labour in society is again moving towards
the legalisation of social status quo occupational role s."

All this adds up to the decanonisation of the noble professions. Assuming that a professional in our
egalitarian ethos is like any other man of common clay plying a trade or business, we cannot assent
to the cult of the elite in carving out islands of exception to ‘industry’, (1) A.I.R. 1976. S.C. 242 The
more serious argument of exclusion urged to keep the professions out of the coils of industrial
disputes and the employees' demands backed by agitations 'red in tooth and claw' is a sublimated
version of the same argument. Professional expertise and excellence with its occupational
autonomy, ideology, learning, bearing and morality, holds aloft a standard of service which centres
round the individual doctor, lawyer, teacher or auditor. This reputation and quality of special service
being of the essence, the co-operation of the workmen in this core activity of professional offices is
absent. The clerks and stenos, the bell-boys and doormen, the sweepers and menials have no art or
part in the soul of professional functions with its higher code of ethic and intellectual proficiency,
their contribution being peripheral and low-grade, with no relevance to the clients' wants and
requirements. This conventional model is open to the sociological criticism that it is an ideological
clock conjured up by highborn, a posture of noblesse oblige which is incongruous with raw life
especially in the democratic third world and post- industrial societies. To hug the past is to
materialise the ghost. The paradigms of professionalism are gone. In the large solicitors’ firms,
architects' offices, medical polyclinics and surgeries, we find a humming industry, each section
doing its work with its special flavour and culture and code, and making the end product worth its
price. In a regular factory you have highly skilled technicians whose talent is of the essence,
managers whose ability organizes and workmen whose coordinated input is, from one angle,
secondary, from another, significant. Let us look at a surgery or walk into a realtor's firm. What
physician or surgeon will not kill if an attendant errs or clerk enters wrong or dispenses deadly dose
? One such disaster somewhere in the assembly line operations and the clientele will be scared
despite the doctor's distilled skill. The lawyer is no better and just cannot function without the
specialised supportive tools of paraprofessionals like secretaries, librarians, and law-knowing
steno-typists or even the messengers and telephone girls. The mystique of professionalism easily
melts in the hands of modern social scientists who have (as Watergate has shown in America and
has India had its counterpart?) debunked and stripped the professional emperor naked. ‘Altruism’
has been exposed, cash has overcome craft nexus and if professionalism is a mundane ideology, then
"profession" and "professional" are sociological contributions to the pile. Anyway, in- the
sophisticated organization of expert services, all occupations have central skills, an occupational
code of ethics, a group culture, some occupational-authority, and some permission to monopoly
practice from the community. This incisive approach makes it difficult to 'caste-ify' or 'class-ify' the
‘liberal professions as part and beyond the pale of 'industry' in our democracy. We mean no
disrespect to the members of the professions. Even the judicial profession or administrative
profession cannot escape the winds of social change. We may add that the modern world,
particularly the third world, can hope for a human tomorrow only through professions for the
people, through expertise at the service of the millions. Indian primitivism can be banished only by
pro bono publico professions in the field of law, medicine, education, engineering and what not. But
hat radicalism does not detract from the thesis that ‘industry’ does not spare professionals. Even so,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 48Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

the widest import may still self-exclude the little moffusil lawyer, the small rural medico or the
country engineer, even though a hired sweeper or factotum assistant may work with him. We see no
rationale in the claim to carve out islets. Look. A solicitor's firm or a lawyer's firm becomes
successful not merely by the talent of a single lawyer but by the co- operative operations of several
specialists, juniors and seniors. Likewise the ancillary services of competent stenographers,
paralegal supportive services are equally important. The same test applies to other professions. The,
conclusion is inevitable that contribution to the success of the institution-every professional unit has
an institutional good-will and reputation-comes not merely from the professional or specialist but
from all those whose excellence in their respective parts makes for the total proficiency. We have,
therefore, no doubt that the claim for exclusion on the score of liberal professions is unwarranted
from a functional or definitional angle. The flood-gates of exemption from the obligations,under the
Act will be opened if professions flow out of its scope. Many callings may clamour to be regarded as
liberal professions. In an age when traditions have broken down and the old world professions of
liberal descent have begun. to resort to commercial practices (even legally, as in America, or
factually, as in some other countries) exclusion under this new label will be infliction of injury on the
statutory intent and effect.

The result of this discussion is that the solicitors' case is wrongly decided and must, therefore, be'
over-ruled. We must hasten, however, to repeat that a small category, perhaps large in numbers in
the muffasil, may not squarely fall within the definition of industry. A single lawyer, a rural medical
practitioner or urban doctor with a little assistant and/or menial servant may ply a profession but
may not be said to run an industry. That is not because the employee does not make a contribution
nor because the profession is too high to be classified as a trade or industry with its commercial
connotations but because there is nothing like organised labour in such employment. The image of
industry or even quasi-industry is one of a plurality of workmen, not an isolated or single little
assistant or attendant. The latter category is more or less like personal avocation for livelihood
taking some paid or part-time from another. The whole purpose of the Industrial Disputes Act is to
focus on resolution of industrial dis- putes and regulation of industrial relations and not to meddle
with every little carpenter in a village or blacksmith in a town who sits with his son or assistant to
work for the customers who trek in. The ordinary spectacle of a cobbler and his assistant or a cycle
repairer with a helper, we come across in the payments of cities and towns, repels the idea of
industry and industrial dispute. For this reason, which applies all along the line, to small
professions, petty handicraftsmen, domestic servants and the like, the solicitor or doctor or rural
engineer, even like the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker, with an assistant or without,
does not fall within the definition of industry. In regular industries, of course, even a few employees
are enough to bring them within sec. 2(s). Otherwise automated industries will slip through the net.
Education We will now move. on to a consideration of education as an industry.try. If the triple tests
of 'systematic activity, co-operation between employer and employee and production of goods and
services were alone to be applied, a University, a college, a research institute or teaching institution
will be an industry. But in University of Delhi(1) it was held that the Industrial Tribunal was wrong
in regarding the University as an industry because it would be inappropriate to describe education
as an industrial activity. Gajendragadkar J. agreed in his. judgment that the employer- employee
test was satisfied and cooperation between the two was also present. Undoubtedly, education is a
sublime cultural service, technological training and personality builder. A man without education is

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 49Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

a brute and no body can quarrel with the proposition that education, in its spectrum, is significant
service to the community. We have already given extracts from Australian Judge Issacs J., to,
substantiate the thesis that education is not merely industry but the mother of industries. A
philistinic, illi- terate society will be not merely uncivilised but incapable of industrialisation.
Nevertheless Gajendragadkar J., observed :

"It would, no doubt, sound somewhat strange that education should be described as industry and
the teachers as workmen within the meaning of the Act, but if the literal construction for which the
respondents contend is accepted, that consequence must follow." Why is it strange to regard
education as an industry ? Its respectability ? Its lofty character ? Its professional stamp ? Its
cloistered virtue which cannot be spoiled by the commercial implications and the raucous voices of
workmen ? Two reason conclusion that imparting education is an industry. The first ground relied
on by the Court is based upon the preliminary conclusion that teachers are not 'workmen' by
definition. Perhaps, they are not are given to avoid the because teachers do not do manual work or
technical work. We are not too sure whether it is proper to disregard, with contempt, manual work
and separate it from education, nor are we too sure whether in our technological universe, education
has to be excluded. However, that may be a battle to be waged on a later occasion by litigation and
we do not propose to pronounce on it at present. The Court, in the University of Delhi, proceeded on
that assumption viz. that teachers are not workmen, which we will adopt to test the validity of the
argument.') The reasoning of the Court is best expressed in the words of. Gajendragadkar, J. :

"It is common ground that teachers employed by educational institutions, whether
the said institutions are imparting primary, secondary, collegiate or postgraduate
education, are not workmen under s. 2(s), and so, it follows that the whole body of
employees with whose co
operation the (1) [1961] 2 S.C.R. 703.

.lm15 work of imparting education is carried on by educational institutions do not fall within the
purview of s. 2(s) and any disputes between them and the institutions which employed them are
outside the scope of the Act. In other words, if imparting education is an industry under S. 2(j), the
bulk of the employees being outside the purview of the Act, the only disputes which can fall within
the scope of the Act are those which arise between such institutions and their subordinate staff, the
members of which" may fall under s. 2 (s) In our opinion, having regard to the fact that the work of
education is primarily and exclusively carried on with the assistance of the labour and co- operation
of teachers, the omission of the whole class of teachers, from the definition prescribed by s. 2(s) has
an important bearing and significance in relation to the problem which we are considering. It could
not have been the policy of the Act that education should be treated as industry for the benefit of a
very minor and insignificant number of persons who may be employed by educational institutions to
carry on the duties of the subordinate staff. Reading ss, 2(g), (j) and (s) together, we are inclined to
hold that the work of education carried on by educational institutions like the University of Delhi is
not an industry within the meaning of the Act." The second argument which appealed to the Court
to reach its conclusion is that : "the distinctive purpose and object of education would make it very
difficult to assimilate it to the position of any trade, business or calling or service within the meaning

of sec. 2(j)." Why so ? The answer is given by the learned judge himself :

"Education seeks to build up the personality of the pupil by assisting his physical,
intellectual, moral and emotional development. To speak of this educational process
in terms of industry sounds so. completely incongruous that one is not surprised that
the Act has deliberately so defined workmen under S. 2(s) as to exclude teachers from
its scope. Under the sense of values recognised both by the traditional and
conservative as well as the modern and progressive social outlook, teaching and
teachers are, no doubt, assigned a high place of honour and it is obviously necessary
and desirable that teaching and teachers should receive the respect that is due to
them. A proper sense of values would naturally hold teaching and teachers in high
esteem, though power or wealth may not be associated with them. It cannot be
denied that the concept of social justice is wide enough to include teaching and
teachers, and the requirement that teachers should receive proper emoluments and
other amenities which is essentially based on social justice cannot be disputed; but
the effect of excluding teachers ‘from s. 2(s) is only this that the remedy available for
the betterment of their financial prospects does not fall under the Act. It is well
known that Education Departments of the State Governments as well as the Union
Government, and the University Grants Commission carefully consider this problem
and assist the teachers by requiring the payment to them of proper scales of pay and
by insisting on the fixation of other reasonable terms and conditions of service in
regard to teachers engaged in primary and secondary education and collegiate
education which fall under their respective jurisdic- tions. The position nevertheless
is clear that any problems connected with teachers and their salaries are outside the
purview of the Act, and since the teachers form the sole class employees with whose
co-operation education is imparted by educational institutions, their exclusion from
the purview of the Act necessarily corroborates the conclusion that education itself is
not without its scope."

Another reason has also been adduced to reinforce this conclusion :

other educational institutions are not formed or conducted for making profit; no
doubt, the absence of profit motive would not take the work of any institution outside
S. 2(j) if the requirements of the said definition are otherwise satisfied. We have
referred to the absence of profit motive only to emphasise the fact that the work
undertaken by such educational institutions differs from the normal concept of trade
or business. Indeed, from a rational point of view, it would be regarded as
inappropriate to describe education even as a profession. Education in its true aspect
is more a mission and a vocation rather than a profession or trade or business,
however wide may be the denotation of the two latter words under the Act. That is
why we think it would be unreasonable to hold that educational institutions are
employers within the meaning of s. 2(g), or that the work of teaching carried on by
them is an industry under s. 2(j), because essentially, the creation of a well-educated
healthy young generation imbued with a rational progressive outlook on life which is

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

the sole aim of education, cannot at all be compared or assimilated with what may be
described as an industrial process."

The Court was confronted by the Corporation of Nagpur where it had been expressly held that the
education department of the Corporation was service rendered by the department and so the
subordinate menial employees of the department came under the definition of employees and would
be entitled to the benefits of the Act. This was explained away by the suggestion that "the question as
to whether educational work carried on by educational institutions like the University of Delhi
which have been formed primarily and solely for the purpose of imparting education amounts to an
industry within the meaning of s. 2(j), was not argued before the Court and was not really raised in
that form."

We dissent, withutmost deference, from these propositions and are inclined to hold,as the
Corporation of Nagpur held, that. education is industry, and as Isaacs J., hold, in the Australian case
(supra), that education is pre- eminently service.

The, actual decision in University of Delhi was supported by another ground, namely, that the
predominant activity of the university was teaching and since teachers did not come within the
purview of the, Act, only the incidental activity of the subordinate staff could fall within its scope but
that could not alter the predominant character of the insti- tution.

We may deal with these contentions in a brief way, since the substantial grounds on which we reject
the reasoning have already been set out elaborately. The premises relied on is that the bulk. of the
employees in the university is the teaching community. Teachers are not workmen and cannot raise
disputes under the Act. The subordinate staff being only a minor category of insignificant numbers,
the institu- tion must be excluded, going by the predominant character test. It is one thing to say
that an institution is not an industry. It is altogether ,another thinking to say that a large number of
its employees are not workmen’ and cannot therefore, avail of the benefits of the. Act so the
institution ceases to be an industry. The test is not the predominant number of employees entitled to
enjoy the benefits of the Act. The true test is the predominant nature of the activity. In the case of
the university or an educational institution, the nature of the activity is, ex hypothesis education
which is a service to the community. Ergo, the university is an industry. The error has crept in, if we
may so say with great respect, in mixing up the numerical strength of the personnel with the nature
of the activity.

Secondly there are a number of other activities of the University Administration, demonstrably
industrial which are severable although ancillary to the main cultural enterprise. For instance, a
university may have a large printing press as a separate but considerable establishment. It may have
a large fleet of transport buses with an army of running staff. It may have a tremendous
administrative strength of officers and clerical cadres. It may have karamcharis of various hues. As
the Corporation of Nagpur has effectively ruled, these operations, viewed in severally or collectively,
may be treated as industry. It would be strange, indeed, if a university has 50 transport buses, hiring
drivers, conductors, cleaners and workshop technicians. How are they to be denied the benefits of
the Act, especially when their work is separable from academic teaching, merely because the buses

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 52Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

are owned by the same corporate personality ? We find, with all defence, little force in this process
of nullification of the industrial character of the University's multi-form operations. The next
argument which has appealed to the Court in that case is that education develops the personality of
the pupil and this process, if described as industry, sounds grotesque. We are unable to appreciate
the force of this reasoning, if we may respectfully say so. It is true that our social values assign a high
place of honour to education, but how does it follow from this that education is not a service the
sequitur is not easily discernible. The pejorative assumption seems to be that 'Industry' is something
vulgar, interior, disparaging And should not be allowed to sully the sanctified subject of education.
In our view, industry is a noble term and embraces even the most sublime activity. At any rate, in
legal terminology located in the statutory definition it is not money-making, it is not lucre-loving, it
is not commercialising, it is not profit hunger. On the other hand, a team of painters who produce
works of art and sell them or an orchestra group winch travels and performs and makes money may
be an industry if they employ supportive staff of artistes or others. There is no regarding touch about
‘industry’, especially in the light of Mahatma Gandhi's dictum that 'Work is Worship’. Indeed the,
colonial system of education, which divorced book learning from manual work and practical
training, has been responsible for the calamities in that field. For that very reason, Gandhiji and Dr.
Zakir Hussain propagated basic education which used work as modus operandi for teaching. We
have hardly any hesitation in regarding education as an industry.

The final ground accepted by the Court is that education is a mission and vocation, rather than a
profession or trade or business. The most that one can say is that this is an assertion which does not
prove itself. Indeed, all life is a mission and a man without a mission is spiritually still- born. The
high mission of life is the manifestation of the divinity already in man. To christen education as a
mission, even if true, is not to negate its being an industry. We have to look at educational activity
from the angle of the Act, and so viewed the ingredients of education are fulfilled. Education is,
therefore, an industry and nothing can stand in the way of that conclusion. It may well be said by
realists in the cultural field that educational managements depend so much on governmental
support and some of them charge such high fees that schools have become trade and managers
merchants. Whether this will apply to universities or not, schools and colleges have been accused, at
least in the, private sector, of being tarnished with trade motives.

Let us trade romantics for realities and see. With evening classes, correspondence courses,
admissions unlimited, fees and government grants escalating, and certificates and degrees for
prices, education legal, medical, technological, school level or collegiate-education-is riskless trade
for cultural 'entrepreneurs and hapless posts of campus (industrial) unrest. Imaginary assumptions
are experiments with untruth.

our conclusion is that the University of Delhi case was wrongly decided and that education can be
and is, in its institutional form, an industry.

18-211SCI/78 Are Charitable Institutions Industries ? Can charity be 'industry' ? This paradox can
be unlocked only by examining the nature of the activity of the charity, for there are charities and
charities. The grammar of labour law in a pluralist society tells us that the worker is concerned with
wages and conditions of service, the. employer with output and economies and the community with

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 53Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

peace, production and stream of supply. This complex of work, wealth and happiness, firmly
grasped, will dissolve the dilemma of the law bearing on charitable enterprises. Charity is free;
industry is business. Then how ? A lay look may scare; a legal look will, see; a social look will see
through a hiatus inevitable in a sophisticated society with organizational diversity and motivational
dexterity. If we mull over the major decisions, we get a hang of the basic structure of 'industry' in its
legal anatomy. Bedrocked on the groundnorms, we must analyse the elements of charitable
economic enterprises, established and maintained for satisfying human wants. Easily, three broad
categories emerge more may exist. The charitable element enlivens the operations at different levels
in these patterns and the legal consequences fences are different, viewed from the angle of
‘industry’. For income-tax purposes, Trusts Act or company law or registration law or penal code
requirements the examination will be different. We are concerned with a benignant disposition
towards workmen and a, trichotomy of charitable enterprises run for producing and/or supplying
goods and services, organised systematically and employing workmen, is scientific. The first is one
where the enterprise, like any other, yields profits but they are siphoned off for altruistic objects.
The second is one where the institution makes no profit but hires the services of employees as in
other like businesses but the goods and services, which are the output, are made available, at low or
no cost, to the indigent needy who are priced out of the market. The third is where the establishment
is oriented on a humane mission fulfilled by man who work, not because they are paid wages, but
because they share the passion for the cause and derive job satisfaction from their contribution. The
first two are industries, the third not. What is the test of identity whereby these institutions with
eleemosynary inspiration fall or do not fall under the definition of industry ? All industries are
organised, systematic activity. Charitable adventures which do not possess this feature, of course,
are not industries. Sporadic or fugitive strokes of charity do 'not become industries. All three
philanthropic entities, we have itemised, fall for consideration only if they involve co-operation
between employers and employees to produce and/or supply goods and/or services. We assume, all
three do. The crucial difference is over the presence of charity in the quasi business nature of the
activity. Shri Tarkunde, based on Safdarjung, submits that, ex hypothesi, charity frustrates
commerciality and thereby deprives it of the character of industry.

It is common, ground that the first category of charities is disqualified for exemption. If a business is
run for production and or supply of goods and services with an eye ‘on profit, it is plainly an
industry. The fact that the whole or substantial part of the profits so earned is diverted for purely
charitable purposes does not affect the nature. of the economic activity which involves the cooperation of employer and employee and results in the production of goods and services. The
workers are not concerned about the destination of the profits. They work and receive wag leas.
They axe treated like any other workman in any like industry. All the features of an industry, as spelt
out from the definition by the decisions of this Court, are fully present in those' charitable
businesses. In short, they are industries. The application of the income for philanthropic purposes,
instead of filling private coffers, makes no difference either to the employees of to the character of
the activities. Good Samaritans can he clever industrialists.

The second species of charity is really an allotropic modification of the first. If a kind-hearted
businessman or high-minded industrialist or service-minded operator hires employees like his

non-philanthropic counter-parts and, in co-operation with them, produces and supplies goods or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 54Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

services to the lowly and the lost, the needy and the ailing without charging them any price or
receiving a negligible return, people regard him as of charitable disposition and his enterprise as a
charity. But then, so far as the workmen are concerned, it boots little whether he makes available the
products free to the poor. They contribute labour in return for wages and conditions of service. For
them the charitable employer is exactly like a commercial- minded employer. Both exact hard work,
both pay similar wages, both treat them as human machine cogs and nothing more, The material
difference between the commercial and the compassionate employers is not with reference to the
workmen but with reference to the recipients of goods and services. Charity operates not vis-a-vis
the workmen in which case they will be paying a liberal wage and generous extras with no prospect
of strike. The beneficiaries of the employees charity are the indigent consumers. Industrial law does
not take note of such extraneous factors but regulates industrial relations between employers and
employers and workmen and workmen and workmen. From the point of view of the workmen there
is no charity. For him charity must begin at home. From these strands of thought flows the
conclusion that the 'second group may legitimately and legally be des- cribed as industry. The fallacy
in the contrary contention lies in shifting the focus from the worker and the industrial activity to the
disposal of the end product. This law has nothing to do with that. The income-tax may have, social
opinion may have.

Some of the appellants may fall under the second category just described. While we are not
investigating into the merits of those appeals, we may as well indicate, in a general way, that the
Gandhi Ashram, which employs workers like spinners and weavers and supplies cloth or other
handicraft at concessional rates to needy rural consumers, may not qualify for exemption. Even 'so
particular incidents may have to be closely probed before pronouncing with precision upon the
nature of the activity. If cotton or yarn is given free to workers, if charkhas are made available free
for families, if fair price is paid for the net product and substantial charity thus benefits the similar
undertakings and commercial adventures do. To qualify for closely into the character of the
enterprise. If employees are hired and their services are rewarded by wages-whether on cottage
industry or factory basis-the enterprises become industries, even if some kind of concession is
shown and even if the motive and project may be to encourage and help Door families and find them
employment. A compassionate industrialist is nevertheless an industrialist. However, if ,raw
material is made available free and the finished product is fully paid for- rather exceptional to
imagine-the conclusion may be hesitant but for the fact that the integrated administrative, purchase,
marketing advertising and other functions are like in trade and business. This makes them
industries. Noble objectives, pious purposes, spiritual foundation,% and developmental projects are
no reason not to implicate these institutions as industries.

We now move on to economic activities and occupations of an altruistic character falling under the
third category. The heart of trade or business or analogous activity is organisation with an eye on
competitive efficiency, by hiring employees, systematisiig processes, producing goods and services
needed by the community and obtaining money's worth of work from employees. If such be the
nature of operations and employer-employee relations which make an enterprise an industry, the
motivation of the employer in the final disposal of products or profits is immaterial. Indeed the
activity is patterned on a commercial basis, judged by what other similar undertakings and
commercial adventures do. To qualify for exemption from the definition of 'industry' in a case where

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 55Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

there are employers and employees and systematic activities and production of goods and services,
we need a totally different orientation, organisation and method which will stamp on the enterprise
the imprint , of commerciality. Special emphasis, in such cases, must be placed on the central fact of
employer- employee relations. If a philanthropic devotion is the basis for the charitable foundation
or establishment, the institution is beaded by one who wholeheartedly dedicates himself for the
mission and pursues it with passion, attracts Others into the institution,. not for wages but for
sharing in the cause and its fulfillment, then the undertaking is not 'industrial'.. Not that the
presence of charitable impulse. extricates the institution from the definition in Sec. 2(j) but that
there is no economic relationship such as is found in trade or business between the head who
employs and the others who emotively flock to render service. In one sense, there are no employers
and employees but crusaders all. In another sense, there is no wage basis for the employment but
voluntary par
ticipation in the production, inspired by lofty ideals and unmindful of remuneration, service
conditions and the Eke. Supposing there I Ashram or Order with a guru or other head. Let us further
is an assume that there is a band of disciples, devotees or priestly subordinates in the- Order,
gathered together for prayers, ascetic practices, bhajans, meditation and worship. Supposing,
further, that outsiders are also invited daily or occasionally, to share in the spiritual proceedings.
And, let us assume that all the inmates of the Ashram and members of the Order, invitees, guests,
and other outside participants are fed, accommodated and looked after by the institution. In such a
case, as often happens, the cooking and the cleaning, the bed-making and. service’ may often be
done, at least substantially by the Ashramites themselves. They may chant in spiritual ecstasy even
as material goods and services are made and served. They may affectionately look after the guests,
and, all this they may do, not for wages but for the chance to propitiate the Master, work selflessly
and acquire spiritual grace. It may well be that they may have surrendered their lucrative
employment to come into the holy institution. It may also be that they take some small pocket
money from the donations or takings of the institution. Nay more, there may be a few scavengers
and servants, a part-time auditor or accountant employed on wages. If the substantial number of
participants in making- available goods and services, if the substantive nature of the work, as
distinguished from trivial items, is rendered by voluntary wageless sishyas, it is impossible to
designate the institution as an industry, notwithstanding a marginal few who are employed on a
regular basis for hire. The reason is that in the crucial, substantial and substantive aspects of
institutional life the nature of the relations between the participants is non- industrial. Perhaps,
when Mahatma Gandhi lived in Sabarmati, Aurobindo had his hallowed silence in Pondicherry, the
inmates belonged to this chastened brand. Even now, in many foundations, centres, monasteries,
holy orders and Ashrams in the East and in the west, spiritual fascination pulls men and women into
the precincts and they work tirelessly for the Maharishi or Yogi or Swamiji and are not wage earners
in any sense of the term. Such people are not workmen and such institutions are not industries
despite some menials and some professionals in a vast complex being hired. We must look at the
predominant character of the institution and the nature of the relations resulting in the production
of goods and services. Stray wage-earning employees do not shape the soul of an institution into an
industry, It now remains to make a brief survey of the precedents on the point. One case which is
germane to the issue is Bombay Pinjrapole(1). A Bench of this Court considered the earlier case-law,
including the decisions of the High Courts bearing on humane activities for the benefit of sick

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 56Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

animals. Let there be no doubt that kindness to out dumb brethren, especially invalids, springs from
the highest motives of fellow feeling. In the land of the Buddha and Gandhi no one dare argue to the
contrary. So let there be no mistaking (1) [1972] 1 S.C.R. 202 our compassionate attitude to suffering
creatures. It is laudable and situations dedicated to amelioration of conditions of animals deserve
encouragement from the State and affluent philanthropists. But these considerations have no
bearing on the crucial factors which invoke the application of the definition in the Act as already set
out elaborately by us. "The manner in which the activity in question is organised or arranged, the
condition of the cooperation between the employer and the employee necessary for its success and
its object to reader material service to the community" is a pivotal factor in the activity-oriented test
of an ‘industry’. The compassionate motive and "he charitable inspiration are noble but extraneous.
Indeed’, medical relief for human beings made available free by regular hospitals, run by
government or philanthropists, employing doctors and supportive staff and business-like terms,
may not qualify for exemption from industry. Service to animals cannot be on a higher footing than
service to humans. Nor is it possible to contend that love of animals is religious or spiritual any
more than love of human-beings is. A pinjrapole is no church, mosque or temple. Therefore, without
going into the dairying aspects, income and expenditure and other features of Bombay Pinjrapole,
one may hold that the institution is an industry. After all, the employees are engaged, on ordinary
economic terms and with conditions of service as in other business institutions and the activities
also have organisational comparability to other profit-making dairies or Pinjrapoles. What is
different is the charitable object. What is. common is the nature of the employer employees
relations. The conclusion, notwithstanding the humanitarian overtones, is that such organisations
are also industries. Of course, in Bombay Pinjrapole the same conclusion was reached but on
different and, to some extent faulty reasoning. For, the assumption in the judgment of Mitter J., is
that if the income were mostly from donations and the treatment of animals were free, perhaps such
charity, be it a hospital for humans or animals, may not be an industry. We agree with the holding,
not because Pinjrapoles have commercial motives but because, despite compassionate objectives,
they share business-like orientation and operation. In this view, section 2(j) applies.

We may proceed to consider the applicability of Sec. 2(j) to institutions whose objectives and
activities cover the research field in a significant way. This has been the bone of contention in a few
cases in the past and in one of the appeals argued at considerable length and with considerable force
by Shri Tarkunde who has presented a panoramic view of the entire subject in his detailed
submissions. An earlier decision of this Court, The Ahmedabad Textile Industries Research
Association(1)case has taken the view that even research institutes are roped in by the definition but
later judicial thinking at the High Court and Supreme Court levels has leaned more in favour of
exemption where profit-motive has been absent. The Kurji Holy Family Hospital(2) was held not to
be an industry because it was a (1) [1961] 2 S.C.R. 480.

(2) [1971] 1S.C.R. 177.

non-profit-making body and its work was in the nature of training, research and treatment. Likewise
in Dhanrajgirji Hospital v. Workmen(1) a bench of this Court held that the charitable trust which
ran a hospital and served research purposes and training of nurses was not an industry. The High
Courts of Madras and Kerala have also held that research institutes such as the Pasteur Institute, the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 57Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

C.S.I.R. and the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute are not industries. The basic decision
which has gone against the Ahmedabad Textile case is the Safdarjung case. 'We may briefly examine
the rival view-points, although in substance we have already stated the correct principle. The view
that commends itself to us is plainly in reversal of the ratio of Safdarjung which has been wrongly
decided, if we may say so with great respect.

Research Does research involve collaboration between employer and employee ? It does. The
employer is the institution, the employees are the scientists, para-scientists and other personnel. Is
scientific research service ? Undoubtedly it is. Its discoveries are valuable contributions to the
wealth of the nation. Such discoveries may be sold for a heavy price in the industrial or other
markets. Technology has to be plate for and technological inventions and innovations may be
patented and sold. In our scientific and technological age nothing has more cash value, as intangible
goods and invaluable services, than discoveries. For instance, the discoveries of Thomas Alva Edison
made him fabulously rich. It has been said that his brain had the highest cash value in history for he
made the world vibrate with the miraculous discovery of recorded, sound. Unlike most inventors, he
did not have to wait to get his reward in heaven; he received, it munificently on this gratified and
grateful earth, thanks to conversion of his inventions into, money a plenty. Research benefits
industry. Even though a research institute may be a separate entity disconnected from the many
industries which funded the institute itself, it can be regarded as an Organisation, propelled by
systematic activity, modeled on co-operation between employer and employee and calculated to
throw up discoveries and inventions and useful solutions which benefit individual industries and the
nation in terms of goods and services and wealth. It follows that research institutes, albeit run
without profit-motive, are industries. True Shri Tarkunde is right if Safdarjung is rightly decided.
The concluding portions of that decision proceed on the tooting that research and training have an
exclusionary effect. That reasoning, as we have already expounded, hardly has our approval.

Clubs : Are clubs industries ? The wide words used in Sec. 2(f) if applied without rational
limitations, may cover every bilateral activity even spiritual, religious, domestic, conjugal,
pleasurable or political. But functional circumscriptions spring from the subject-matter and other
cognate. considerations already set out early in this judgment. Industrial law, any law, may insanely
run amok if limitless (1) A.I.R. 1975 S.C. 2232.

lexical liberality were to inflate expressions into bursting point or proliferate odd judicial arrows
which at random sent, hits many an irrelevant mark the legislative archer never meant. To read
down words to yield relevant sense is a pragmatic art, if care is taken to eschew subjective
projections masked as judicial processes. The true test as we apprehend from the economic history
and functional philosophy of the Act is based on the pathology of industrial friction and explosion
impeding community production and consumption and imperiling peace and welfare. This social
pathology arises from the exploitative potential latent in organized employer-employee relations.
So, where the dichotomy of employer and workmen in the process of material production is present,
the service of economic friction and need for conflict resolution show up. The Act is meant to obviate
such conformation and 'industry' cannot functionally and defunctionally exceed this object. The
question is whether in a club situation-or of a co-operative or even a monastery situation, for that
matter a dispute potential of the nature suggested exists. If it does, it is an industry, since the basic

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 58Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

elements are satisfied. If productive cooperation between employer and employee is necessary,
conflict between them is on the cards, be it a social club, mutual benefit society, pinjarapole, public
service or professional office. Tested on this touchstone, most clubs will fail to qualify for exemption.
For clubs gentlemen clubs proprietary clubs service clubs investment clubs, sports clubs, art clubs
military clubs or other brands of recreational associations- when x-rayed from the industrial angle
project a picture on the screen typical of employers hirings employees for wages for rendering
services and/or supplying goods on a systematic basis at specified hours. There is a co-operation the
club management providing the capital, the raw materialthe appliances and auxiliaries and the
cooks, waiters, bell boys, pickers bar maids or other servants making available enjoyable eats,
pleasures and other permissible services for price paid by way of subscriptions or bills charged. The
club life' the warm company, the enrichment of the spirits and freshening of the mind are there But
theseblessings do not contradict the co-existence of an 'industry' in the technical sense. Even
tea-tasters, hired for high wages, or commercial art troupes or games teams remunerated
fantastically, enjoy company, taste, travel and games; but, elementally, they are workmen with
employers above and together constitute not merely entertainment groups but industries under the
Act. The protean hues of human organization project delightfully different designs depending upon
the legal prism and the filtering process used. No one can value of club life; neither can anyone blink
at the legal result of the organization. The only ground to extricate clubs from the coils of industrial
law (except specific statutory provision) is absence of employer employee co-operation on thefamiliar luring-firing pattern. Before we explain this possible exemption and it applies to many clubs
at the poorer levels of society we must meet another submission made by counsel. Clubs are
exclusive; they cater to needs and pleasures of members, not of the community as such and this
latter feature salvages them from the clutches of industrial regulation. We do not agree, Clubs are
open to the public for membership subject to their own bye-laws and rules. But any member of the
community complying with those conditions and waiting for his turn has reasonable chance of
membership. Even the world's summit club-the United Nations has cosmic membership subject to
vetoes, qualifications, voting and what not. What we mean is that a club is not a limited partnership
but formed from the community. Moreover, even the most exclusive clubs of imperial vintage and
class snobbery admit members’ guests who are not specific souls but come from the unrefused
community or part of a community. Clubs speaking generally are social institutions enlivening
community life and are the fresh breath of relaxation in a fadedsociety. They serve a section and
answer the doubtful test of serving the community. They are industry.

We have adverted to a possible category of clubs and associations which may swim out of the
industrial pool-we mean self serving clubs, societies or groups or associations. Less fashionable but
more numerous in a poor, populous, culturally hungry country with democratic urges and youthful
vigour is this species. Lest there should be a rush by the clubs we have considered and dismissed to
get into this proletarian brood if we may so describe them to identify, not at all to be pejorative,-we
must elucidate. It is a common phenomenon in parts of our country that workers, harijans, student
youth at the lower rung of the socioeconomic ladder weaker sections like women and low- income,
groups quench their cultural thirst by forming gregarious organisations mainly for recreation. A few
books and magazines, a manuscript house magazine contributed by and circulated among members,
a football or volley ball game in the evenings-not golf, billiards or other expensive games a music or
drama group, an annual day, a competition and pretty little prizes and family get together and even

organising occasional meetings inviting V.I.Ps.-these tiny yet luscent cultural balls dot our
proletarian cheerlessness. And these hopeful organisms, if fostered, give a mass spread for our
national awakening for those for whom no developmental bells yet toll Even these people's organs
cannot be non-industries unless one strict condition is fulfilled. They should be-and usually
are-self-serving. They are poor men's clubs without the wherewithal of a Gyankhana or C.C.I. which
reacted this court for adjudication. Indeed, they rarely reach a court being easily priced out of our
expensive judicial market. These self-service clubs do not have hired employees to cook or serve, to
pick or chase balls, to tie up nets or arrange the cards table, the billiards table, the bar and the bath
or do those elaborate business management chores of the well-run city or country clubs. The
members come and arrange things for themselves. The secretary, an elected member, keeps the key.
Those interested in particular pursuits organise those terms themselves. Even the small accounts or
clerical items are maintained by one member or other. On special evenings all contribute efforts to
make a good 19-211 SCI/78 show, excursion, joy picnic or anniversary celebration. The dynamic
aspect is self-service. In such an institution, a part-time sweeper or scavenger or multi-purpose
attendant may sometimes exit. He may be an employee. This marginal element does not transform a
little association into an industry. We have projected an imprecise profile and there may be minor
variations. The central thrust of our pro- position is that if a club or other like collectivity has a basic
and dominant self-service mechanism, a modicum of employees at the periphery will not
metamorphose it into a conventional club whose verve and virtue are taken care of by paid staff, and
the members' role is to enjoy. The small man's Nehru Club (Gandhi Granthasala, Anna Manram,
Netaji Youth Centre, Brother Music Club, Muslim Sports Club and like organs often named after
natural or provincial heroes and manned by members themselves as contrasted with +,he upper
bracket's Gyamkhana Club, Cosmopolitan Club, Cricket Club of, India, "National Sports Club of
India whose badge is pleasure paid for and provided through skilled or semi- skilled catering staff.
We do not deal with hundred per cent social service clubs which meet once in a way, hire a whole
evening in some hotel, have no regular staff and devote their energies and resources also to social
service projects. There ire many brands and we need not deal with every one. Only if they answer the
test laid down affirmatively they qualify.

The leading cases on the point are Gyamkhana and C.C.I. We must deal with them before we
conclude on this topic. The Madras Gymkhana Club, a blue-blooded, members’ club has the socialite
cream of the city on its rolls. It offers choice facilities for golf, tennis and billiards, arranges dances,
dinners and refreshments, entertains and accommodates guests and conducts tournaments for
members and nonmembers. These are all activities richly charged with pleasurable service. For
fulfilment of these objects the club employs officers, caterers, and others on reasonable salaries.
Does this club become an industry ? The label matters little; the substance is the thing. A night club
for priced nocturnal sex is a lascivious ‘industry’. But a literary club, meeting weekly to read or
discuss poetry, hiring a venue and running solely by the self-help of the participants, is not.
Hidayatullah C.J., in Gymkhana ruled that the club was not an ‘industry’. Reason ? 'An industry is
thus said to involve cooperation between employer and employees for the object of satisfying
material human needs but not for oneself nor for pleasure nor necessarily- for profit.’ "It is not of
any consequence that there is. no profit motive because that is considered immaterial. It is also true
that the affairs of the club are organised in the way business is orgainsed, and that there is
production of material and other services and in a limited way production of material goods mainly

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 60Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

in the catering department. But these circumstances are not truly representative in the case of the
club because the services are to the members themselves for their own pleasure and amusement and
the material goods are for their consumption. In other words, the club exists for its members. No
doubt occasionally strangers also benefit from its services, but they can only do so on invitation of
members. No one outside the list of members has the advantage of these services as of right. Nor can
these, privileges be bought. In fact they are available only to members or through members. If today
the club were to stop entry of outsiders, no essential change in its character vis-a-vis the members
would take place. In other words, the circumstances that guests are admitted is irrelevant to
determine if the club is an industry. Even with the admission of guests being open the club remains
the same, that is to say, a member's self-serving institution. No doubt the material needs or wants of
a section of the community is catered for but that is not enough. This must be done as part of trade
or business or as undertaking analogous to trade or business. This element is completely missing in
a members’ club’ Why is the, club not an industry ? It involves cooperation of employer and
employees, organised like in a trade and calculated to, supply pleasurable utilities to members and
others. The learned Judge agrees that 'the material needs or wants of. a section of the community is
catered for but that is not enough. This must be done as part of trade or business or as an
undertaking analogous to trade or business. This element is completely missing in a members' club.

'This element’? What element makes it analogous to trade? Profit motive ? No, says the learned
judge. Because it is a self serving institution ? Yes ? Not at all. For, if it is self-service then why the
expensive establishment and staff with high salary bills ? It is plain as day-light that the club
members do nothing to produce the goods or services. They are rendered by employees who work
for wages. The members merely enjoy club life, the geniality of company and exhilarating
camaraderie, to the accompaniment of dinners, dance, games and thrills. The 'reason’ one may
discover is that it is a members’ club in the sense that 'the club belongs to members for the time
being on its, list of members and that is what matters. Those members can deal with the club as they
like. Therefore, the club is identified with its members at a given point of time. Thus, it cannot be
said that the club has an existence apart from the members’.

We are intrigued by this reason. The ingredients necessary for an industry are present here and yet
it is declared a non-industry because the club belongs to members only. A company belongs to the
shareholders only; a co-operative belongs to the share members only; a firm of experts belongs to
the partners only. And yet, if they employ workmen with whose co-oppration goods and services are
made available to a section of the community and the operations are organised in the manner
typical of business method and Organisation, the conclusion is irresistible that an ‘industry’
emerges. Likewise, the members of a club may own the institution and become the em- ployers for
that reason. It is transcendental logic to jettison the inference, of an ‘industry’ from such a factual
situation on the ingenious plea that a club 'belongs to members for the time being and that is what
matters’. We are inclined to think that that just does not matter. The Gymkhana case, we
respectfully hold, is wrongly decided. The Cricket Club of India(1) stands in a worse position. It is a
huge undertaking with activities wide-ranging, with big budgets, army of staff and profit-making
adventures. Indeed, the,members' share in the gains of these adventures by getting money'sworth by
cheaper accommodation, free or low priced tickets forentertainment and concessional refreshments;
and yet Bhargava J,speaking for the Court held this mammoth industry a non-Industry.Why' is the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 61Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

promotion of sports and games by itself a legal reason for excluding the organisation from the
category of industries if all the necessary ingredients are present? Is the fact that the residential
facility is exclusive for members an exemptive factor? Do not the members share in the profits
through the invisible process of lower charges ? When all these services are rendered by hired
employees, how can the nature of the activity be described as self-service, without taking liberty with
reality ? A number of utilities which have money's worth, are derived by the members. An indefinite
section of the community entering as the guests of the members also share in these services. The
testimony of the activities can leave none in doubt that this colossal 'club' is a vibrant collective
undertaking which offers goods and services to a section of the community for payment and there is
co-operation between employer and employees in this project. The plea of non-industry is
unpresentable and exclusion is possible only by straining law to snapping point to salvage a certain
class of socialite establishments. Presbyter is only priest writ large. club is industry manu brevi.

Co-operatives.

Co-operative societies ordinarily cannot, we feel, fall outside Sec. 2 (j) After all, the society, a legal
person, is the employer. The members and/or others are employees and the activity partakes of the
nature of trade. Merely because Co-operative enterprises deserve State encouragement the
definition cannot be distorted. Even if the society is worked by the members only, the entity (save
where they are few and self-serving) is an industry because the member- workers are paid wages
and there can be disputes about rates and different scales of wages among the categories i.e. workers
and workers or between workers and employer. These societies edit societies, marketing
Co-operatives, , producers’ or consumers’ societies or apex societies-are industries.

Do credit unions, organised on a cooperative basis, scale the definitional walls of industry ? They do.
The judgment of the Australian High Court in The Queen v. Marshall Ex Parte Federated Clerks
Union (1) [1969] 1S.C.R. 600.

of Australia(1) helps reach this conclusion. There, a credit union, which was a co-operative
association which pooled the savings of small people and made loans to its members at low interest,
was considered from the point of view of industry. Admittedly, they were credit unions incorporated
as co-operative societies and the thinking of Mason J., was that such institutions were industrial in
character. The industrial mechanism of society according to Starke J, included "all those bodies 'of
men associated, in various degrees of competition and cooperation, to win their living by providing
the community with some service which it requires' Mason J., went a step further to hold that even
if such credit unions were an adjunct of industry, they could be regarded as industry.

It is enough, therefore, if the activities carried on by credit unions can accurately be described as
incidental to industry or to the organized production, transportation or distribution of commodities
or other forms of material wealth. To our minds the evidence admits of no doubt that the activities
of credit unions are incidental in this sense.

This was sufficient, in his view, to conclude that credit unions constituted an industry under an Act
which has resemblance to our own. In our view, therefore, societies are industries.

The Safdarjung Hospital Case.

A sharp bend in the course of the Law came when Safdarjung was decided. The present reference
has come from that land mark case and, necessarily, it claims our close attention’ Even so, no
lengthy discussion is called for, because the connotation of ‘industry’ has already been given by us at
sufficient length to demarcate out deviation from the decision in Safdarjung.

Hidayatullah C. J., considered the facts of the appeals clubbed together there and held that all the
three institutions in the bunch of appeals were not industries. Abbreviated reasons were given for
the holding in regard to each institution, which we may extract for precise understanding :

"It is obvious that Safdarjung Hospital is not embarked on an economic activity
which can be said to be analogous to trade or business. There is no evidence that it is
more than a place where persons can get treated. This is a part of the functions of
Government and the Hospital is run as a Department of Government. It cannot,
therefore, be said to be an industry.

The Tuberculosis Hospital is not an independent institution. It is a part of the
Tuberculosis Association of India. The hospital is wholly charitable and is a research
institute. The dominant purpose of the Hospital is research and training, but as
research and training cannot be given without beds in a hospital, the hospital is, run.

Treatment is thus a part of research and training. In these circumstances th e Tuberculosis Hospital
cannot be described as industry.

(1) [1975] 132 C.L.R. 595.

The objects of the Kurji Holy Family Hospital are entirely charitable. It carries on work of training
research and treatment. Its income is mostly from donations and distribution of surplus as profit. is
prohibited. It is, therefore, clear that it is not an industry as laid down in the Act." Even a cursory
glance makes it plain that the learned Judge took the view that a place of treatment of patients, run
as a department of government, was not an industry because it was a part of the functions of the
government. We cannot possibly agree that running a hospital, which is a welfare activity and not a
sovereign function, cannot be an industry. Likewise, dealing with the Tuberculosis Hospital case, the
learned Judge held that the hospital was wholly charitable and also was a research institute.
Primarily, it was an institution for research and training. therefore, the Court concluded, the
institution could not be described as industry. Non sequitur.’ Hospital facility, research products
and training services are surely services and hence industry It is difficult to agree that a hospital is
not an industry. In the third case the same factors plus the prohibition of profit are relied on by the
Court. We find it difficult to hold that absence of, profit, ,or functions. of training and research, take
the institution out of the scope of industry.

Although the facts of the three appeals considered in Safdarjung related only to hospitals with
research and training component, the bench went extensively into a survey of the earlier precedents

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 63Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

and crystallisation of criteria for designating industries. After stating that trade and business have a
wide connotation, Hidayatullah, C. J., took the view that professions must be excluded from the
ambit of industry; "A profession ordinarily is an occupation requiring intellectual skill, often
coupled with manual skill. Thus a teacher uses purely intellectual skill, while a painter uses both. In
any event, they ate not engaged in an occupation inwhich employers and employees cooperate in the
production orsale of commodities or arrangement for their production or sale or distribution and
their services cannot be described as material service". We are unable to agree with this rationale. It
is difficult to understand why a school or a painting institute or a studio which uses the services of
employees and renders the service to the community cannot be regarded as an industry. What is
more baffling is the subsequent string of reasons presented by the learned Judge :

"What is meant by 'material services' needs some explanation too. Material services
are not services which depend wholly or largely upon the contribution of professional
know- ledge kill or dexterity for the production of a result. Such services being given
individually and by individuals are services no doubt but not material services. Even
an establishment where many such operate cannot be said to convert their
professional services-into material services. Material services involve an activity
carried on through co-operation between employers and employers and employers to
provide the community with the use of something such as electricpower, water,
transportation maildelivery telephones and the like. In providing the services there
may be employment of trained men and even professional men but the emphasis is
not on what these men do but upon the productivity of a service organised as an
industry and commercially valuable. Thus the services of professional men involving
benefit to indivi- duals according to their needs, such as doctors, teachers, lawyers,
solicitors etc.

are easily distinguishable from an activity such as transport service. The latter is of a commercial
character in which something is brought into existence quite apart from the benefit to particular
individuals. It is the production of this something which is described as the production of material
services.’ With the greatest respect to the learned Chief Justice, the arguments strung together in
this paragraph are too numerous and subtle for us to imbibe. It is transcendental to define material
services as excluding professional services. We have explained this position at some length
elsewhere in this judgment and do 'not feel the need to repeat. Nor are we convinced that Gymkhana
and Cricket Club of India are correctly decided. The learned Judge placed accent on the non-profit
making members club as being outside the pale of trade or industry. We demur to this proposition.
Another intriguing reasoning in the judgment is that the Court has stated "it is not necessary that
there must be a profit motive but the enterprises must be analogous to trade or business in a
commercial sense". However, somewhat contrary to this reasoning we find, in the concluding part of
the judgment, emphasis on the non-profit making aspect of the institutions. Equally puzzling is the
reference to "commercial sense" what precisely doer, this expression mean ? It is interesting to note
that the word "commercial" has more than one semantic shade. If it means profit-making, the
reasoning is self,contradictory. If it merely means a commercial pattern of organisation, of hiring
and firing employees, of indicating the nature of employer-employee, relation as in trade or
commercial house, then the activity oriented approach is the correct one. On that footing, the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 64Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

conclusions reached in that case do not follow. As a matter of fact, Hidayatullah, C.J., bad in
Gymkhana turned down, the test of commerciality : "Trade is only one aspect of industrial
ACTIVITY.......... cee This requires co- operation in some form between employers and workmen and
the result is directly the product of this association but not necessarily commercial". Indeed, while
dealing with the reasoning in Hospital Mazdoor Sabha he observes : "If a hospital, nursing home or
a dispensary is ran as a business, in a commercial way, there may be found elements of an industry
there". This facet suggests either profit motive, which ‘has, been expressly negatived in the very case,
or commercial-type of activity, regardless of profit, which affirms the test which we have accepted,
namely, that there must be employer--employee relations more or less on the pattern of trade or
business. All that we can say is that there are different. strands of reasoning in the judgment which
are somewhat difficult to, reconcile. Of course, when the, learned judge states that the use of the first
schedule to the Act depends on the condition precedent of the existence of an industry, we agree..
But, that by itself does not mean that a hospital cannot be regarded as an industry, profit-or no
profit, research or no research. We have adduced enough reasons in the various portions of this
judgment to regard hospitals, research institutions and training centres as valuable material services
to the community, qualifying for coming within sec. 2(j). We must plainly state that vis-a- vis
hospitals, Safdarjung was wrong and Hospital Mazdoor Sabha was right.

Because of the problems of reconciliation of apparently contradictory stands of reasoning in
Safdarjung we find, subsequent cases of' this Court striking different notes. In fact, one of us
(Bhagwati J.), in Indian Standards Institution (1) referred, even at the opening, to the baffling,
perplexing question which, judicial ventures had not solved. We fully endorse the observations of
the Court in LS.I. :

"So infinitely varied and many-sided is human activity and with the incredible growth
and progress in all branches of knowledge and ever widening areas of experience at
all levels, it is becoming so diversified and expanding in so. many directions hitherto
unthought of, that no rigid and doctrinaire approach can be adopted in considering
this question. Such an approach would fail to measure up to the needs of the growing
welfare state which is constantly engaged in undertaking new and varied activities as
part of its social welfare policy. The concept of industry, which is intended to be a
convenient and effective tool in the hands of industrial adjudication for bringing
about industrial peace and harmony, would lose its capacity for adjustment and
change. It would be petrified and robbed of its dynamic content. The Court should,
therefore, so far as possible avoid formulating or adopting generalisations and
hesitate to cast the concept of industry in a narrow rigid mould which would not
permit of expansion as and when necessity arises. Only some working principles may
be evolved which would furnish guidance in determining what are the attributes or
characteristics which would ordinarily indicate that an undertaking is analogous to
trade or business".

Our endeavour in this decision is to provide such working principles. This Court, within a few years
of the enactment of the salutary statute, explained the benign sweep of 'industry' in Banerji which

served’ as beacon in later years Ahmedabad Textile Research acted on it, Hospital Mazdoor Sabha

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 65Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

and Nagpur Corporation marched in its sheen. The law shed steady light on industrial
inter-relations and the country's. tribunals and courts settled down to evolve a progressive labour
jurisprudence, burying the bad memories of laissez faire and bitter struggles.

(1) [1976] 2 S.C.R. 138.

in this field and nourishing new sprouts of legality fertilised by the seminal ratio in Banerji Indeed,
every great judgment is not merely an adjudication of an existing lis but an appeal addressed by the
present to the emerging future. And here the future responded, harmonising with the human escape
hopefully projected by Part IV of the Consti- tution. But the drama of a nation's life, especially when
it confronts die-hard forces, develops situations of imbroglio and tendencies to back-track. And Law
quibbles where Life wobbles. Judges only read signs and translate symbols in the national sky. So
ensued An era of islands of exception dredged up by judicial process. Great clubs were privileged
out, liberal professions swam to safety, educa- tional institutions, vast and small, were helped out,
divers charities, ,disinclined to be charitable to their own weaker workmen, made pious pleas and
philanthropic appeals to be extricated. A procession of decisions Solicitors’ case, University of Delhi,
Gymkhana Club, Cricket 'Club of India (supra) Chartered Accountants(1) climaxed by Safdarjung,
carved out sanctuaries. The six-member bench-the largest which sat on this court conceptually to
reconstruct ‘industry’, affirmed and reversed, held profit motive irrelevant but upheld charitable
service ,aS exemptive, and in its lights and shadows, judicial thinking became ambivalent and
industrial jurisprudence landed itself in a legal quagmire. Pinjrapoles sought salvation and
succeeded in principle (.Bombay Panjrapole), Chambers of, Commerce fought and failed, hospitals
battled to victory (Dhanrajgirji Hospital), standards institute made a vain bid to extricate (1.8.1.
Case), research institutes,. at the High Court level, waged and won non-industry status in Madras
and Kerala. The murky legal sky paralysed tribunals and courts and administration and then came,
in consequence, this reference to a larger bench of seven judges. Banerji, 'amplified by Corporation
of Nagpur, in effect met with its Waterloo in Safdarjung. But in this latter case two voices could be
heard and subsequent rulings zigzaged and conflicted precisely because of this built-in ambivalence.
It behaves us, therefore, hopefully to abolish blurred edges, illumine penumbral areas and over-rule
what we regard as wrong. Hesitancy, half-tones and hunting with the hounds and running with the
hare can claim heavy penalty in the shape of industrial confusion, adjudicatory quandary and
administrative perplexity at a time when the nation is striving to promote employment through
diverse strategies which need for their smooth fulfillment, less stress and distress, more mutual
understanding and trust based on a dynamic rule of law which speaks clearly, firmly and humanely.
If the salt of law lose its savour of progressive certainty wherewith shall it be salted ? So we proceed
to formulate the principles, deducible from our discussion, which are decisive, positively and
negatively, of the identity of ‘industry’ under the Act. We speak, not exhaustively but to the extent
covered by the debate at the bar and, to that extent, authoritatively, until over-ruled by a larger
bench or superseded by the legislative branch. (1) [1963] 1 L.L.J. 567 (culcutta).

1. Industry’, as defined in Sec, 2 (j) and explained hi Banerji, has a wide import.

(a) Where (i) systematic activity, (11) organized by co- operation between employer and employee,
(the direct and substantial element is chimerical) (iii) for the production and/or distribution of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 66Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

goods and services calculated to satisfy human wants and wishes (not spiritual or religious but
inclusive of material things or services geared to, celestial bliss e.g. making, on a large scale, prasad
or food), prima facie, there is an 'industry' in that enterprise.

(b) Absence of profit motive or gainful objective is irrelevant, be the venture in the public, joint
private or other sector.

(c) The true focus is functional and the decisive test is the nature of the activity with special
emphasis on the employer-employee relations.

(d) If the Organisation is a trade or business, it does not cease to, be one because of philanthropy
animating the undertaking.

11. Although sec. 2(j) uses, words of the widest amplitude in its two limbs, their meaning cannot be
magnified to overreach itself.

(a) ‘Undertaking’ must suffer a contextual and associational shrinkage as explained in Banerji and in
this judgment, so also, service, calling and the like. This yields the inference that all organized
activity possessing the triple elements in I (supra), although not trade or business, may still be
‘industry’ (provided the nature of the activity, viz. the employer-employee basis, bears resemblance
to what we find in trade or business. This takes into the- fold of 'industry' undertakings, callings and
services adventure ‘analogous to the carrying on of trade or business’. All features, other than the
methodology of carrying on the activity viz. in organizing the co-operation between employer and
employee may be dissimilar. It does not matter, if off the employment terms there is analogy.

III. Application of these guidelines should not stop short of their logical reach by invocation of
creeds, cults or inner sense of incongruity or other sense of motivation for or resultant of the
economic operations. The ideology of the Act being industrial peace, regulation and resolution of
industrial disputes between employer and workmen, the range of this statutory ideology must
inform the reach of the statutory definition. Nothing less, nothing mom.

(a) The consequences are (i) professions, (11) Clubs (aii) educational institutions (ilia) co-operatives,
(iv) research institutes (v) charitable projects and (vi) other kindred adventures, if they fulfil the
triple tests listed in I (supra), cannot be exempted from the scope of sec. 2 (j).

(b) A restricted category of professions, clubs, co- operatives and even Gurukulas and little research
labs, may qualify for exemption if in simple ventures substantially and going by the dominant nature
criterion substantatively, in single simple ventures, no employees are entertained but in minimal
matters, marginal employees are hired without destroying the non- employee character of the unit.

(c) If in a pious or altruistic mission many employ them- selves, free or for small honoraria, or likely
return mainly by sharing in the purpose or cause, such as lawyers volunteering to run a free legal
services clinic or doctors serving in their spare hours in a free medical centre or ashramites working
at the bidding of the holiness, divinity or like central personality and the services are supplied free or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 67Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

at nominal cost and those who serve are not engaged for remuneration or on the basis of master and
servant, relationship, then, the institution is not an industry even if stray servants, manual or
technical, are hired. Such eleemosynary or like undertakings alone are exempt-not other generosity,
compassion, developmental passion or project. IV The dominant nature test :

(a) where a complex of activities, some of which qualify for exemption others not, involves
employees on the total undertaking, some of whom are not 'workmen' as in the University of Delhi
Case or some departments are not productive of goods and services if isolated, even then, the
predominant nature of the services and the integrated nature of the departments as explained in the
Corporation of Nagpur, will be true test. The whole, undertaking will be ‘industry’ although those
who are not 'workmen' by definition may not benefit by the status.

(b) Notwithstanding the previous clauses, sovereign functions, strictly understood, alone qualify for
exemption, not the welfare activities or economic adventures undertaken by government or
statutory bodies.

(c) Even in departments discharging sovereign functions, if there are units which are industries and
they are Substantially severable, then they can be considered to come within sec. 2(j).

(d) Constitutional and competently enacted legislative provisions may well remove from the scope of
the Act categories which otherwise may be covered thereby. We over-rule Safdarjung, Solicitors'
case, Gymkhana, Delhi University, Dhanrajgirji Hospital and other rulings whose ratio runs counter
to the principles enunciated above, and Hospital Mazdoor Sabha is hereby rehabilitated. We
conclude with diffidence because Parliament which has the commitment to the political nation to
legislate promptly in vital areas like industry and trade and articulate the welfare expectations in the
conscience’ portion of the constitution, has hardly intervened to restructure the rather clumsy,
vaporous and tall-aud-dwarf definition or tidy up the scheme although Judicial thesis and
anti-thesis, disclosed in the two decades long decisions, should have produced a legislative synthesis
becoming of a welfare State and Socialistic Society, in a world setting where I.L.O. norms are
advancing and India needs updating. We feel confident, in another sense, since counsel stated at the
bar that a bill on the subject is in the offing. The rule of law, we are sure, will run with the rule of
Life-Indian Life-at the threshold of the decade of new development in which Labour and Management, guided by the State, will constructively partner the better production and fair diffusion of
national wealth. We have stated that, save the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board-appeal,
we are not disposing of the others on the merits. We dismiss that appeal with costs and direct that

ORDER We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed by Krishna Iyer, J. in his critical
judgment that the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board appeal should be dismissed. We will
give our reasons later indicating the area of concurrence and divergence, if any, on the various
points in controversy on which our learned Brother has dwelt. CHANDRACHUD, C. J.-By a short
order dated February 21, 1978, which I pronounced on behalf of myself and my learned Brethren'
Jaswant Singh and Tulzapurkar, I had expressed our agreement with the view taken--by Brother

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 68Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

Krishna lyer on behalf of himself and three other learned Brethren that the Bangalore Water Supply
& Sewerege Board's appeal be dismissed. I had stated that the area of concurrence or divergence
with the rest of the judgment will, if necessary, be indicated later.

I have now the added advantage of knowing the divergent view expressed by Jaswant Singh and
Tulzapurkar, JJ. on certain aspects of the matter. Almost every possible nuance of the question as to
what is comprehended within "Industry" and what ought to be excluded from the sweep of that
expression has received consideration in the two judgments. Having given a further thought to the
frustrating question as to what falls within and without the statutory concept of 'industry' I am
unable to accept, respectfully, the basis on which Jaswant Singh and Tulzapurkar, JJ. have
expressed their dissent.

Section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, defines 'industry' to mean
"any business, trade, undertaking, manufacture or calling of employers and includes
any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of
work- men".

These are words of wide import' as wide as the legislature could have possibly made them. The first
question which has engaged the attention of every court which is called upon to consider whether a
parti
cular activity is ‘industry’ is whether, the definition should be permitted to have its full sway
embracing within its wide sweep every activity which squarely falls within its terms or whether,
some limitation ought not be read into the definition so as to restrict its, scope as reasonably as one
may, without doing violence to the supposed intention of the legislature. An attractive argument
based on a well- known principle of statutory interpretation is often advanced in support of the
latter view. That principle is known as 'noscitur a sociis' by which is meant that associated words
take their meaning from. one another. That is to say, when two or more words which are susceptible
of analogous meaning are coupled together, they take their colour from each other so that the width
of the more general words may square with that of words of lesser generality. An argument based on
this principle was rejected by Gajendragadkar, J., while speaking on behalf of the Court, in State of
Bombay & Others v. The Hospital Mazdoor Sabha & Others(1). A group of five hospitals called the J.
J. Hospital, Bombay, which is run and managed by the State Government in order to provide
medical relief and to promote the health of the people was held in that case to be an industry.

The Court expressed its opinion in a characteristically clear tone by saying that if the object and
scope of the Industrial Disputes Act are considered, there would be no difficulty in holding that the
relevant words of wide import have been deliberately used by the legislature in defining ‘industry’ in
section 2 (j) of the Act. The object of the Act, the Court said, was to make, provision for the
investigation and settlement of industrial disputes, and the extent and scope of its provisions would
be realised if one were to bear in mind the definition of ‘industrial dispute’ given by s. 2(k), of
'wages' by s. 2(rr), 'workman’' by s. 2(s), and of ‘employer by s. 2(g). The Court also thought that in
deciding whether the State was running an industry, the definition of 'public utility service’

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 69Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

prescribed by section 2(n) was very significant and one bid merely to glance at the six categories of
public utility services mentioned therein to realise that in running the hospitals the State was
running an industry. "It is the character of the activity which I decides the question as to whether
the activity in question attracts the provision of section 2(j); who conducts the 'activity", said the
Court. "-and whether it is conducted for profit or not do not make a material difference.

But having thus expressed its opinion in a language which left no doubt as to its meaning, I the
Court went on to observe that though section 2(j) used words of a very wide denotation, "It is clear"
that a line, would have to be drawn in a fair and just manner so as to exclude some callings, services
or undertakings from the scope, of the definition. This was considered ‘necessary because if all the
words used in the definition were given their widest meaning, all services and all callings would
come within the purview of the definition including services rendered by a person in a purely
personal or domestic capacity or in a casual manner. The Court then undertook for examination (1)
[1960] 2 S.C.R. 866.

what it euphemistically called "a somewhat difficult' problem to decide and it proceeded to, draw a
line in order to ascertain what limitations could and should be reasonably implied in interpreting
the wide words used in section 2(j). I consider, with great respect, that the problem is far too
policy-oriented to be satisfactorily settled by judicial decisions. The Parliament; must step in and
legislate in a manner which will leave no doubt as to its intention. That alone can afford a
satisfactory solution to the question which has agitated and perplexed the judiciary at all levels.

In the Hospital Mazdoor Sabha (supra) the Court rejected, on concession, two possible limitation on
the meaning of 'industry' as defined in section 2(j) of the Act : firstly, that no activity can be an
industry unless accompanied by a profit motive and secondly, that investment of capital is
indispensable for treating an activity as an industry.,, The Court also rejected, on examination, the
limitation that a quid pro quo for services rendered is necessary for bringing an activity within the
terms of section 2(j). If the absence of profit motive was immaterial, the activity, according to the
Court, could not be excluded from section 2(j) merely because the person responsible for the
conduct of the activity accepted no return and was actuated by philanthropic or charitable motives.
The Court ultimately drew a line at the point where the regal or sovereign activity of the Government
is undertaken and held that such activities of the Government as have been pithily described by Lord
Watson as "the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional Government", could be stated
negatively as falling outside the scope of section 2(j). The judgment concludes with the summing-up
that, as a working principle, an activity systematically or habitually undertaken for the production or
distribution of goods or for the rendering of material services to the community at large or a part of
such community with the help of employees is an. undertaking within the meaning; of section 2(j);that such an, activity generally involves the co-operation of the employer and the employees; that
the activity must not be casual nor must it be for oneself nor for pleasure, but it must be organised
or arranged in a armor in which trade or business is generally organised; and thus,- the manner in
which an activity is organised or arranged and the, form and the effectiveness of the cooperation
between the employer and employee for producing a desired result and for rendering of material
services to. the community become distinctive of activities falling within the terms of 'section 2(j).
Seeds of, many a later judgment were sown by, these imitations which were carved out by the Court

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 70Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

in order to reduce the width of a definition which was earlier described as having been deli- berately
couched by the legislature in words of the widest amplitude.

These exceptions which the Court engrafted, upon the definition of ‘industry’ in section 2(j) in order
to give to the definition the merit of, reasonableness, became in course of time as many categories of
activities exempted from the operation of the definition clause. To an extent., it seems to me clear
that though the decision in Hospital’ Mazdoor Sabha (supra) that a Government run hospital was an
industry proceeded upon the rejection of the test of 'noscitur a sociis, it is this very principle which
constitutes the rationale of the exceptions carved out by the Court. It was said that the principle of
‘noscitur a sociis' is applicable in cases of doubt and since the language of the definition admitted of
no doubt, the principle had no application. But if the language was clear, the definition had to be
given the meaning which the words convey and there can be no scope for seeking exceptions. The
contradiction, with great respect, is that the Court rejected the test of ‘association of words' while
deciding whether the Government-run hospital is an industry but accepted that very test while
indicating which categories of activities would fall outside the definition. The question then is : If
there is no doubt either as to the meaning of the words used by the legislature in section 2(j) or on
the question that these are words of amplitude, what justification can one seek for diluting the
concept of industry as envisaged by the legislature ?

On a careful consideration of the question I am of the opinion that Hospital Mazdoor Sabha was
correctly decided in so far as it held that the J. J. group of hospitals was an industry but,
respectfully, the same, cannot be said in regard to the view of the Court that certain activities ought
to be treated as falling outside the definition clause.

One of the exceptions carved out by the Court is in favour of activities undertaken by the
Government in the exercise of its inalienable functions under the Constitution, call it regal,
sovereign or by any other name. I see no justification for excepting these categories of public utility
activities from the definition of 'industry’. If it be true that one must have. regard to the nature of the
activity and not to who engages in it, it seems to me beside the point to enquire whether the activity
is undertaken by the State, and further, if so., whether it is undertaken in fulfilment of the State's
constitutional obligations or in discharge of its constitutional functions; In fact, to concede- the
benefit of an exception to the State's activities which are in the nature of sovereign functions is really
to have regard not so much to the nature of the activity as to the consideration who engages in that
acti- vity; for, sovereign functions can only be discharged by the State and not by a private person. If
the State's inalienable functions are excepted from the sweep of the definition contained in section
2(j), one shall have unwittingly rejected the fundamental test that it is the nature of the activity
which ought to determine whether the activity is an industry. Indeed, in this respect,. it should make
no difference whether, on the one hand, an activity is undertaken by a corporate body in. the
discharge of its statutory functions or, on. the other, by the State itself in the exercise of its
inalienable functions. If the water supply and sewerage schemes or fire fighting establishments run
by a Municipality can be industries, so ought to be the manufacture of coins and currency, arms and
ammunition and the winning of oil and uranium. The fact that these latter kinds of activities are, or
can only be, undertaken by the State does not furnish any answer to the question whether these
activities are industries. When undertaken by a private individual they are industries. Therefore,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 71Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

when undertaken by the State, they are industries. The nature of the activity is the determining
factor and that does not change according to who undertakes it. Items 8, 11, 12, 17 and 18 of the First
Schedule read with section 2(n)(vi) of the Industrial Disputes Act render support to this view. These
provisions which were described in Hospital Mazdoor Sabha as 'very significant’ at least show that,
conceivably, a Defence Establishment, a Mint or.a Security Press can be an industry even though
these acti- vities are, ought to be and can only be undertaken by the State in the discharge of its
constitutional obligations or functions. The State does not trade when it prints a currency note or
strikes a coin. And yet, considering the nature of the activity, it is engaged in an industry when it
does so.

That leads to the consideration whether charitable enterprises can at all be industries. Viewing the
problem from the angle from which one must, according to me, view the State's inalienable
functions, it seems to me to follow logically that a systematic activity which is organised or arranged
in a manner in which trade or business is generally organised or arranged would be an industry
despite the fact that it proceeds from charitable motives. It is the nature of the activity that one has
to consider and it is upon the application of that test that the State's inalienable functions fall within
the definition of 'industry'. The very same principle must yield the result that just as the
consideration as to who conducts an activity is irrelevant for determining whether the activity is an
industry, so is the fact that the activity is charitable in nature or is undertaken with a charitable
motive. The status or capacity, corporate or constitutional, of the employer would have, if at all,
closer nexus, than his motive, with the question whether the activity is an industry. And yet that
circumstance, according to me, cannot affect the decision of the question. The motive which propels
an activity is yet another step removed and, ex hypothesi, can have no relevance on the question as
to what is the nature of the activity. It is never true to say that the nature of an activity is charitable.
The subjective motive force of an activity can be charity but for the purpose of deciding whether an
activity is an industry one has to look at the process involved in the activity, objectively. The
argument that he who does charity is not doing trade or business misses the point because the true
test is whether the acti- vity, considered objectively, is organised or arranged in a manner in which
trade or business is normally organised or arranged. If so, the activity would be an industry no
matter whether the employer is actuated by charitable motives in undertaking it. The jural
foundation of any attempt to except charitable enterprises from the scope of the definition can only
be that such enterprises are not undertaken for profit. But then that, clearly, is to introduce the
profit-concept by a side wind, a concept which, I suppose, has been rejected consistently over the
years. If any principle can be said to be settled law in this vexed field it is this : the twin
consideration of profit motive and capital investment is irrelevant for determining whether an
activity is an industry. Therefore, activities which are dominated by charitable motives, either in the
sense that they involve the rendering of free or near-free services or in the sense that the profits
which they yield are diverted to charitable purposes, are not beyond the pale of the definition in
section 2(j). It is as much beside the point to in
quire who is the employer as it is to inquire why is the activity undertaken and what the employer
does with his profits, if any.

Judged by these tests, I find myself unable to accept the broad formulation that a Solicitor's
establishment cannot be an industry. A Solicitor, undoubtedly, does not carry on trade or business
when he acts for his client or advises him or pleads for him, if and when pleading is permissible to
him. He pursues a profession which is variously and justifiably described as learned, liberal or
noble, But, with great respect, I find it difficult to infer from the language of the definition in section
2(j), as was done by this Court in The National Union of Commercial Employees and Another v. M.
R. Meher, Industrial Tribunal, Bombay and Others,(1) that the legislature could not have intended
to bring a liberal profession like that of an attorney within the ambit of the definition of industry. In
Hospital Mazdoor Sabha (supra) the Court while evolving a working principle stated that an
industrial activity generally involves, inter alia, the cooperation of the employer and the employee.
That the production of goods or the rendering of material services to the community must be the
direct and proximate result of such cooperation is a further extension of that principle and it is
broadly by the application thereof that a Solicitor's establishment is held not to attract the definition
clause. These refinements are, with respect, not warranted by the words of the definition, apart from
the consideration that in practice they make the application of the definition to concrete cases
dependent upon a factual assessment so highly subjective as to lead to confusion and uncertainty in
the understanding of the true legal position. Granting that the language of the definition is so wide
that some limitation ought to be read into it, one must stop at a point beyond which the definition
will skid into a domain too rarefied to be realistic. Whether the cooperation between the employer
and the employee is the proximate cause of the ultimate product and bears direct nexus with it is a
test which is almost impossible of application with any degree of assurance or certitude. It will be as
much true to say that the Soli- citor's Assistant, Managing Clerk, Librarian and the Typist do not
directly contribute to the intellectual end product which is a creation of his personal professional
skill as that, without their active assistance and cooperation it will be impossible for him to function
effectively. The unhappily state of affairs in which the law is marooned will continue to baffle the
skilled professional and his employees alike as also the Judge who has to perform the unenviable
task of sitting in judgment over the directness of the cooperation between the employer and the
employee, until such time as the legislature decides to manifest its intention by the use of clear and
indubious language. Beside the fact that this Court has so held in National Union of Commercial
Employees, (supra) the legislature will find a plausible case for exempting the learned and liberal
professions of Lawyers, Solicitors, Doctors, Engineers, Chartered Accountants and the like from the,
operation of industrial laws. But until that happens, I consider that in the present state of the law it
is difficult by Judicial interpretation to create exemptions in favour of any particular class.

(1) [1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 157.

The case of the clubs, on the present definition, is weaker still; and not only do I consider that the
definition squarely covers them, except to the limited extent indicated by Brother Krishna Iyer in his
judgment, but I see no justification for amending the law so as to exclude them from the operation
of the industrial laws. The fact that the running of clubs is not a calling of the club or its managing
committee, that the club has no existence apart from its members, that it exists for its members
though occasionally strangers also take the benefit of its services and that even with the admission
of guests the club remains a members' self-serving institution, seems to me, with respect, not to
touch the core of the problem. And the argument that the activity of the clubs cannot be described as

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 73Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

trade or business or manufacture overlooks, with respect, that the true test can only be whether the
activity is organised or arranged in a manner in which a trade or business is normally organised or
arranged. I have already said enough on that question.

On the remaining aspects of the case I have nothing useful to add to the penetrating analysis of the
problem made by Brother Krishna Iyer in his judgment.

JASWANT SINGH, J. It may be recalled that in the order dated February 21, 1978 pronounced by
our learned brother, Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) on 'behalf of himself, brother Tulzapurkar
and myself, expressing our respectful agreement with the view expressed by our learned brother
Krishna Iyer that the Bangalore Water Supply & Sewerage Board appeal be dismissed, it was stated
that we would indicate the area of concurrence and divergence, if any, later on. Accordingly, we
proceed to do that now. The definition of the term "industry" as contained in Section 2(j) of the
Industrial Disputes Act which is in two parts being vague and too wide as pointed out by Beg, C.J.
and Krishna lyer, J., we have struggled to find out its true scope and ambit in the light of plethora of
decisions of this Court which have been laying down fresh tests from time to time making our task
an uphill one. However, bearing in mind the collocation of the terms in which the definition is
couched and applying the doctrine of noscitur a sociis (which, as pointed out by this Court in State
of Bombay & Ors. v. The Hospital Mazdoor Sabha & Ors.(1) means that, when two or more words
which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled together they are understood to be used in
their cognate sense. They take as it were their colour from each other, that is, the, more general is
restricted to a sense analogous to a less general. Expressed differentlY, it means that the meaning of
a doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it, we are
of the view that despite the width of the definition it could not be the intention of the Legislature
that categories 2 and 3 of the charities alluded to by our learned brother Krishna Iyer in his
judgment, hospital run on charitable basis or as a part of the functions of the Government or local
bodies like municipalities and educational and research institutions (1) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 866.

whether run by private entities or by Government and liberal and learned professions like that of
doctors, lawyers and teachers, the pursuit of which is dependent upon an individual's own
education, intellectual attainments and special expertise should fall within the pale of the definition.
We are inclined to think that the definition is limited to those activities systematically or habitually
undertaken on commercial lines by private entrepreneurs with the cooperation of employees for the
production or distribution of goods, or for the rendering of material services to the community at
large or a part of such community. It is needless to emphasise that in the case of liberal professions,
the contribution of the usual type of employees employed by the professionals to the value of the end
product (viz. advice and services rendered to the client) is so marginal that the end product cannot
be regarded as the fruit of the cooperation between the pro- fessional'and his employees.

It may be pertinent to mention in this connection that the need for excluding some callings, services
and undertakings from the purview of the aforesaid definition has been felt and recognised by this
Court from time to time while explaining the scope of the definition of "industry". This is evident
from the observations made by this Court in State of Bombay & Ors. v. The Hospital Mazdoor Sabha
& Ors. (supra), Secretary, Madras Gymkhana Club Employees Union v. 'Management of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1 149369/ 74Bangalore Water-Supply & ... vs R. Rajappa & Others on 21 February, 1978

Gymkhana Club(1) and Management of Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi V. Kuldip Singh Sethi (2).
Speaking for the Bench in State of Bombay & Ors. v. The Hospital Mazdoor Sabha & Ors. (supra),
Gajendragadkar, J. (as he then was) observed in this connection thus :

"It is clear, however, that though s. 2(j) uses words of very wide denotation, a line
would have to be drawn in a fair and just manner so as to exclude some callings,
services or undertakings. If all the words used are given their widest meaning, all
services and all callings would come within the purview of the definition; even service
rendered by a servant purely in a personal or domestic matter or even in a casual way
would fall within the definition. It is not and cannot be suggested that in its wide
sweep the word "Service" is intended to include service however rendered in
whatsoever capacity and for whatsoever reason. We must, therefore, consider where
the line should be drawn and what limitations can and should be reasonably implied
in interpreting the wide words used in s. 2(j); and that no doubt is a somewhat
difficult problem to decide."

(1) [1968] 1S.C.R. 742.

(2) [1971] 1S.C.R. 177.

In view of the difficulty experienced by all of us in defining the true denotation of the term
"industry" and divergence of opinion in regard thereto-as has been the case with this bench also-we
think, it is high time that the Legislature steps in with a comprehensive bill to clear up the fog and
remove the doubts and set at rest once for all the controversy which crops up from time to time in
relation to the meaning of the aforesaid term rendering it necessary for larger benches of this Court
to be, constituted which are driven to the necessity of evolving a working formula to cover particular
cases.

Reference No. 1 of 1993 (hereinafter referred to as "the Special Reference") made by the President of
India under Article 143(1) of the Constitution of India are the questions for decision herein. The

4. Certain undisputed facts emerging at the hearing may also have relevance for this purpose. These
questions are answered on this basis, eschewing facts which are in the area of controversy and have
yet to be adjudicated.

BACKGROUND

5. The Bill was introduced in Parliament leading to the above enactment and the said Reference to
this Court was made in the historical background set out in the White Paper. Indeed, the two
simultaneous acts are an indication of the legislative intent for enactment of the statute, the
reference being made as a part of the same exercise with a view "to effectuate the purpose of the
enactment. This is how, they have to be viewed.

6. The "Overview" at the commencement of the White Paper in Chapter 1 states thus:
1.1 Ayodhya situated in the north of India is a township in District Faizabad of Uttar Pradesh. It has
long been a place of holy pilgrimage because of its mention in the epic Ramayana as the place of
birth of Shri Ram. The structure commonly known as Ram Janma Bhoomi-Babri Masjid was erected
as a mosque by one Mir Baqi in Ayodhya in 1528 A.D. It is claimed by some sections that it was built
at the site believed to be the birth-spot of Shri Ram where a temple had stood earlier. This resulted
in a long-standing dispute.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37494799/ 1Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui Etc, Mohd. ... vs Union Of India And Others on 24 October, 1994

1.2 The controversy entered a new phase with the placing of idols in the disputed structure in
December, 1949. The premises were attached under Section 145 of the CrPC. Civil suits were filed
shortly thereafter. Interim orders in these civil suits restrained the parties from removing the idols
or interfering with their worship. In effect, therefore, from December, 1949 till December 6, 1992
the structure had not been used as a mosque.

7. The movement to construct a Ram-temple at the site of the disputed structure gathered
momentum in recent years which became a matter of great controversy and a source of tension. This
led to several parleys the details of which are not very material for the present purpose. These
parleys involving the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the All India Babri Masjid Action
Committee (AIBMAC), however, failed to resolve the dispute. A new dimension was added to the
campaign for construction of the temple with the formation of the Government in Uttar Pradesh in
June 1991 by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) which declared its commitment to the construction of
the temple and took certain steps like the acquisition of land adjoining the disputed structure while
leaving out the disputed structure itself from the acquisition. The focus of the temple construction
movement from October 1991 was to start construction of the temple by way of 'kar-sewa' on the
land acquired by the Government of Uttar Pradesh while leaving the disputed structure intact. This
attempt did not succeed and there was litigation in the Allahabad High Court as well as in this
Court. There was a call for resumption of kar sewa from 6th December, 1992 and the announcement
made by the organisers was for a symbolic kar sewa without violation of the court orders including
those made in the proceedings pending in this Court. In spite of initial reports from Ayodhya on 6th
December, 1992 indicating an air of normalcy, around mid-day a crowd addressed by leaders of BJP,
VHP, etc., climbed the Ram Janma Bhumi-Babri Masjid (RJB-BM) structure and started damaging
the domes. Within a short time, the entire structure was demolished and razed to the ground.
Indeed, it was an act of "national shame". What was demolished was not merely an ancient
structure; but "the faith of the minorities in the sense of justice and fair play of majority. It shook
their faith in the rule of law and constitutional processes. A five hundred year old structure which
was defenceless and whose safety was a sacred trust in the hands of the State Government was
demolished.

8. After referring to the details on this tragedy, the White Paper in Chapter 1 on "OVERVIEW"
concludes thus :
1.35. The demolition of the Ram Janma Bhoomi-Babri Masjid structure at Ayodhya on 6th
December, 1992 was a most reprehensible act. The perpetrators of this deed struck not only against
a place of worship, but also at the principles of secularism, democracy and the rule of law enshrined
in our Constitution. In a move as sudden as it was shameful, a few thousand people managed to
outrage the sentiments of millions of Indians of all communities who have reacted to this incident
with anguish and dismay.

1.36 What happened on December 6, 1992 was not a failure of the system as a whole, nor of the
wisdom inherent in India's Constitution, nor yet of the power of tolerance, brotherhood and
compassion that has so vividly informed the life of independent India. It was, the Supreme Court
observed on that day, "a great pity that a Constitutionally elected Government could not discharge

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37494799/ 2Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui Etc, Mohd. ... vs Union Of India And Others on 24 October, 1994

its duties in a matter of this sensitiveness and magnitude." Commitments to the Court and
Constitution, pledges to Parliament and the people, were simply cast aside. Therein lay the failure,
therein the betrayal.

1.37 Today India seeks to heal, and not reopen its wounds; to look forward with hope, and not
backwards with fear; to reconcile reason with faith. Above all, India is determined to press ahead
with the National Agenda, undeterred by aberrations.

9. It may be mentioned that a structure called the Ram-chabutra stood on the disputed site within
the courtyard of the disputed structure. This structure also was demolished on 6th December, 1992
(Appendix-V to the White Paper). Worship of the idols installed on the Ram-chabutra by Hindu
devotees in general, it appears, had been performed for a considerable period of time without any
objection by the Muslims to its worship at that place, prior to the shifting of the idols from the
Ram-chabutra to the disputed structure in December 1949. As a result of demolition of
Ram-chabutra also on 6th December 1992, the worship by Hindus in general even at that place was
interrupted. Thereafter, the worship of idols is being performed only by a priest nominated for the
purpose without access to the public.

10. A brief reference to certain suits in this connection may now be made. In 1950, two suits were
filed by some Hindus; in one of these suits in January 1950. the trial court passed interim orders
whereby the idols remained at the place where they were installed in December 1949 and their Puja
by the Hindus continued. The interim order was confirmed by the High Court in April 1955. On ist
February, 1986, the District Judge ordered the opening of the lock placed on a grill leading to the
sanctum-sanctorum of the shrine in the disputed structure and permitted Puja by the Hindu
devotees. In 1959, a suit was filed by the Nirmohi Akhara claiming title to the disputed structure. In
1961, another suit was filed claiming title to the disputed structure by the Sunni Central Wakf Board.
In 1989, Deoki Nandan Agrawal, as the next friend of the Deity filed a title suit in respect of the
disputed structure. In 1989, the aforementioned suits were transferred to the Allahabad High Court
and were ordered to be heard together. On 14th August, 1989. the High Court ordered the
maintenance of status quo in respect of the disputed structure (Appendix-I to the White Paper). As
earlier mentioned, it is stated in para 1.2 of the White Paper that:

interim orders in these civil suits restrained the parties from removing the idols or interfering with
their worship. In effect, therefore, from December, 1949 till December 6, 1992 the structure had not
been used as a mosque.

11. Prior to December 1949 when the idols were shifted into the disputed structure from the
Ram-chabutra, worship by Hindu devotees at the Ram-chabutra for a long time without any
objection from Muslims is also beyond controversy. A controversy, however, is raised about use of
the disputed structure as a mosque from 1934 to December 1949. One version is that after some
disturbances in 1934, the use of the disputed structure as a mosque had been stopped from 1934
itself and not merely from December 1949. The other side disputes the alleged disuse of the mosque
for prayers prior to December 1949. The stand of the Uttar Pradesh Government in the suits was
that the place was used as a mosque till 1949.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37494799/ 3Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui Etc, Mohd. ... vs Union Of India And Others on 24 October, 1994

12. As a result of the incidents at Ayodhya on 6th December, 1992, the President of India issued a
proclamation under Article 356 of the Constitution of India assuming to himself all the functions of
the Government of Uttar Pradesh, dissolving the U.P. Vidhan Sabha. The White Paper in Chapter II
mentions the "BACKGROUND" and therein it is stated as under:

2.1 At the center of the. RJB-BM dispute is the demand voiced by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)
and its allied organisations for the restoration of a site said to be the birth place of Sri Ram in
Ayodhya. Till 6th December, 1992 this site was occupied by the structure erected in 1528 by 'Mir
Baqi' who claimed to have built it on; orders of the first Mughal Emperor Babar; This structure has
been described in the old Government records as Masjid Janmasthan. It is now commonly retired to
as Ram Janma Bhumi-Babri Masjid.

2.2 The VHP and its allied organisations base their demand on the assertion that this site is the birth
place of Sri Ram and a Hindu temple commemorating this site stood here till it was destroyed on
Babar's command and a Masjid was erected in its place. The demand of the VHP has found support
from the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). The construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site, after
removal or relocation of the existing structure, was a major plank in BJP's campaign during
elections held in 1989 and 1991. Other major political parties, however, had generally opposed this
demand and had taken the stand that while a temple should be built, the issues in dispute should be
resolved either by negotiations or by orders of the Court.

2.3 During the negotiations aimed at finding an amicable solution to the dispute, one issue which
came to the fore was whether a Hindu temple had existed on the site occupied by the disputed
structure and whether it was demolished on Babar's orders for the construction of the Masjid. It was
stated on behalf of the Muslim organisations, as well as by certain eminent historians, that there was
no evidence in favour of either of these two assertions. It was also stated by certain Muslim leaders
that if these assertions were proved, the Muslims would voluntarily handover the disputed shrine to
the Hindus. Naturally, this became the central issue in the negotiations between the VHP and
AIBMAC.

XXX XXX XXX 2.12 The historical debate has thus remained inconclusive although much progress
has been made in identifying the areas of agreement and difference. Conclusive findings can be
obtained only by way of reference to a competent authority. However, as brought out elsewhere in
this Paper the negotiations were disrupted at a crucial phase. Now, the entire evidence has
disappeared along with the disputed structure. It is tragic and ironical that the Ram-chabutra and
Kaushalya Rasoi, which continued as places of worship during periods of Muslim and British rule
have disappeared along with the RJB-BM structure at the hands of people professing to be 'devotees'
of Lord Ram.

PLACING OF IDOLS IN THE DISPUTED STRUCTURE 2.13 As has been mentioned above, Hindu
structures of worship already existed in the outer courtyard of the RJB-BM structure. On the night
of 22nd/23rd December, 1949, however, Hindu idols were placed under the central dome of the
main structure. Worship of these idols was started on a big scale from the next morning. As this was
likely to disturb the public peace, the civil administration attached the premises under Section 145

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37494799/ 4Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui Etc, Mohd. ... vs Union Of India And Others on 24 October, 1994

of the CrPC. This was the starting point of a whole chain of events which ultimately led to the
demolition of the structure. The main events of this chain have been summarised in Apppendix-I.

2.14 Soon after the installation of the idols two civil suits were filed by Hindu plaintiffs seeking to
restrain the Administration from removing the idols from the disputed structure or placing any
restrictions in the way of devotees intending to offer worship. Interim injunctions were issued by the
civil court to this effect. These injunctions were confirmed by the Allahabad High Court in 1955.

2.15 The Hindu Idols thus continued inside the disputed structure since 1949. Worship of these idols
by Hindus also continued without interruption since 1949 and the structure was not used by the
Muslim's for offering prayers since then. The controversy remained at a low ebb till 1986 when the
District Court of Faizabad ordered opening of the lock placed on a grill leading to the
sanctum-sanctorum of the shrine. An organisation called the Babri Masjid Action Committee
(BMAC), seeking restoration of the disputed shrine to the Muslims came into being and launched a
protest movement. The Hindu organisations, on the other hand, stepped up their activities to
mobilise public opinion for the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site.

13. After the imposition of President's rule in the State of Uttar Pradesh as a consequence of the
events at Ayodhya on 6th December, 1992, action taken by the Central Government is detailed in
Chapter VIII of the White Paper with reference to the communal situation in the country which
deteriorated sharply following the demolition of the RJB-BM structure on 6th December, 1992 and
spread of communal violence in several other States. Para 9.11 in Chapter VIII relating to the
"ACTION TAKEN BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT" is as under :
8.11 Mention has been made above (Overview) of the decisions taken on 7th December by the
Government to ban communal organisations, to take strong action for prosecution of the offences
connected with the demolition, to fix responsibilities of various authorities for their lapses relating
to the events of December 6, to rebuild the demolished structure and to take appropriate steps
regarding new Ram Temple. The last two decisions were further elaborated on 27th December as
follows:

The Government has decided to acquire all areas in dispute in the suits pending in the Allahabad
High Court. It has also been decided to acquire suitable adjacent area. The acquired area excluding
the area on which the disputed structure stood would be made available to two Trusts which would
be set up for construction of a Ram Temple and a Mosque respectively and for planned development
of the area.

The Government of India has also decided to request the President to seek the opinion of the
Supreme Court on the question whether there was a Hindu temple existing on the site where the
disputed structure stood. The Government has also decided to abide by the opinion of the Supreme
Court and to take appropriate steps to enforce the Court's opinion. Notwithstanding the acquisition
of the disputed area, the Government would ensure that the position existing prior to the
promulgation of the Ordinance is maintained until such time as the Supreme Court gives its opinion
in the matter. Thereafter the rights of the parties shall be determined in the light of the Court's

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37494799/ 5Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui Etc, Mohd. ... vs Union Of India And Others on 24 October, 1994

opinion.

In pursuance of these decisions an Ordinance named ‘Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya
Ordinance’ was issued on 7th January, 1993 for acquisition of 67.703 acres of land in the Ram
Janma Bhoomi-Babri Masjid complex. A reference to the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the
Constitution was also made on the same day. Copy of the Ordinance is at Appendix-XV and of the
Reference at Appendix-XVI.

14. The Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Ordinance, 1993 (No. 8 of 1993) has been "replaced
by the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993 (No. 33 of 1993), the constitutional validity
of which has to be examined by us.

15. The said Ordinance, later replaced by Act No. 33 of 1993, and the Special Reference under Article
143(1) of the Constitution of India were made simultaneously the same day on 7th January, 1993. It
would be appropriate at this stage to quote, in extenso, the Statement of Objects and Reasons for
this enactment, the said Act No. 33 of 1993, and the Special Reference under Article 143(1) of the
Constitution:

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS There has been a long-standing dispute relating to the
erstwhile Ram-Janma Bhumi-Babri Masjid structure in Ayodhya which led to communal tension
and violence from time to time and ultimately led to the destruction of the disputed structure on 6th
December, 1992. This was followed by wide-spread communal violence which resulted in large
number of deaths, injuries and destruction of property in various parts of the country. The said
dispute has thus affected the maintenance of public order and harmony between different
communities in the country. As it is necessary to maintain communal harmony and the spirit of
common brotherhood amongst the people of India, it was considered necessary to acquire the site of
the disputed structure and suitable adjacent land for setting up a complex which could be developed
in a planned manner wherein a Ram temple, a mosque, amenities for pilgrims, a library, museum
and other suitable facilities can be set up.

2. The Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Ordinance, 1993 was accordingly promulgated by the
President on 7th January, 1993. By virtue of the said Ordinance the right, title and interest in
respect of certain areas at Ayodhya specified in the Schedule to the Ordinance stand transferred to,
and vest in, the Central Government.

3. The Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance.

THE SCHEDULE (See Section 2(a)) DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA XXX XXX XXX

16. At the hearing, it was strenuously urged that the question of fact referred under Article 143(1) of
the Constitution is vague; the answer to it is by itself not decisive of the real controversy since the
core question has not been referred; and it also gives no definite indication of the manner in which
the Central Government intends to act after the Special Reference is answered, to settle the dispute.
It was urged that the question referred is, therefore, academic, apart from being vague, and it does
not serve any constitutional purpose to subserve which the advisory jurisdiction of this Court could
be invoked; that the real object and purpose of reference is to take away a place of worship of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37494799/ 14Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui Etc, Mohd. ... vs Union Of India And Others on 24 October, 1994

Muslims and give it away to the Hindus offending the basic feature of secularism; and that,
therefore, we should decline to answer the Special Reference. The learned Solicitor General who
appeared for the Union of India was asked to clarify the stand of the Central Government on this
point. Initially, it was stated by the learned Solicitor General that the answer to the question would
provide the basis for further negotiations between the different groups to settle the controversy and
the Central Government would then be able to decide the effective course available to it for resolving
the controversy. On being asked to further clarify the stand of the Central Government about the
purpose of the Special Reference, the learned Solicitor General made a statement in writing on
behalf of the Union of India on 14th September, 1994 as under:
Government stands by the policy of secularism and of even-handed treatment of all religious
communities. The Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993, as well as the Presidential
Reference, have the objective of maintaining public order and promoting communal harmony and
the spirit of common brotherhood amongst the people of India.

Government is committed to the construction of a Ram temple and a mosque, but their actual
location will be determined only after the Supreme Court renders its opinion in the Presidential
Reference.

Government will treat the finding of the Supreme Court on the question of fact referred under
Article 143 of the Constitution as a verdict which is final and binding.

In the light of the Supreme Court's opinion and consistent with it, Government will make efforts to
resolve the controversy by a process of negotiations. Government is confident that the opinion of the
Supreme Court will have a salutary effect on the attitude of the communities and they will no longer
take conflicting positions on the factual issue settled by the Supreme Court.

If efforts at, a negotiated settlement as aforesaid do not succeed, Government is committed to
enforce a solution in the light of the Supreme Court's opinion and consistent with it. Government's
action in this regard will be even-handed in respect of both the communities. If the question
referred is answered in the affirmative, namely, that a Hindu temple/structure did exist prior to the
construction of the demolished structure, Government action will be in support of the wishes of the
Hindu community. If, on the other hand, the question is answered in the negative, namely, that no
such Hindu temple/ structure existed at the relevant time, then Government action will be in
support of the wishes of the Muslim community.

This statement in writing made by the learned Solicitor General on behalf of the Union of India
forms a part of the record and has to be taken into account to indicate the purpose for which the
Special Reference under Article 143(1) has been made to this Court.

17. The dispute and its background are mentioned in paras 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of Chapter II of the
White Paper quoted earlier. This is the backdrop in which the constitutional validity of Act No. 33 of
1993 and the maintainability of the Special Reference made under Article 143(1) of the Constitution
of India have to be examined.

VALIDITY OF ACT NO. 33 OF 1993

18. Broadly stated, the focus of challenge to the statute as a whole is on the grounds of secularism,
right to equality and right to freedom of religion. Challenge to the acquisition of the area in excess of
the disputed area is in addition on the ground that the acquisition was unnecessary being unrelated
to the dispute pertaining to the small disputed area within it. A larger argument advanced on behalf
of some of the parties who have assailed the act with considerable vehemence is that a mosque being
a place of religious worship by the Muslims, independently of whether the acquisition did affect the
right to practise religion, is wholly immune from the State's power of acquisition and the statute is,
therefore, unconstitutional as violative of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India for this
reason alone. The others, however, limited this argument of immunity from acquisition only to
places of special significance, forming an essential and integral part of the right to practise the
religion, the acquisition of which would result in the estimation of the right to freedom of religion
itself. It was also contended that the purpose of acquisition in the present case does not bring the
statute within the ambit of Entry 42, List III but is referable to Entry 1, List II and, therefore, the
Parliament did not have the competence to enact the same. It was then urged by learned Counsel
canvassing the Muslim interest that the legislation is tilted heavily in favour of the Hindu interests
and, therefore, suffers from the vice of non-secularism and discrimination in addition to violation of
the right to freedom of religion of the Muslim community. It was also urged by them that the Central
Government, after the Prime Minister's statement made on 7th December, 1992, to rebuild the
demolished structure (para 1.22 in Chapter I of the White Paper) resiled from the same and by
incorporating certain provisions in the statute has sought to perpetuate the injustice done to the
Muslim community by the act of vandalism of demolition of the structure at Ayodhya on 6th
December, 1992. On behalf of the Muslim community, it is urged that the statute read in the context
of the content of the question referred under Article 143(1) of the Constitution, as it must be, is a
mere veiled concealment of a device adopted by the Central Government to perpetuate the
consequences of the demolition of the mosque on 6th December, 1992. The grievance of the Hindu
opponents is that the mischief and acts of vandalism committed by a few are being attributed to the
entire Hindu community the majority of whom is equally hurt by, and critical of, the shameful act.
They urge that this disapproval by the majority community is evident from the result of the
subsequent elections in which the Bhartiya Janata Party was rejected at the hustings by the Hindu
majority. They also submit that the fact of demolition of Hindu structures like the Ramchabutra and
Kaushalya Rasoi which stood since ages in the disputed site resulting in interruption of even the
undisputed right of worship of Hindus within that area is being ignored. It is also contended that
there is no justification for acquisition of any property in excess of the disputed area and, therefore,
the acquisition at least of the excess area belonging, admittedly, to Hindus is invalid.

On behalf of the Central Government, it is urged that in the existing situation and in view of the
widespread communal flare-up throughout the country on account of the events at Ayodhya on 6th
December, 1992, the most appropriate course, in the opinion of the Central Government, was to
make this acquisition along with the Special Reference to decide the question which would facilitate
a negotiated solution of the problem, and if it failed, to enable the Central Government to take any
other appropriate action to resolve the controversy and restore communal harmony in the country.
It was made clear that acquisition of the disputed area was not meant to deprive the community

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37494799/ 13Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui Etc, Mohd. ... vs Union Of India And Others on 24 October, 1994

found entitled to it, of the same, or to retain any part of the excess area which was not necessary for
a proper resolution of the dispute or to effectuate the purpose of the acquisition, it was submitted
that an assurance of communal harmony throughout the country was a prime constitutional
purpose and avoidance of escalation of the dispute in the wake of the incident at Ayodhya on 6th
December, 1992 was an essential step in that direction, which undoubtedly promotes the creed of
secularism instead of impairing it. It was submitted that the charge leveled against the Central
Government of discrimination against any religious community or of anti-secularism is wholly
unwarranted.

19. Another argument advanced on behalf of the Muslim community was that the defences open to
the minority community in the suits filed by the other side including that of adverse possession by
virtue of long possession of the disputed site for over 400 years since its construction in 1528 A. D.
have also been extinguished by the acquisition, giving an unfair advantage to the other side. It was
also urged that the core question in the dispute between the parties was not the Subject-matter of
the Special Reference made under Article 143(1) of the Constitution and, therefore, answer to the
same would not result in a resolution of the dispute between the parties to the suits. It was
accordingly urged, there is deprivation of the judicial remedy for adjudication of the dispute without
the substitution of an alternate dispute resolution mechanism, which is impermissible under the
Constitution.

20. It is appropriate at this stage to refer to the provisions of the statute before we deal with the
arguments challenging its constitutional validity. The Statement of Objects and Reasons says that
there is a long-standing dispute relating to the disputed structure in Ayodhya which led to
communal tension and violence from time to time and ultimately has led to the destruction of the
disputed structure on 6th December, 1992 followed by widespread communal violence resulting in
loss of many lives and destruction of property throughout the country. The said dispute has thus
affected the maintenance of public order and communal harmony in the country. Obviously, it is
necessary to maintain and promote communal harmony and fraternity amongst the people of India.
With this objective in view it was considered necessary to acquire the site of the disputed structure
and the requisite adjacent area to be utilised in an appropriate manner to achieve this object.

For this purpose, the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Ordinance, 1993 was promulgated by
the President on 7th January, 1993 and, simultaneously, on the same day, this Reference was also
made by the President to this Court under Article 143(1) of the Constitution. The said Ordinance was
replaced by the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993 (No. 33 of 1993) to the same effect,
and Section 1(2) provides that the Act shall be deemed to have come into force on the 7th January,
1993. The provisions of the said Act are now considered.

21. Section 3 provides for acquisition of rights in relation to the "area" defined in Section 2(a). It
says that on and from the commencement of this Act the right, title and interest in relation to the
area shall, by virtue of this Act, stand transferred to, and vest in, the Central Government. It is
well-settled that the meaning of "vest" takes colour from the context in which it is used and it is not
necessarily the, same in every provision or in every context. In Maharaj Singh v. State of Uttar
Pradesh , it was held :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37494799/ 14Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui Etc, Mohd. ... vs Union Of India And Others on 24 October, 1994

...[s such a construction of 'vesting' in two different senses in the same section, sound? Yes. It is,
because ‘vesting’ is a word of slippery import and has many meanings. The context controls the text
and the purpose and scheme project the particular semantic shade or nuance of meaning. That is
why even definition clauses allow themselves to be modified by contextual compulsions....

The meaning of "vest" in Section 3 and in Section 6 is of significance in the context of the
constitutional validity of the statute. It can vary in different parts of the statute or even the same
Section, depending on the context of its use.

22. Section 4 then provides the general effect of vesting. Obviously, the effect of vesting will depend
on the meaning of the word "vest" used in Section 3 and the kind of vesting in the present context.
Sub-section (1) of Section 4 provides that the area shall be deemed to include all assets, rights, etc.
specified therein of whatever nature relating thereto. Sub-section (2) further says that all properties
aforesaid which have vested in the Central Government under Section 3 shall, by force of such
vesting, be freed and discharged from all encumbrances affecting them and any attachment,
injunction, decree or order of any Court or tribunal or other authority restricting the use of such
properties in any manner or appointing any receiver in respect of the whole or any part of the
property shall cease to have effect. In other words, the effect of such vesting is to free all properties
aforesaid which have vested in the Central Government under Section 3 of all encumbrances and the
consequence of any order of any Court or tribunal of any kind restricting their user in any manner.
Sub-section (3) of Section 4 provides for abatement of all pending suits and legal proceedings. The
meaning of the word "vest" in Section 3 has a bearing on the validity of this provision since the
consequence of abatement of suits etc. provided therein is relatable only to absolute vesting of the
disputed area which is the subject-matter of the suits and not to a situation where the vesting under
Section 3 is of a limited nature for a particular purpose, and is of limited duration till the happening
of a future event. Section 5 indicates the duty of the person or State Government in charge of the
management of the area to deliver all assets etc. to the Central Government on such vesting.
Sub-section (1) empowers the Central Government to take all necessary steps to secure possession of
the area which is vested in the Central Government under Section 3. Sub-section (2) obliges the
person or State Government of Uttar Pradesh, as the case may be, in charge of the management of
the area immediately before such vesting to deliver to the Central Government or the authorised
person all assets etc. in their custody relating to such vesting. In short, Section 5 provides the
consequential action to be taken by the Central Government with the corresponding obligation of
the person or State Government in charge of the management of the area to deliver possession of the
area, together with its management, to the Central Government, on such vesting.

23. Then comes Section 6 which is the last Section in Chapter II, to which detailed reference would
be made later. At this stage a general reference to its contents is sufficient. Section 6 contains the
power of Central Government to direct vesting of the area in another authority or body or. trust.
Sub-section (1) provides that the Central Government may, notwithstanding anything contained in
Sections 3, 4, 5 and 7, direct by notification in the Official Gazette, that the right, title and interest or
any of them in relation to the area or any part thereof, instead of continuing to vest in the Central
Government, vest in that authority or body or trustees of that trust from the specified date, if it is
satisfied that the same is willing to comply with such terms and conditions as the Central

JUDGMENT
SUDHANSU JYOTI MUKHOPADHAYA, J.
Leave granted.

2. This appeal has been preferred by the appellant-Durgapur Casual Workers Union and others
(hereinafter referred to as, 'the workmen’ for short) against the judgment and order dated 25th
February, 2009 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court at Calcutta in F.M.A. No.2345 of
2005 (C.A.N. 8685 of 2007 and C.A.N.4726 of 2008). By the impugned judgment, the High Court
allowed the appeal preferred by the respondent-Food Corporation of India (hereinafter referred to
as, 'the Corporation’ for short) and set aside the Award dated 9th June, 1999 passed by the Central
Government Industrial Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as, 'the Tribunal’ for short) as affirmed by
the learned Single Judge of the High Court at Calcutta.

3. The factual matrix of the case is as follows:

The Corporation had long back setup a rice mill in the name and style of Modern Rice Mill at
Durgapur and it had been handed to successive contractors for running the same. The concerned
workmen, forty nine in numbers, had been working as contract labours under the contractors in the
rice mill. The last contractor was M/s Civicon. The contract system was terminated and the rice mill
was closed in the year 1990-1991. Thereafter, the concerned workmen were directly employed by the
Corporation in June, 1991 as casual employees on daily wage basis in the Food Storage Depot at
Durgapur for performing the jobs of sweeping godown and wagon floors, putting covers on infested
stocks for fumigation purpose, cutting grass, collections and bagging of spillage from
godowns/wagons etc. There being an industrial dispute between the workmen and the Corporation

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98488805/ 1Durgapur Casual Workers Union & ... vs Food Corp.Of India & Ors on 9 December, 2014

regarding the regularisation of services of the workmen, the Government of India, Ministry of
Labour in exercise of powers conferred on them by clause (d) of sub Section (1) and Sub Section
(2A) of Section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as, 'the Act' for short)
referred the following dispute to the Tribunal for adjudication vide Ministry's order
No.L-22012/348/95-IR (C.ID dated 18th July, 1996.

SCHEDULE "Whether the demand of Durgapur Casual Workers Union for absorption of 49 casual
workmen as per list enclosed by the management of FCI, Durgapur is justified? If not, what relief
they are entitled to?"

4. The said reference was registered as Reference No.21 of 1996 before the Tribunal. The Tribunal on
appreciation of evidence brought on record by the Management of the Corporation and the
workmen and hearing the parties answered the reference in favour of the workmen by Award dated
gth June, 1999 and held that continued casualization of service of workmen amounts to unfair
labour practice as defined in item no.10 in part I of the Fifth Schedule of the Act and that social
justice principle demands order of absorption and thereby directed the Management to absorb 49
casual workmen as per list.

5. The Corporation being aggrieved preferred a Writ Petition being W.P.No.21368 (W) of 1999
before the High Court at Calcutta. The learned Single Judge of the High Court on hearing the parties
and taking into consideration the evidence on record, dismissed the writ petition by judgment and
order dated 18th February, 2005 and affirmed the Award passed by the Tribunal.

6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the learned Single Judge, the Corporation preferred an
appeal before the Division Bench of High Court at Calcutta. One of the grounds taken was that the
appointments of the workmen were backdoor appointments. The workmen were working under the
contractor whose services as terminated in the year 1990-1991 and thereafter on their demand, the
workmen were engaged as casual workmen under the Corporation in June, 1991. It was contended
that in view of Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka and
others v. Umadevi (3) and others, (2006) 4 SCC 1 and decisions rendered by this Court in other
cases, regularization of service cannot be allowed if it violates the basic principles of Articles 14 and
16 of the Constitution of India. The Division Bench of the High Court by impugned judgment dated
25th February, 2009 while setting aside the award as affirmed by the learned Single Judge held as
follows: "Hence, it appears that Appointing Authority has every right to appoint either in
substantive capacity or in casual manner and/or ad-hoc. It is also a settled legal position of law that
regularization/absorption of casual appointee/ad-hoc appointee in a permanent post is not other
mode of appointment..."

"In the instant case it appears that the workmen, illegal appointees, moved the writ application in
the year 1994 and got an order of status quo to maintain their service condition passed by the Writ
Court and as such, service of the workmen since 1994 till this date is covered by the order of the
Court, which is accordingly attracted by the said riders of para 53 as quoted, to negative their claim."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98488805/ 2Durgapur Casual Workers Union & ... vs Food Corp.Of India & Ors on 9 December, 2014

"Having regard to the aforesaid judgments of the Apex Court, now the law has got its firm root being
the law of the land that no regularization even in respect of a workman under Industrial Dispute Act
is permissible unless the contingencies of the law is satisfied, namely, appointment following the
rule, appointment in a post and appointment for a long continuous period in the angle of Secretary,
State of Karnataka and Ors. v. Uma Devi (3) and Ors. (supra). This law of the land was existing and
it has been re- echoed and reviewed in Secretary, State of Karnataka and Ors. v. Uma Devi (3) and
Ors. (supra)."

"In the instant case, from the decision under challenge in the writ application passed by the learned
Tribunal below, it appears that the Tribunal did not answer by any findings as to why workmen were
legally entitled to be absorbed permanently on considering the settled legal position of law that
absorption and/or regularization are not the mode of permanent appointment. Even the reasoning
as advanced, namely, "unfair labour practice", it also does not support the decision to regularize in
absence of any statutory provision for regularization of service of the workmen under the four
corners of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947. On the other hand, Industrial Dispute Act provides
under Chapter VC as already quoted above by Section 25-U, a penal consequences for imprisonment
and fine. The very essence and concept of unfair labour practice in the angle and anvil of Section
25-T and 25-Uis that in the industrial sector there is complete bar to appoint the casual appointees
for a continuous period with the object to deprive them the status and privileges of permanent
workmen and as a coercive measures to avoid such contingency, law has been framed in a negative
angle restraining/prohibiting such unfair labour practice under the pain of punishment with
imprisonment for a term in Section 25U. Hence, even if any unfair labour practice is assumed
though it requires to be proved by leading the evidence that such appointment as casual appointee
for a continuous period was with the mens rea to deprive the workmen from their permanent status
and privileges, the award prima facie speaks an "error of law" due to a decision applying principle of
"unfair labour practice" for "permanent absorption" and it also covers the field of "without
jurisdiction" principle..."

7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that in absence of any pleading
made by the Corporation before the Tribunal about legality of initial appointment of appellants, it
was not open to the Corporation to raise such question before the Division Bench of the High Court.
The Division Bench of the High Court was also not justified in giving any finding with regard to the
initial appointment of the workmen, in absence of any issue suggested or framed by the Tribunal.

8. On the other hand, the respondents have taken a similar plea as was taken before the High Court
that the initial appointments of the workmen were backdoor appointments and hence the
regularization is not permissible.

9. We have heard the rival contention of the parties and perused the record.

10. The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is a beneficial legislation enacted with an object for the

investigation and settlement of industrial disputes and for a certain other benefits. Section 2 (j) of
the Act defines industry as follows:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98488805/ 3Durgapur Casual Workers Union & ... vs Food Corp.Of India & Ors on 9 December, 2014

"2(j) "industry" means any business, trade, undertaking, manufacture or calling of employers and
includes any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of
workmen."

The Industrial dispute is defined under Section 2(k) as follows:- "2(k) "industrial dispute" means
any dispute or difference between employers and employers, or between employers and workmen,
or between workmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or non- employment
or the terms of employment or with the conditions of labour, of any person."

Section 2(ka) of the said Act defines "industrial establishment or undertaking" and reads as follow:

"(ka) "industrial establishment or undertaking" means an establishment or undertaking in which
any industry is carried on:

Provided that where several activities are carried on in an establishment or undertaking and only
one or some of such activities is or are an industry or industries, then,-
(a) if any unit of such establishment or undertaking carrying on any activity, being an industry, is
severable from the other unit or units of such establishment or undertaking, such unit shall be
deemed to be a separate industrial establishment or undertaking;

(b) if the predominant activity or each of the predominant activities carried on in such
establishment or undertaking or any unit thereof is an industry and the other activity or each of the
other activities carried on in such establishment or undertaking or unit thereof is not severable from
and is, for the purpose of carrying on, or aiding the carrying on of, such predominant activity or
activities, the entire establishment or undertaking or, as the case may be, unit thereof shall be
deemed to be an industrial establishment or undertaking;"

"Unfair labour practice", as defined under Section 2(ra) means any of the practices specified in the
Fifth Schedule.

11. The industrial establishment or undertaking as defined in the Act not only includes the State
Public Undertakings, the Subsidiary Companies set up by the Principal Undertaking and
Autonomous bodies owned or control by the State Government or Central Government but also the
private industries and undertakings.

Industrial Disputes Act is applicable to all the industries as defined under the Act, whether
Government undertaking or private industry. If any unfair labour practice is committed by any
industrial establishment, whether Government undertaking or private undertaking, pursuant to
reference made by the appropriate Government the Labour Court/Tribunal will decide the question
of unfair labour practice.

12. In the matter of appointment in the services of the ‘State’, including a public establishment or
undertaking, Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India are attracted. However, Articles 14 and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98488805/ 4Durgapur Casual Workers Union & ... vs Food Corp.Of India & Ors on 9 December, 2014

16 of the Constitution of India are not attracted in the matter of appointment in a private
establishment or undertaking.

13. An undertaking of the Government, which comes within the meaning of industry or its
establishment, cannot justify its illegal action including unfair labour practice nor can ask for
different treatment on the ground that public undertaking is guided by Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India and the private industries are not guided by Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India.

14. In the light of above discussion, in the present case the issues that are to be determined are as
follows:

1) Whether an issue relating to the validity of initial appointment can be raised in absence of any
specific pleading or reference.

2) The Tribunal having held, as affirmed by the High Court that the respondent corporation had
committed unfair trade practice against the workmen depriving them of status and privileges of
permanent workmen; whether the workmen were entitled for relief of absorption?

15. Before deciding the issues, it is necessary to notice the relevant decisions of this Court regarding
regularization of service/absorption in the Government Service or its undertakings in the light of
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

16. In Uma Devi (3) Constitution Bench of this Court while observing that casual/temporary
employees do not have any right to regular or permanent employment held as follows:

"43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a basic feature of
our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of our Constitution, a court would certainly be
disabled from passing an order upholding a violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of
the need to comply with the requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of the Constitution.
Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public employment, this Court while laying down the law,
has necessarily to hold that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a
proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any right on the appointee.
If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it
were an engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end
when it is discontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be made permanent on
the expiry of his term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely because a temporary
employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he
would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely on the strength
of such continuance, if the original appointment was not made by following a due process of
selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment
at the instance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to an end or of ad
hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, do not acquire any right. The High
Courts acting under Article 226 of the Constitution, should not ordinarily issue directions for

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98488805/ 5Durgapur Casual Workers Union & ... vs Food Corp.Of India & Ors on 9 December, 2014

absorption, regularisation, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made
regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely because an employee had continued
under cover of an order of the court, which we have described as "litigious employment" in the
earlier part of the judgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made
permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing
interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it is found entitled to
relief, it may be possible for it to mould the relief in such a manner that ultimately no prejudice will
be caused to him, whereas an interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the
regular [pic]procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an employee who is
really not required. The courts must be careful in ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the
economic arrangement of its affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the
instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory mandates."

45. While directing that appointments, temporary or casual, be regularised or made permanent, the
courts are swayed by the fact that the person concerned has worked for some time and in some cases
for a considerable length of time. It is not as if the person who accepts an engagement either
temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his employment. He accepts the
employment with open eyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to bargain-not at arm's
length-since he might have been searching for some employment so as to eke out his livelihood and
accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the
constitutional scheme of appointment and to take [pic]the view that a person who has temporarily
or casually got employed should be directed to be continued permanently. By doing so, it will be
creating another mode of public appointment which is not permissible. If the court were to void a
contractual employment of this nature on the ground that the parties were not having equal
bargaining power, that too would not enable the court to grant any relief to that employee. A total
embargo on such casual or temporary employment is not possible, given the exigencies of
administration and if imposed, would only mean that some people who at least get employment
temporarily, contractually or casually, would not be getting even that employment when securing of
such employment brings at least some succour to them. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast
country are in search of employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or temporary
employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in that context that one has
to proceed on the basis that the employment was accepted fully knowing the nature of it and the
consequences flowing from it. In other words, even while accepting the employment, the person
concerned knows the nature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the real sense
of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in which he is temporarily employed or the
interest in that post cannot be considered to be of such a magnitude as to enable the giving up of the
procedure established, for making regular appointments to available posts in the services of the
State. The argument that since one has been working for some time in the post, it will not be just to
discontinue him, even though he was aware of the nature of the employment when he first took it
up, is not one that would enable the jettisoning of the procedure established by law for public
employment and would have to fail when tested on the touchstone of constitutionality and equality
of opportunity enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution."

However, in respect of irregular appointments of duly qualified persons working for more than 10
years, this Court observed:

"53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where irregular appointments (not illegal
appointments) as explained in S.V. Narayanappaii, R.N. Nanjundappai2 and B.N. Nagarajan8 and
referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have
been made and the employees have continued to work for ten years or more but without the
intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The question of regularisation of the services of
such employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this
Court in the cases above-referred to and in the light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of
India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a
one-time measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten years or
more in duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should
further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that
require to be filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now
employed. The process must be set in motion within six months from this date. We also clarify that
regularisation, if any already made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on this
judgment, but there should be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and
regularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme.

17. This Court in the case of M.P. Administration v. Tribhuban, (2007) 9 SCC 748 while taking into
account the doctrine of public employment involving public money and several other facts observed
as follows: "6. The question, however, which arises for consideration is as to whether in a situation
of this nature, the learned Single Judge and consequently the Division Bench of the Delhi High
Court should have directed reinstatement [pic]of the respondent with full back wages. Whereas at
one point of time, such a relief used to be automatically granted, but keeping in view several other
factors and in particular the doctrine of public employment and involvement of the public money, a
change in the said trend is now found in the recent decisions of this Court. This Court in a large
number of decisions in the matter of grant of relief of the kind distinguished between a daily wager
who does not hold a post and a permanent employee. It may be that the definition of "workman" as
contained in Section 2(s) of the Act is wide and takes within its embrace all categories of workmen
specified therein, but the same would not mean that even for the purpose of grant of relief in an
industrial dispute referred for adjudication, application of constitutional scheme of equality
adumbrated under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, in the light of a decision of a
Constitution Bench of this Court in Secy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3) and other relevant
factors pointed out by the Court in )a catena of decisions shall not be taken into consideration.

7. The nature of appointment, whether there existed any sanctioned post or whether the officer
concerned had any authority to make appointment are relevant factors. (See M.P. Housing Board v.
Manoj Shrivastava (2006)2 SCC 702, State of M.P. v. Arjunlal Rajak (2006)2 SCC 711 and M.P. State
Agro Industries Development Corpn. Ltd. v. S.C. Pandey, 2006 (2) SCC 716.)

18. The effect of Constitution Bench decision in Uma Devi (3), in case of unfair labour practice was
considered by this Court in Maharashtra State Road Transport and another v. Casteribe Rajya

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98488805/ 7Durgapur Casual Workers Union & ... vs Food Corp.Of India & Ors on 9 December, 2014

Parivahan Karmchari Sanghatana (2009) 8 SCC 556. In the said case, this Court held that
Umadevi's case has not over ridden powers of Industrial and Labour Courts in passing appropriate
order, once unfair labour practice on the part of employer is established. This Court observed and
held as follows:

"34. It is true that Dharwad Distt. PWD Literate Daily Wages Employees’ Assn.v. State of Karnataka,
(1990) 2 SCC 396 arising out of industrial adjudication has been considered in State of Karnataka v
.Umadevi (3), (2006)4 SCC 1 and that decision has been held to be not laying down the correct law
but [pic]a careful and complete reading of the decision in Umadevi (3) leaves no manner of doubt
that what this Court was concerned in Umadevi (3) was the exercise of power by the High Courts
under Article 226 and this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India in the matters of
public employment where the employees have been engaged as contractual, temporary or casual
workers not based on proper selection as recognised by the rules or procedure and yet orders of
their regularisation and conferring them status of permanency have been passed.

35. Umadevi (3) is an authoritative pronouncement for the proposition that the Supreme Court
(Article 32) and the High Courts (Article 226) should not issue directions of absorption,
regularisation or permanent continuance of temporary, contractual, casual, daily wage or ad hoc
employees unless the recruitment itself was made regularly in terms of the constitutional scheme.

36. Umadevi (3) does not denude the Industrial and Labour Courts of their statutory power under
Section 30 read with Section 32 of the MRTU and PULP Act to order permanency of the workers
who have been victims of unfair labour practice on the part of the employer under Item 6 of
Schedule IV where the posts on which they have been working exist. Umadevi (3) cannot be held to
have overridden the powers of the Industrial and Labour Courts in passing appropriate order under
Section 30 of the MRTU and PULP Act, once unfair labour practice on the part of the employer
under Item 6 of Schedule IV is established."

"47. It was strenuously urged by the learned Senior Counsel for the Corporation that the Industrial
Court having found that the Corporation indulged in unfair labour practice in employing the
complainants as casuals on piece-rate basis, the only direction that could have been given to the
Corporation was to cease and desist from indulging in such unfair labour practice and no direction
of according permanency to these employees could have been given. We are afraid, the argument
ignores and overlooks the specific power given to the Industrial/Labour Court under Section
30(1)(b) to take affirmative action against the erring employer which as noticed above is of wide
amplitude and comprehends within its fold a direction to the employer to accord permanency to the
employees affected by such unfair labour practice."

19. Almost similar issue relating to unfair trade practice by employer and the effect of decision of
Umadevi (3) in the grant of relief was considered by this Court in Ajaypal Singh v. Haryana
Warehousing Corporation in Civil Appeal No.6327 of 2014 decided on 9th July, 2014. In the said
case, this Court observed and held as follows: "20.The provisions of Industrial Disputes Act and the
powers of the Industrial and Labour Courts provided therein were not at all under consideration in
Umadevi's case. The issue pertaining to unfair labour practice was neither the subject matter for

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98488805/ 8Durgapur Casual Workers Union & ... vs Food Corp.Of India & Ors on 9 December, 2014

decision nor was it decided in Umadevi's case.

21. We have noticed that Industrial Disputes Act is made for settlement of industrial disputes and
for certain other purposes as mentioned therein. It prohibits unfair labour practice on the part of the
employer in engaging employees as casual or temporary employees for a long period without giving
them the status and privileges of permanent employees.

22. Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 stipulates conditions precedent to retrenchment
of workmen. A workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less
than one year under an employer is entitled to benefit under said provision if the employer
retrenches workman. Such a workman cannot be retrenched until he/she is given one month's
notice in writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period of notice has expired, or the
workman has been paid in lieu of such notice, wages for the period of the notice apart from
compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days' average pay for every completed year of
continuous service or any part thereof in excess of six months. It also mandates the employer to
serve a notice in the prescribed manner on the appropriate Government or such authority as may be
specified by the appropriate Government by notification in the Official Gazette.

If any part of the provisions of Section 25F is violated and the employer thereby, resorts to unfair
trade practice with the object to deprive the workman with the privilege as provided under the Act,
the employer cannot justify such an action by taking a plea that the initial appointment of the
employee was in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

23. Section 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act relates to re-employment of retrenched workmen.
Retrenched workmen shall be given preference over other persons if the employee proposes to
employ any person.

24. We have held that provisions of Section 25H are in conformity with the Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India, though the aforesaid provisions (Articles 14 and 16) are not attracted in the
matter of re- employment of retrenched workmen in a private industrial establishment and
undertakings. Without giving any specific reason to that effect at the time of retrenchment, it is not
open to the employer of a public industrial establishment and undertaking to take a plea that initial
appointment of such workman was made in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
India or the workman was a backdoor appointee.

25. It is always open to the employer to issue an order of "retrenchment" on the ground that the
initial appointment of the workman was not in conformity with Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India or in accordance with rules. Even for retrenchment on such ground, unfair
labour practice cannot be resorted and thereby workman cannot be retrenched on such ground
without notice, pay and other benefits in terms of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, if
continued for more than 240 days in a calendar year.

26. However, in other cases, when no such plea is taken by the employer in the order of
retrenchment that the workman was appointed in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98488805/ 9Durgapur Casual Workers Union & ... vs Food Corp.Of India & Ors on 9 December, 2014

of India or in violation of any statutory rule or his appointment was a backdoor appointment, while
granting relief, the employer cannot take a plea that initial appointment was in violation of Articles
14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, in absence of a reference made by the appropriate
Government for determination of question whether the initial appointment of the workman was in
violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India or statutory rules. Only if such reference is
made, a workman is required to lead evidence to prove that he was appointed by following
procedure prescribed under the Rules and his initial appointment was legal."

20. In the present case, it is admitted that the workmen had been working as contract labours under
the contractor in the rice mill of the Corporation. The contract system was terminated and the rice
mill was closed in the year 1990-1991. The effect was termination of services of the workmen. In that
view of the matter, they were entitled for re-employment when the employer proposed to take into
his employment any person, in view of Section 25H, which reads as follows:

"Section 25H. Re-employment of retrenched workmen.- Where any workmen are retrenched, and
the employer proposes to take into his employ any persons, he shall, in such manner as may be
prescribed, give an opportunity to the retrenched workmen who are citizens of India to offer
themselves for re- employment and such retrenched workman who offer themselves for reemployment shall have preference over other persons."

Under Section 25H the retrenched workman who offer themselves for employment shall have
preference over other persons. It was for the said reason the workmen were employed by the
Corporation in June, 1991.

21. This Court in Ajaypal Singh held that the provisions of Section 25H are in conformity with
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, though, the aforesaid provisions (Articles 14 and 16)
are not attracted in the matter of re-employment of retrenched workmen in private industrial
establishment and undertakings. In that view of the matter it can be safely held that the workmen
who were retrenched, were rightly taken in the services of Corporation. Admittedly, no plea was
taken by the Corporation either before the State Government or before the Tribunal that the initial
appointment of workmen were illegal or they were appointed through back door means.

22. In this background, we are of the view that it was not open to the Division Bench of the High
Court, particularly in absence of any such plea taken by the Corporation before the Tribunal to come
to a finding of fact that initial appointments of workmen were in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India, nor it was open to the High Court to deny the benefit to which the workmen
were entitled under item 10 of Part I of the Fifth Schedule of the Act, the Tribunal having given
specific finding of unfair trade practice on the part of the Management of the Corporation.

23. Having accepted that there was unfair trade practice, it was not open to the Division Bench of
the High Court to interfere with the impugned award.

24. For the reasons aforesaid, we aside the impugned judgment dated 25th February, 2009 passed
by the Division Bench of the High Court at Calcutta in F.M.A. No.2345 of 2005 (C.A.N.8685 of 2007

1996 as affirmed by the learned Single Judge by order dated 18th February, 2005 in W.P. No.21368
(W) of 1999 is upheld. The respondent- Corporation is directed to implement the Award from its
due date as ordered by the Tribunal. The appeal is allowed with aforesaid observations and
directions. No costs.

These appeals by special leave are directed against the common judgment and order of the Gauhati
High Court dated 21st July, 2003 in Writ Petition (C) No. 6541 of 2001 [WP (C) No.221(SH)/2002]
and Writ Petition (C) No. 6542 of 2001 [WP (C) No.222(SH)/2002] whereby the High Court
dismissed the writ petitions filed by the appellants herein.

Appellant Ewanlangki-e Rymbai, a Christian by faith is a Member of the Jaintia Scheduled Tribe.
The other appellant, namely HElaka Jowai Secular Movement is represented by its Vice Chairman
and Executive Member. In both the writ petitions the constitutional validity of Section 3 of the
United Khasi Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and
Headmen) Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1959') has been challenged. The writ
petitions also challenged the notice dated August 28, 2001 issued by the Jaintia Hills Autonomous
District Council, Jowai declaring the programme for the election of Dolloi in the Elaka Jowai and
also the notice dated September 4, 2001 issued by the Secretary, Executive Committee, Jaintia Hills
Autonomous District Council, Jowai.

 

 

 

 

Section 3 of the Act of 1959 provides that subject to the provisions of the Act and the Rules made
thereunder all elections and appointments of Chiefs and Headmen shall be in accordance with the
existing customs prevailing in the Elaka concerned. The notice dated September 4, 2001 announced
the programme for the conduct of election for Dolloi in the Elaka Jowai but the notice issued by the
Secretary on behalf of the Executive Committee, Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council, Jowai
provided that only the members of the clans mentioned therein could contest the aforesaid election
and thereby the persons belonging to the Christian faith were excluded from contesting the said
election. The appellants contend that exclusion of Christians from contesting the election is in
violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India since they are excluded only on the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 1Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

ground of religion. They further contend that Section 3 of the Act of 1959 which provided that the
appointment of the Chiefs or Headmen shall be in accordance with the existing customs prevailing
in the Elaka concerned, is also bad. It gives legal sanctity to a customs which itself is in breach of
Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India. In sum and sub stance the appellants contend that
exclusion of Christians from contesting election for the post of Dolloi in Elaka Jowai is
discriminatory and in breach of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India since their exclusion is
merely on the ground of religion.

We may notice at the threshold that Jowai District is an autonomous District to which the
provisions of Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India apply in view of the provisions of Article
244(2) of the Constitution of India. The brief historical background in which the aforesaid
autonomous district was created may be noticed at this stage :
On coming into force of the Constitution of India the United Khasi- Jaintia Hills District was formed
as one of the Tribal Areas of Assam by merging the Khasi States with the other areas of the
Khasi-Jaintia Hills, boundaries whereof were defined by para 20(2) of the Sixth Schedule to the
Constitution (hereinafter referred to as 'the Schedule’). Under para 2(4) of the Schedule, the
administration of the aforesaid district vested in the District Council which was clothed with
administrative and judicial powers. In view of the demand for creation of an autonomous District
comprising the Jowai sub-division of the aforesaid District, the Governor of Assam appointed a
Commission to look into the matter and make its recommendation. The report of the Commission
was placed before the Legislative Assembly which approved the action proposed to be taken
pursuant to the report. Consequently on November 23, 1964 a Notification was issued by the
Governor of Assam creating a new autonomous District Council for the Jowai Sub-Division by
excluding Jowai Sub-division from the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District with effect
from December 1, 1964. Thus the Jowai District came into existence as an autonomous District with
effect from December 1, 1964.

As earlier noticed Article 244(2) of the Constitution provides that the provision of the Sixth
Schedule shall be applied to the administration of the tribal areas in the State of Assam. The tribal
areas in Assam are governed not by the relevant provisions of the Constitution which apply to the
other Constituent States of the Union of India but by the provisions contained in the Sixth Schedule.
These provisions purport to provide for a self-contained code for the governance of the tribal areas
forming part of Assam and they deal with all the relevant topics in that behalf. (See : Edwingson
Bareh vs. The State of Assam and others : AIR 1966 SC 1220).

Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule provides for the formation of an autonomous district and further
provides that if there are different scheduled tribes in an autonomous district, the Governor may by
public notification divide the area or areas inhabited by them into autonomous regions. Paragraph 2
provides for the constitution of a District Council for each autonomous district. Similarly for each
autonomous region a separate Regional Council is provided. The administration of an autonomous
district insofar as it is not vested under the Schedule in any Regional Council within such district, is
vested in the District Council for such district. The administration of an autonomous region is
vested in the Regional Council for such region. Sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 2 empowers the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 2Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

Governor to make Rules for the first constitution of District Councils and Regional Councils in
consultation with the existing tribal Councils or other representative tribal organizations within the
autonomous districts or regions concerned. Paragraphs 3 to 17 make provision for the
administration of the autonomous Districts and the Regions. Paragraph 3 in particular provides that
the District Council for an autonomous district in respect of all areas within the district except those
which are under the authority of Regional Councils, if any, shall have power to make laws with
respect to the matters enumerated therein which provide inter alia D"for the appointment or
succession of Chiefs or Headmen". The laws made under this paragraph are required to be
submitted forthwith to the Governor and, until assented to by him, shall have no effect.

 

 

 

 

In exercise of powers conferred upon him by sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 2, the Governor
framed rules called "the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules,
1951". The Rules provide, inter alia, for the constitution of an Executive Committee consisting of the
Chief Executive Members as the head and two other members to exercise the executive functions of
the District Council.

After the coming into the existence of Jowai District as an autonomous District the Jowai
Autonomous District Act, 1967 was enacted. The provisions of this Act were made applicable to the
Jowai Autonomous District and the Rules of 1951, as amended from time to time, were made
applicable. The Act, Rules and Regulations framed under the United Khasi- Jaintia Hills District
Council as listed in Appendix LI were also made applicable to the Jowai Autonomous District till
such time the Jowai Autonomous District Council made its own laws. Appendix LI includes the
United Khasi Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and
Headmen) Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1959 Act') which was made applicable to the
Jowai District Council.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2 (a), (b) and (g) of the 1959 Act are as follows :
 

 

 

"2. Definition. Ln this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the following expressions shall
have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say :
 

(a) "Chief" means a Sylem, a Lyngdoh, a Dolloi, a Sirdar or a Wahadadar as the case may be, of any
Elaka.

(b) "Custom" with reference to any Elaka means any rule regarding the appointment of a Chief or
Headman for that Elaka which having been continuously and uniformly observed for a long time,

has obtained the force of law in that Elaka.

OOO

(g) "Elaka" means any administrative unit in the District specified in Appendixes I, II and III or any
other administrative unit to be constituted and declared as such by the Executive Committee."

Section 3 reads as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 3Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

"3. Elections and Appointment of Chiefs and Headmen. - Subject to the provision of this Act and the
Rules made thereunder all elections and appointments of Chiefs or Headmen shall be in accordance
with the existing customs prevailing in the Elaka concerned."

All appointments of Chiefs are made subject to the approval of the District Council which may
confirm such appointments under terms and conditions which it may by Rules, from time to time,
adopt.

 

 

 

Under Appendix CII Jowai has been specified as an Elaka, headed by a Chief who would be a
Dolloi. Apart from challenging the constitutional validity of Section 3 of the Act of 1959, appellants
also challenge the validity of the notice issued by the Secretary of Executive Committee of Jowai
District dated September 4, 2001 which is reproduced below :
 

"OFFICE OF THE JAINTIA HILLS AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT COUNCIL, JOWAI NOTICE DATED
JOWAI, THE 4TH SEPT. 2001 This is Public Notice that the Executive Committee, Jaintia Hills
Autonomous District Council, Jowai after thorough investigation and scrutinisation has decided that

It is not disputed before us that Dolloi performs Administrative as well as religious functions and a
Christian cannot perform the religious functions which are performed by Dolloi. However, the
appellants have impunged Section 3 of the Act of 1959 and the notifications issued on the following
grounds:
i) The Notification issued is a law within the meaning of Article 13 (3) (a) of the Constitution of
India.

ii) Being a law preventing a person belonging to a particular religion from contesting election to a
public post is violative of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India, and therefore, void.

iii) Section 3 which provides for the Election and Appointment of Dolloi in accordance with custom
is void since the customs itself clearly discriminates on the ground of religion. A custom must give
way to fundamental right and any custom which offends the fundamental rights of a citizen must be
held to be invalid.

On the other hand learned counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that there is no
violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India since reasonable classification is
permissible in law and the exclusion of Christians from contesting the election is not only on the
ground of religion, but on the ground that they are unable to perform religious functions of the
office of Dolloi. It is further submitted that indeed the provisions only serve to conserve the tribal
culture which itself is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 29 of the Constitution of India.
In substance, the impugned law and the notifications do not incur the wrath of Articles 14 to 16 of
the Constitution, on the contrary, they enjoy the protection of Article 29 of the Constitution of India.

On a consideration of the material placed before it the High Court came to the conclusion that a
custom prevailed in the Elaka Jowai which on account of its long practice and by common consent
acquired the status of a governing rule for election and appointment of Dolloi to perform both
administrative and religious functions. The fact that the Dolloi in Elaka Jowai is required to perform
both administrative and the religious functions as prevalent by custom is not disputed. What was
submitted on behalf of the appellants was that 2 persons could be called upon to perform those
duties, one performing the administrative duties and the other the religious functions. Only 2
instances were cited when Christians were appointed as Dolloi of Elaka Jowai. In the year 1890 an
attempt was made to install a person who had converted himself into Chiristianity as Dolloi of Elaka
Jowai, but he had to face the wrath of the people in performing the religious functions and
ultimately had to resign from the post. In the other case the Dolloi had to be removed by issuance of
an order of termination. The High Court found that since time immemorial the custom is to appoint
one Dolloi who has to perform both administrative as well as religious functions. Moreover under
the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and
Headmen) Act, 1959 (Act No.11 of 1959) "service land" and "puja land" were given to Dolloi who was
appointed as the "Chief". "Service land" which was revenue free land was held and cultivated by the
Chief or the Headman in lieu of monetary remuneration for services rendered. "Puja land" was
revenue free land held and cultivated by him and the income yielded therefrom utilized by him in
meeting expenses connected with the religious performances according to customs of the Elaka. The

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 5Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

High Court, therefore, recorded a finding that there was a custom prevalent for a long period which
was invariably practiced to the effect that the "Chief", namely the Dolloi must perform
administrative as well as religious duties. There was no customs to appoint two Dollois Lone for the
performance of administrative duties and the other for the performance of religious functions.
Deviation for a short period on account of existing emergency which needed immediate correction
did not derogate from its character as a custom. The High Court concluded thus :
 

"On reading Section 3 read with Section 2(j) and 2(k) of the Act, 1959 and on the pleadings of the
parties we hold that the Dolloi elected and appointed in Elaka Jowai was required to perform the
executive function as well as religious functions which is a custom prevalent in the Elaka. We further
hold that there cannot be two Dollois one performing the administrative functions and the other
performing the religious functions. Under the Act, 1959 there can be only one Dolloi performing
both administrative as well as religious functions". An argument was advanced before the High
Court, which was not advanced before us, that the notice issued on September 4, 2001 by the
Secretary, Executive Committee, of the Jowai Autonomous District Council was without jurisdiction
and authority. The High Court negatived the contention and held that the Executive Committee in
exercise of its delegated powers can issue such a public notice for appointment by election of
Dolloiship in Elaka Jowai in the absence of rules, regulations or enactments providing for such
election and appointment. Reliance was placed on a judgment of this Court in Edwingson Bareh vs.
The State of Assam and others (supra). However, the High Court held that any
law/regulation/rule/notification made or action taken under the Sixth Schedule by the District
Council or the Executive Committee formed by the District Council must not in any manner commit
a breach of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution of India.

The High Court then proceeded to consider the submission urged before it that the exclusion of
Christians from contesting election to the post of Dolloi violated Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the
Constitution of India. In doing so the High Court also noticed Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution
of India and ultimately concluded that there was no breach of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the
Constitution of India and in fact it protected the rights guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of the
Constitution of India.

The appellants in these appeals have challenged the correctness of the decision of the High Court.

Shri P.K. Goswami, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the District Council (respondents
1 to 3) submitted that the High Court was right in holding that having regard to the facts of the case
and the nature of the office of Dolloi, the notice excluding Christians from contesting for the post of
Dolloi was fully justified. Dolloi performs administrative as well as religious functions. Such a
custom and such an office existed since time immemorial and acquired the status of well preserved
custom. It, therefore, became the duty of the State to ensure the right guaranteed under Article 26 of
the Constitution of India. This was not really a case to which Articles 15 and 16 were applicable, but
even assuming that to be so, there was no discrimination since the exclusion of Christians was not
only on the ground of religion, but on the ground that they could not perform the religious functions
of the office which by custom a Dolli was required to perform. It is submitted that under Articles 14,
15 and 16 of the Constitution of India reasonable classification was permissible. In particular he

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 6Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

drew our attention to Article 26(b) of the Constitution of India and submitted that since the office of
Dolloi involves the performance of both the administrative as well as religious duties, the concerned
tribes had a right to manage their own affairs in matter of religion. He relied upon authorities in
support of his submission that the right of the tribes to have a Dolloi who could perform
administrative as well as religious functions was a right guaranteed under Article 26 of the
Constitution of India.

Mr. R.F. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondents 5 and 6 analysed the
provisions of Articles 14, 15, 16, 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution of India and submitted that Article
14 permitted reasonable classification in accordance with well settled principles. Article 15 was a
species of Article 14 inasmuch it prohibited the State from discriminating against any citizen on the
ground only of religion, race, caste, sex place of birth or any of them. However, he emphasized the
use of the words "on ground only of religion". Thus if a citizen is discriminated against "on ground
only of religion", such action may be unconstitutional. That however, is not the case here. The
exclusion is on account of the admitted fact that a Christian cannot perform the religious duties of a
Dolloi. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment but clause (5)
thereof expressly provides that nothing in the article shall affect the operation of any law which
provides that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religious or
denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall be a person
professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination. He submitted that the
right guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution was subject to other provisions of Part III of
the Constitution of India but so far as Article 26 was concerned, it was only subject to public order,
morality and health. So far as Article 29 is concerned it is a absolute right guaranteed for the
conservation of a language, script or culture. He submitted that the rights protected are those
guaranteed under Article 26(b) and 29(1) of the Constitution. He, therefore, submitted that election
of a tribal head with all concomitants thereof was part of the tribal culture. The Constitution
guarantees uniformity in diversity. The cultural rights under Article 29 of the Constitution of India
are couched in the widest language unlike under Articles 25 and 26, which are subject to certain
limitations. Having regard to the nature of duties to be performed by a Dolloi the person elected as
Dolloi must be religiously proficient to perform his religious duties. It was really with a view to
preserve their culture that a Christian was excluded from contesting the office of Dolloi which
involved performance of religious duties, which he could not perform. It was a core aspect of the
tribal culture that Dolloi must perform administrative functions as well as religious functions which
involve performance of religious ceremonies which the High Court has elaborated in great detail.
According to him, Articles 14 to 16 were not at all breached and in the ultimate analysis the right
guaranteed under Article 29 must prevail since it is the mandate of Article 29 that such cultural
rights must be preserved. There is force in the submissions advanced on behalf of the respondents.

Article 14 ensures equality before law, which means that only persons who are in like circumstances
should be treated equally. To treat equally those who are not equal would itself be violative of Article
14 which embodies a rule against arbitrariness. Thus classification is permissible if it satisfies the
twin test of its being founded on intelligible differentia, which in turn has a rational nexus with the
object sought to be achieved.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 7Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

Article 15 prohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen on grounds only of religion,
race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. This, however, is subject to the exception carved out by
clauses 3 and 4 which permit special provisions to be made in favour of women and children, and
for socially and educationally backward classes of citizens i.e. for the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes. These are exceptions to the rule embodied in clauses (1) and (2) of Article 15.

Article 16 also embodies the rule against discrimination, but is limited in its scope than Article 15,
since it is confined to office or employment under the State, whereas Article 15 covers the entire
range of State activities. Descent and residence are the two additional grounds on which
discrimination is not permissible under Article 16. But the rule is again subject to the exceptions
carved out by clauses 3 to 5 thereof. Clause 5 is relevant for our purpose, and it provides as under :
"(5) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any law which provides that the incumbent of
an office in connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational institution or any member
of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a
particular denomination."

Thus Article 14 lays down the rule of equality in the widest term, while Article 15 prohibit
discrimination on grounds specified therein but covering the entire range of State activities. Article
16 embodies the same rule but is narrower in its scope since it is confined to State activities relating
to office or employment under the State. Both Articles 15 and 16 operate subject to exceptions
therein. It has been so laid down by this Court in Government of A.P. vs. P.B. Vijayakumar and
another : (1995) 4 SCC 520 and in Cazula Dasaratha Rama Rao vs. State of Andhra Pradesh and
others : AIR 1961 SC 564.

Counsel for the appellants submitted that prohibition against contesting for the post of Dolloi on the
ground of religion ex-facie amounted to discrimination on the ground of religion. On the contrary
the respondents contend that the exclusion is not on the ground of religion alone, and therefore,
does not invite the wrath of Articles 15 and 16. The exclusion is justified on the ground that those
who cannot perform the dual nature of functions of the Dolloi, namely administrative and religious
cannot be eligible for the post. The exclusion, therefore, is neither arbitrary nor irrational. It is
axiomatic that one who cannot perform the duties attached to the office must be held to be ineligible
to hold the office. His exclusion, therefore, cannot be considered as either unreasonable or arbitrary
or discriminatory.

 

 

 

 

The submission urged on behalf of the respondents must be accepted. We have earlier noticed the
findings of the High Court to the effect that it is the tribal custom of the Elaka that the Dolloi of the
Elaka Jowai must perform both the administrative and religious functions of his office. The High
Court has exhaustively considered the evidence on record and considered the various rituals and
observances, practices, poojas, ceremonies, customary religious functions which are regarded as
integral part of religious customs, and which the Dolloi must perform in the discharge of his duties
as the Dolloi. Such rituals, observances, ceremonies etc. are many in number. The material on
record leaves no room for doubt that the office of Dolloi with its dual functions, administrative and
religious, is a part of the tribal religion and culture, governed by custom since time immemorial. It

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 8Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

logically follows that the Dolloi must be one who is conversant with the indigenous religious
practices of the inhabitants of the Elaka. He must be one who should be able to lead the people of
the Elaka in the religious ceremonies according to their custom, and must also be competent to
perform the rituals, practices, poojas, ceremonies etc. which he is required to perform as a duty
attached to his office. It is not disputed that a Christian cannot perform the indigenous religious
functions which a Dolloi is required to perform, apart from his administrative functions. By long
standing custom, the Dolloi must perform both administrative and religious functions, and such
duties cannot be bifurcated by appointing one other to perform the religious functions only. There is
no such custom prevalent in the Elaka. In its long history, such a thing happened only twice, and on
both occasions there was a public outcry resulting in dismissal of the Dolloi in one case and his
resignation in the other. The custom cannot be said to be discontinued or destroyed by such
aberrations. The High Court has also noticed the judicial recognition given to the customary practice
in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills that a Dolloi cannot be a Christian.

Having regard to all these facts, we are in agreement with the High Court that by excluding
Christians from contesting the post of Dolloi, Articles 14, 15 and 16 are not violated. The exclusion is
justified by goond reason, since admittedly the religious duties of a Dolloi of Elaka Jowai cannot be
performed by a Christian. Thus the ground for exclusion of Christians is not solely the ground of
religion, but on account of the admitted fact that a Christian cannot perform the religious functions
attached to the office of Dolloi. The reason cannot be said to be either unreasonable or arbitrary.

Counsel for the appellants relied upon the decision of this Court in John Vallamattom and another
vs. Union of India : (2003) 6 SCCC 611, wherein this Court considered the challenge to the
constitutional validity of Section 118 of the Succession Act, 1925. The aforesaid provision was struck
down by this Court on the ground of arbitrariness violating Article 14 of the Constitution. It found
that even the classification of the Christians as a class by themselves was neither based on any
intelligible differentia nor had any nexus with the object sought to be achieved. It was, therefore,
held to be discriminatory as also arbitrary. But the challenge based on Article 15 of the Constitution
was repelled in the following words :
"So far as the second argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is concerned, it is suffice to
say that Article 15 of the Constitution of India may not have any application in the instant case as
the discrimination forbidden thereby is only such discrimination as is based, inter alia, on the
ground that a person belongs to a particular religion. The said right conferred by clause (1) of Article
15 being only on a "citizen", the same is an individual right by way of a guarantee which may not be
subjected to discrimination in the matter of rights, privileges and immunities pertaining to him as a
citizen. In other words, the right conferred by Article 15 is personal. A statute, which restricts a right
of a class of citizens in the matter of testamentary disposition who may belong to a particular
religion, would, therefore, not attract the wrath of clause (1) of Article 15 of the Constitution of
India."

Mr. Nariman is, therefore, right in distinguishing this case on facts and the nature of legislation
challenged and the infirmities found. In fact, as he rightly submits, this decision, if at all, supports

the case of the respondents, so far as challenge based on Article 15 is concerned.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 9Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

The appellants next relied on the decision of this Court in Madhu Kishwar and others vs. State of
Bihar and others : (1996) 5 SCC 125. In that case the constitutional validity of Sections 7, 8 and 76 of
the Chotanagar Tenancy Act, 1908 was challenged on the ground that the provisions violated
Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The right to intestate succession of Scheduled
Tribe Women was governed by custom. Sections 7 and 8 provided for exclusive right of male
succession to the tenancy rights. Section 76 of the Act saved any custom, usage, or customary right
not inconsistent with, or not expressly or by necessary implication modified or abolished by the
provisions of the Act. This Court did not consider it desirable to declare the customs of tribal
inhabitants as offending Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India, though each case must be
examined when full facts are placed before the Court. This Court however gave some relief to female
dependents by declaring that upon the death of the male tenant, they could hold on to the land so
long as they remained dependent on it for earning their livelihood, for otherwise it would render
them destitute. Thus the exclusive right of male succession conceived of in Sections 7 and 8 has to
remain in suspended animation so long as the right of livelihood of the female descendants of the
male holder remained valid and in vogue. We find no principle laid down in this decision to support
the case of the appellants herein, who in effect seek to challenge the validity of a custom recognized
by and given effect to, by law. On the contrary, this Court was of the view that striking down such a
law on the touchstone of Article 14 would bring about a chaos in the existing state of law.

We also do not find anything in the decision of this Court in State of Kerala and another vs.
Chandramohnan: (2004) 3 SCC 429 to support the case of the appellants. All that was held in that
case was that by mere conversion to Christanity one does not cease to be a Scheduled Tribe if despite
conversion he continues to follow the tribal traits and customs. No such question arose in this case.

None of the decisions cited by the appellants supports the challenge to Section 3 of the Act of 1959
and the Notifications impugned in the writ petitions on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 15 and
16 of the Constitution. On the other hand counsel for the respondents relied upon decisions in
support of their contention, that the exclusion of Christians from contesting the election to the post
of Dolloi in Jowai Elaka is not only on the ground of religion and, therefore, their exclusion cannot
be challenged on the ground of violating Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It was also
contended that historical reasons may as well support the classification, provided it is rational and
bears a nexus with the object sought to be achieved. It was submitted that what was sought to be
protected was indeed the tribal culture of the people inhabiting the autonomous District of Jowai.
Their tribal sentiments and religious values have been sought to be protected and given due respect
having regard to social and economic considerations of the tribals inhabiting in the autonomous
District. Thus they contend that the exclusion is not based only on the ground of religion and
consequently there is no discrimination within the meaning of Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution
of India. In this connection they have relied upon a decision of this Court in Air India vs. Nergesh
Meerza and others : (1981) 4 SCC 335 wherein this Court observed :
"Even otherwise, what Articles 15(1) and 16(2) prohibits is that discrimination should not be made
only and only on the ground of sex. These articles of the Constitution do not prohibit the State from
making discrimination on the ground of sex coupled with other considerations. On this point, the
matter is no longer res integra but is covered by several authorities of this Court."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 10Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

In Clarence Pais and others vs. Union of India : (2001) 4 SCC 325 the challenge to Section 213 and
57 of the Succession Act, 1925 was considered and repelled. No doubt this Court held that the basis
of the challenge, namely Lithat Section 213(1) of the Act was applicable only to Christians and not to
any other religion, was not correct. However, the Court made pertinent observations in the following
words :
 

 

 

 

"We have shown above that it is applicable to Parsis after the amendment of the Act in 1962 and to
Hindus who reside within the territories which on 1.9.1870 were subject to the Lt. Governor of
Bengal or to areas covered by original jurisdiction of the High Courts of Bombay and Madras and to
all wills made outside those territories and limits so far as they relate to immovable property situate
within those territories and limits. If that is so, it cannot be said that the section is exclusively
applicable only to Christians and, therefore, it is discriminatory. The whole foundation of the case is
thus lost. The differences are not based on any religion but for historical reasons that in the British
Empire in India, probate was required to prove the right of a legatee or an executor but not in Part
"B" or "C" States. That position has continued even after the Constitution has come into force.
Historical reasons may justify differential treatment of separate geographical regions provided it
bears a reasonable and just relation to the matter in respect of which differential treatment is
accorded. Uniformity in law has to be achieved, but that is a long drawn process. Undoubtedly, the
States and Union should be alive to this problem. Only on the basis that some differences arise in
one or the other States in regard to testamentary succession, the law does not become
discriminatory so as to be invalid. Such differences are bound to arise in a federal set up."

In R.C. Poudyal vs. Union of India and others : 1994 Supp. (1) SCC 324 reservation of one seat for
the Sangha in the Sikkim Assembly was challenged. In the reply it was urged that though Sangha
was essentially a religious institution of the Buddhists, it however, occupied a unique position in the
political, social and cultural life of the Sikkimese Society and the one seat reserved for it cannot,
therefore, be said to be based on considerations ‘only’ of religion. This Court repelled the contention
that reservation of one seat in favour of the Sangha is one purely based on religious considerations
and, therefore, violative of Articles 15(1) and 325 of the Constitution of India and offended its
secular principles. This Court held :- "The Sangha, the Buddha and the Dharma are the three
fundamental postulates and symbols of Buddhism. In that sense they are religious institutions.
However, the literature on the history of development of the political institutions of Sikkim adverted
to earlier tend to show that the Sangha had played an important role in the political and social life of
the Sikkimese people. It had made its own contribution to the Sikkimese culture and political
development. There is material to sustain the conclusion that the ‘Sangha’ had for long associated
itself closely with the political developments of Sikkim and was inter-woven with the social and
political life of its people. In view of this historical association, the provisions in the matter of
reservation of a seat for the Sangha recognises the social and political role of the institution more
than its purely religious identity. In the historical setting of Sikkim and its social and political
evolution the provision has to be construed really as not invoking the impermissible idea of a
separate electorate either. Indeed, the provision bears comparison to Art. 333 providing for
representation for the Anglo-Indian community. So far as the provision for the Sangha is concerned,
it is to be looked at as enabling a nomination but the choice of the nominee being left to the 'Sangha'
itself. We are conscious that a separate electorate for a religious denomination would be obnoxious

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/229719/ 11Ewanlangki-E-Rymbai vs Jaintia Hills District Council ... on 28 March, 2006

to the fundamental principles of our secular Constitution. If a provision is made purely on the basis
of religious considerations for election of a member of that religious group on the basis of a separate
electorate, that would, indeed, be wholly unconstitutional. But in the case of Sangha, it is not merely
a religious institution. It has been historically a political and social institution in Sikkim and the
provisions in regard to the seat reserved admit of being construed as a nomination and the Sangha
itself being assigned the task of and enabled to indicate the choice of its nominee. The provision can
be sustained on this construction. Contention (g) is answered accordingly."

These decisions do justify the stand of the respondents that unless it is shown that the exclusion of
Christians was only on religious ground, the challenge cannot be sustained. In the instant case, we
have noticed the reasons why such an exclusion was made and we have also held that the reasons
therefor are neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. We, therefore, conclude agreeing with the High
Court that Section 3(1) of the Act of 1959 as also the Notifications impugned in the writ petitions
cannot be struck down on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of
India.

We may notice that the High Court has held that the spiritual fraternity represented by classes
belonging to Niam Tynrai Niamtre (Non- christian) who practice the indigenous religion within the
Raij Jowai is a socio cultural religious organization of Jaintia people who follow Niam Tynrai
Niamtre faith. They are governed by common customary laws of their own in the matters of
administration as well in following religious faith. These classes within the Raij Jowai being
followers of Niam Tynrai Niamtre are certainly a religious denomination within the meaning of
Article 26 of the Constitution of India.

Before us also, Mr. Goswami, learned counsel appearing for the respondents urged submissions
based on Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India. Mr. Nariman, however, laid emphasis on
Article 29 of the Constitution of India and submitted that the effort was really to conserve the
culture of the tribal population in the autonomous District and, therefore, protected by Article 29 of
the Constitution of India. These are matters which may require consideration in an appropriate
case. So far as the instant case is concerned, having found that the challenge to the impugned
provisions and Notifications was not sustainable on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16
of the Constitution of India, it is not necessary for us to deal with other issues which the respondents
have urged on the basis of Articles 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution of India in support of their
stand.

In the result these appeals fail and are dismissed.

HEADNOTE:

The Central Government had in the year 1949 demarcated
the press area along the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.
It consisted of plots Nos.. 1 to 10 known as Press Enclave
as a commercial complex. These plots were alloted to various
newspapers like the Indian Express, Times of India, Patriot,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

National Herald etc. Petitioner No.1, Express Newspapers
Private Ltd., engaged in the business of printing and
publishing a national newspaper, Indian Express (Delhi
Edition), was alloted plot nos 9-10 Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg,
New Delhi by an indenture styled as an “agreement for lease
executed on May 26, 1954 between the petitioner and the
Secretary (Local self-government) to the Chief Commissioner
of Delhi by the orders and directions of the President of
India for the construction of a four storeyed building meant
to be used for a newspaper.
384

At the time of construction of buildings in the press
area there were no restrictions as to the Floor Area Ratio
(FAR) permissible along the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and the
only restriction on construction of building in that area
was that the allottees of the plots should construct
buildings up to a height of 60 feet. The Express Newspapers
Pvt. Ltd. was allowed to build upon the entire area of plots
Nos. 9 and 10 with a ground coverage of 100%, that is, edge
to edge, a structure with a minimum of five storeys
including the ground floor for the purpose of installation
of a printing press for publication of a Hindi newspaper.
This permission was granted in response to the plans
submitted by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. and approved
in writing by the Chief Commissioner of Delhi acting for
and on behalf of the lessor, that 18, the Union of India.

During the preliminary work of construction by the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. an underground sewer line was
found to be running diagonally across plot nos. 9 and 10. It
was agreed between the parties vide lease agreement dated
November 19 1957 that in view of the underground drain
running through the plots
the Express Buildings would be constructed only to the East
of the drain till the drain was diverted. In effect, an area
of 2740 square yards to the West of the drain had to be left
open as_ residual plot of the land out of a total area of
5703 square yards. The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
constructed the old Express Building to the East of the
sewer line with an FAR of 260 with reference to the entire
plot leased to lt i.e.. plots Nos. 9 ant 10 although the
building occupied only half of the area. On March 17, 1958
another perpetual lease was executed by Assistant Secretary
(LSG) to the Chief Commissioner, Delhi by the order and
direction of the President of India demising on behalf of
the Union of India in perpetuity the Nazul land described
therein in consideration of payment of a premium and yearly
rent. Likewise, the earlier agreement dated November 19,
1957 80 also the supplementary agreement of May 26, 1954
were also executed by the salt Officer in the same manner.
Both the agreements stipulated that the rules, regulations
ant laws of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi relating to
buildings which may be in force from time to time shall be
confirmed to by the lessee.

On November 6, 1959 all functions relating to
administration of leases of Government lands in Delhi were
transferred from the Chief Commissioner of Delhi (LSG) to
the Ministry of Works 6 Housing.

In the year 1977, petitioner No.l, the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd., approached the Municipal Corporation
of Delhi for
385
shifting the sewer line outside plots 08. 9 and 10 and also
moved the lessor, the Union of India, Ministry of Works and
housing for grant of requisite sanction to construct the new
Express Building with an FAR of 40. The Chief Engineer,
Delhi Water Supply ant Sewage Disposal Undertaking granted
approval to the diversion of the sewer line at the cost of
petitioner No-l. Thereafter, petitioner No.1, informed the
Ministry of Works and Housing about the aforesaid approval
granted by the Municipal lt Corporation of Delhi and
requested the Ministry for advice on the FAR permissible for
the said building. The matter was processed in the Ministry
of Works and Housing at various leveling ultimately on
October 21, 1978, the Vice-Chairman , Delhi Development
authority took the following decision (a) to amalgamate
plots Nos.9 and 10.and taking into account the existing
built-up area would permit the FAR of 360 overall; (b) to
allow the residual area of plots Nos.9 and 10 to be built
in line with the Times of India and Shama Building; (c) to
exclude the basement from the calculation of the FAR
provided the basements are for office purposes; (d) to per
lt permit on the service road in the same manner as it was
for the other building in this line. The Vice-Chairman
further directed that the aforesaid order was to be treated
as one under special appeal. He accordingly gave instruction
for issuing ‘No Objection’ to petitioner No-l for
construction on the residual area and to make a referenceto the Government of India asking for confirmation of the
action proposed in view of the order of the Minister for
Works and Housing to clear the cases immediately and to
obtain his ex post facto sanction. On November 4, 1978 the
Joint Director (Buildings) Delhi Development Authority
issued a "No Objection Certificate to the petitioners and
the Ministry of Works ant Housing granted it ex post facto
approval on November 24, 1978. Thereafter, petitioner KNOB
constructed its new Express Building.

On February 17, 1980, respondent No.2 Jagmohan assumed
office at the Lt. Governor of Delhi and on the same evening,
he summoned the Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi and called for the files relating to the construction
of the new Express Building at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New
Delhi. On the next day, the necessary files were made
available. On February 20, 1980, some important files of the
Delhi Development Authority relating to the Express
Buildings were sent to respondent No.2. On February 29,
1980, respondent No.2 through the Commissioner MUNICIPAL

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Corporation of Delhi caused the locks of the office and
cupboards of the Zonal Engineer (Building) to be broken open
to

386

take away the file relating to the new Express Building. On
March 1, 1980 respondent No.2 convened a press conference in
which he handed over a press release alleging (1) that the
new Express Building put up by the petitioner FAS in
contravention of law in several respects; (11) that he had
ordered an inquiry to be made by a committee of three of his
subordinate officials and (111) that the new Express
Building might have to be demolished. On the same day,
although the relevant files had been removed from his
office, the Zonal Engineer (Buildings), City Zone, Municipal
Corporation of Delhi served a notice on petitioner No.1, to
show cause why action should not be taken for demolition of
the Express Buildings under 88. 343 and 344 of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. On March 4, 1980, a second
press release was issued from the Raj Nivas, to justify the
action of respondent No.2 in initiating the inquiry. The
issue of show cause notice again figured in a third press
release dated March 8, 1980. The Ministry of Works and
Housing also submitted the files relating to the
construction of the New Express Building to respondent No.2
on March 7, 1980. On March 1, 1980 the Engineer Officer in
the Land and Development Office under the Ministry of Works
and Housing also issued a notice to the petitioners to show
cause within 30 days as to why the property should not be
re-entered under clause 5 of the perpetual lease on the
grounds: (1) that the construction of the New Express
Building was without permission from the lessor under the
terms of lease; (ii) that the plans were not submitted for
the sanction under the terms of lease by the lessor; and
(iii) that the plans were in contravention of cl.2(5) and
2(14) of the lease deed. On March 12, 1980 at a specially
convened Press Conference, respondent No.2 released the
report of the Committee of his subordinates which
substantiated the view of respondent No.2 and also found
that petitioner No.1 was liable to pay Rs. 35 lacs as
conversion charges.

The petitioners challenged the validity of the
aforesaid two notices before the Supreme Court under Art.32
of the Constitution on the grounds: (i) That the Lt.Governor
appointed by the President under. 239(1) of the
Constitution 18 an Administrator and he discharges such
functions as are entrusted to him by the President of India
and in the absence of a notification under Art. 239(1), the
Lt. Governor cannot usurp the functions of the Union of
India in relation to the properties of the Union: (11) that
the Lieutenant-Governor 1 not a successor of the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi. There was notification issued by the
President under Art. 239(1) of the Constitution for
387

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

the conferral of any power on the Lt. Governor to administer
the lease in question; (ill) that lt is inconceivable that
after October 1, 1959 when the administrative control over
the Land Development Officer was transferred from the Delhi
Administration to the Ministry of Works Housing and by
virtue of a notification issued under Art. 299(1) the
Secretary, Ministry of Works Housing was made the competent
authority tc act for the President with regard to any
contract, grant or as assurance or property of the Union,
the Lt.Governor could still arrogate to himself the powers
of the Union of India, Ministry of Works Housing in relation
to the lease; (lv) that respondent No.2, Jagmohan, is
actuated with personal bias against the Indian Express which
had published an article in the Indian Express in April 1977
with regard to his role during the period of Emergency in
Turkman Gate demolitions. The proposed action of re-entry by
the lessor i.e. the Union of India Ministry of works &
Housing at the instance of the Lt. Governor of Delhi is an
act of political vendetta. The impugned notices have been
issued with an evil eye and an unequal hand and with a
deliberate design to compel the petitioners to close down
the Express Group of Newspapers in general and the Indian
Express in particular. The said notice are ex-facie illegal
and without prediction and are contrary to facts and legal
provision . The arbitrary and discriminatory initiation of
executive action under the guise of alleged infraction of
the terms of the lease auditor the Master Plan of Delhi and
or the Municipal building bye-law is violative of the
petitioners' fundamental rights under Arts.14,19(1) (a) and
19(1)(g) of the Constitution; (v) that the impugned notice
issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building) City Zone, Municipal
Corporation of Delhi Dated March 1,1980 was illegal and void
as he did not apply his mind at all to the question at issue
but merely issued the same at the instance of respondent
No.2. The construction of the said building was not without
or contrary to the sanction referred to in s.336 or in
contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or byelaws mate thereunder; (vi) that the erection of the double
basement or a working platform in a printing press like the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. is a compoundable deviation
from the sanctioned plan and the insistence of the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi to demolish the same suffers from the
vice of hostile discrimination. (vii) that the construction
of the new express Building its an increased FAR of 360 was
in conformity with clause 2(5) of the perpetual lease dated
March 17,1958 inasmuch as it was with the express sanction
of the lessor i.e. the Union of India. In terms of the
Government of India (Allocation of Business Rule, 1961 as
well

388

as under a notification issued under Art.299(1), the
Ministry of Works & Housing with the Minister at the head
was and is the ultimate authority responsible to deal with

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

the property of the Union and to enter into all contractual
obligations relating thereto. The Minister had not only full
authority, power and jurisdiction to grant permission to the
petitioners to construct

the new Express building with an increased FAR of 360 with
a double basement for the installation of the printing
press, but the action taken by the then Government was in
good faith after taking into consideration all the
circumstances attendant at all levels. (viii) that there
could be no objection to the construction of the new Express
Building with an increased FAR of 360 as it allowed the
residual area of plots Nos. 9 and 10 to be built in line
with other building along the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.
Further, the Master Plan for Delhi subsequently approved by
the Central Government in the year 1962 does not mention the
pre area on the Bahadur Shah Zafar are comprising of the
press enclave. although specified as a commercial area, it
is not listed in the list of already built-up commercial
areas because it is relates to the walled city of old Delhi.
The Zonal development plan for D-II area within which the
pre- plots are located also permitted an FAR of 400 for the
press area in the Bahadur Shah Zafar marg. Therefore , all
that the then Minister for Works & Housing did was to
restore to the petitioners the right that they acquired
under the perpetual lease dated March 17, 1958 i.e. to be
treated alike alongwith other plot-holders in that area and
a denial of such equal terms would be opposed to the
principles of equality besides being violative of Art.14 of
the Constitution. (ix) That the Express Building at 9-10
Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg forms the nerve-centre of the
Express Group of Newspapers as the editorials and the
leading articles of the Indian press are sent out and the
editorial policy laid down from Delhi office to ten centres
all over India. In this factual background, the impugned
notices have a direct impact on the freedom of the press and
being in excess of governmental authority and colourable
exercise of statutory powers, are liable to be struck down
is offending Art.19(1) (a) red with Art.14 of the
Constitution. (X) that the lessor i.e. the Union of India is
estoppel by the doctrine of promissory estoppel and cannot
therefore go back upon all assurances given and actions
taken by the previous government, particularly when the
petitioners had acted upon the decisions so reached and had
constructed the new Express Building with a cost of
approximately Rs. 1.30 crores by February 1980 which at
present would cost more than Rs 3 crores.
389

It was contended on behalf of respondent No.1, the

Union of India; (1) that the right to occupy the land leased
for the construction of a building for installation of a
printing press is not within Art. 19(1)(a) nor within Art.
19(1)(g) but such a right is derived from a grant or
contract; (2) That the right arising out of a statute or out

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

of a contract cannot be a fundamental right itself. Once a
contract is entered into or a grant is mate, the rights and
obligations of the parties are not government by Part III of
the Constitution but by the term of the document embodying
the contract or the grant, and any complaint about its
breach cannot be a matter for grant of a writ, direction or
order under Art. 226 of the Constitution, such less and.
Art.32, ant since the petitioners are seeking to enforce a
contractual right, 1t cannot be decided on a petition under

Art. 32 of the Constitution. (3) That the content of Art.
19(1)(g) of the constitution would not include the right
which 1 guarantee by other clauses of Art.19 (4). That the

argument of the petitioners that the building in question is
necessary for running the press and any statutory or
executive action to pull it down or forfeit the lease would
directly impinge on the right of freedom of speech ant
expression under Art. 19(1)(g) 18 wholly misconceived
inasmuch as every activity that may be necessary for
exercise of freedom of speech and expression or that may
facilitate such exercise or make lt meaningful ant effective
cannot be elevated to the status of a fundamental right. (5)
That the right to the land and the right to construct
buildings thereon for running a printing press are not
derived from Art. 19(1) (a) but spring from the terms of the
grant of such lands by the Government under the provisions
of the Government grants Act, 1895 and regulated by other
laws governing the subject viz. the Delhi Development Act,
1957 the Master Plan ant the Zonal Development Plan framed
thereunder, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 and
the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Building) Bye-laws, 1959
which regulate construction of buildings in the Union
Territory of Delhi irrespective of the purpose for which the
building 18 constructed. (6) That the right to run a press
may be a fundamental right guaranteed under . Art. 19(1) (a)
or Art. 19(1)(g) but the right to use a particular building
for running a press is altogether another thing inasmuch as
no particular building is equally fit for the running of the
press and the person desiring to run a press or already
running the press is at liberty to acquire another suitable
building for that purpose. Further, even if the buildings in
question were necessary for the enjoyment of the rights
under Art-19(1)(a) or Art. 19(1)(R) ‘a right to use a
particular building does not

390

become an integral part of the right to freedom of speech
and expression’ or the ‘right to carry on any trade of
business in printing and publishing a newspaper' and clearly
therefore the petitions under Art. 32 are not maintainable.
(7) That even on a question of fact, the direct impact of
the impugned notices will not be on the double basement
wherein printing press is installed but will be wholly or in
part on the two upper storeys which are not intended to be
used in relation to the press or for publication of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

intended Hindi newspaper but only for the purpose of letting
out the same for profit; the only other possible effect any
be the removal of the upper basement which the petitioners
call a working platform which has been constructed in
violation of the building regulations. (8) That there was no
imminent danger of demolition of the Express Building nor
was the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 issued by the
Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office, a notice of reentry upon forfeiture of lease. It was merely a notice of an
exploratory nature requiring the petitioners to show cause
why the lease should not be forfeited under cl.5 of the
lease-deed for alleged breaches of cls.- 2(5) and 2(14)
thereof. The Petitioners should have therefore entered
appearance before the Land & development Officer and showed
cause against the action proposed. It was only if the Land &
Development Officer was not satisfied with their
explanation, that he would put up the papers before the Lt.
Governor for necessary action. It would then be for the
lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing
to decide whether or not the lease should be forfeited under
cl.5 of the lease-deed. (9) That the impugned notice by the
Engineer Officer purporting to act on behalf of the lessor
i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing was not
based either on the report of the Three-Member Committee
obtained by the Lt.Governor or on the basis of any
communication from him, (10) That the Lt.Governor had no
powers in relation to the properties of the Union and,
therefore, the Union of India 1 not bound by the acts of

the Lt. Governor. The Lt. Governor had no power in relation
to the lease and, therefore, he could not usurp to himself
the powers and functions of the Union of India in relation
to the lease deed. However the Lt.Governor as_ the
Administrator had to keep himself informed and cannot be
said to have acted malafide merely because of any possible

personal malus animus on his part, if the quality of the
action was itself in complete accord with the law. (11) That
the Government itself was in possession of relevant records
and applied its mind to them and the impugned notice issued
by the Engineer Officer who was empowered to act on behalf
of the President under Act.299(1) of the Constitution

391

having been authenticated in the manner required by
Art.77(3), it must be deemed to be the decision of the
President on the advice of the Council of Ministers as
enjoined by Art.74(2) and the Court was precluded from
making any investigation into the circumstances thereto.
(12) That it was the respondent No.2 to meet the charges of
malafides levelled against him.

On behalf of respondent No.2, the Lt.Governor of Delhi,
it was argued: (1) That the Administrator appointed by the
President under Art.239(1), as amended by the Seventh
Amendment, could be called by any designation, that the
Chief Commissioner of Delhi continued to be the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi under
Art.239(1) after November 1, 1956 when the Government of
Part States Act, 1951 was replaced by 8.130 of the States
Reorganisation Act, 1956 and that he functioned as such till
September 6, 1966 since the Delhi Administration Act, 1966
continued to use the nomenclature of Administrator appointed
by the President under Art.239(1). It was for the first time
on September 7, 966 that the Administrator of the Union
Territory of Delhi who used to be designated as the Chief
Commissioner was re-designated as the Lt.Governor. (2) that
the Lt.Governor was successor of the Chief Commissioner and,
therefore, all the powers exercisable by the Chief
Commissioner in relation to the lease vested in him. (3)
That the Lt. Governor was the alter ego of the President in
relation to such territory which he is called upon to
administer on behalf of the President. One of the primary
functions of the Lt. Governor, as the Administrator, was to
be aware of facts brought to his knowledge and therefore
respondent No.2 could not have turned a blind eye to the
action of Sikander Bakht, the then Minister for Works
Housing in making a highly fraudulent, illegal and improper
grant of sanction to petitioner No.1, the Express Newspapers
Pvt. Ltd. to build the new Express Building with an
increased FAR of 360. (4) That the Lt. Governor as_ the
appointed agent or nominee of the President was entitled to
act on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of India,
Ministry of Works & Housing in relation to the lease and
therefore, he was well within his rights (a) in calling for
and making perusal of the respective files from the Ministry
of Works & Housing Delhi Development Authority and the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi pertaining to the
construction of the Express Building with an increased FAR
of 360; (b) in constituting a Three-Member Committee to
inquire into the circumstances

392

relating to the grant of sanction by the then Minister of
Work & Housing and to take necessary steps as regards the
unauthorised construction of the new Express Building; and
(c) in forwarding the report of the Three-Member Committee
to the concerned authority, meaning the Minister for Works &
Housing for taking necessary steps. (5) that the transfer of
administrative control of the L & O on October 1, 1958 to
the Ministry of Works & Housing did not divest the Chief
Commissioner of his contractual powers given under the lease
and he alone represented the lessor i.e. the Union of India
and not the Ministry of Works & Housing (6) That being the
Lt. Governor of Delhi, he was responsible for the
administration of the Union Territory of Delhi and, as such,
he was acting within his power to direct all the authorities
concerned to prevent violation of laws by any person or
institution. He further asserted that he, as the Lt.
Governor of Delhi, was fully competent to appoint the
Inquiry Committee under the Commissioner of Inquiry Act,

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

10Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

1952. (7) that the Union of India or the Lt. Governor of
Delhi never intended to inflict a reprisal on the
petitioners for the independent stand of the newspapers they
publish. (8) that the respondents had no personal animosity
towards the Express Group of Newspapers and the criminal
complaint for defamation was instituted by respondent No.2
because the Indian Express was guilty of fabricating and
publishing false, motivated, scandalous stories about
respondent No.2 and others. (9) That he had not ordered the
issuance of the notice in question and that the Land &
Development Officer was an authority independent of the
administrative control and supervision of the Lt. Governor.
As regards the impugned show cause notice issued by the
Zonal- Engineer (Building) City Zone, Municipal Corporation
of Delhi, lt was asserted that the same had been issued by
the Municipal Corporation of Delhi in exercise of its
statutory powers under 88. 343 and 344 of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act after verification of the
allegations. (10) That the perpetual lease-deed dated March
18, 1958 governs the relationship effectively between the
Union of India and the Lt. Governor on the one hand and the
petitioners on the other i.e... the contractual relations
between the parties. (11) That the sewer, according to the
terms of the lease-deed, could not be diverted without the
consent of the Chief Commissioner and the approval of the
Ministry of Works & Housing was a nullity being without
jurisdiction and legal competence. (12) that for the
commercial user of the residual area to be kept as ‘green
it is only the Chief Commissioner (Lt. Governor) who could
give
393
sanction to construct for the commercial user at the
residual area; the petitioners were liable to pay commercial
realization changes; and (13) that lt is for the Chief
Commissioner (Lt. Governor) to decide if the breaches were
remediable or as to the nature of the remedies required for
the breach. Since the breaches are not remediable breaches,
the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 issued by the
Engineer Officer, L& O for re-entry upon the land on
forfeiture of the lease for breach of the conditions was
valid and proper.

Counsel for respondent No.4, Municipal Corporation of
Delhi, urged (1) that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. have
no right to construct the upper basement particularly when
the Corporation refused to accord sanction to it and that,
in any event, it was not such an unavoidable necessity as to
break the Law; and (2) that even if some receiving floor may
perhaps be necessary to receive the printed newspapers from
the machine, it would be achieved by locating the machines
on a suitable pedestal or by laying the floor of the
basement in such a manner as to discharge the newspaper on
the ground floor; and (3) that under the Master Plan and the
Building Bye-laws, not more than one basement is permissible

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

11Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

and that any basement more than one will have to be reckoned
for the purpose of FAR.

Counsel for respondent No.5 Land & Development Officer
contended (1) that under the terms of the lease deed of
1958, previous consent of either the President of India or
the Chief Commissioner (Lt. Governor) or such officer or
body as the lessor (President of India) or the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi authorised was necessary for building
activity on the residual area of the plots (2740 sq. yards).
The Ministry of Works & Housing did not represent the lessor
or the Chief Commissioner and (2) that the Land 6
Development Officer is not a functionary under the Ministry
of Works & Housing. He is the officer appointed on behalf of
the lessor to administer the lease. At no stage the
petitioners approached the office of Land & Development for
permission to construct on the residual area of 2740
sq.yards to the west of the pipe-line and no approval was
obtained from the office of L & 0 for construction of a
building in contravention of clauses 2(5), (9) and (14) of
the lease. The so-called permissions and approvals obtained
by the petitioner- have no legal competence or authority
under the terms of the lease-deed
394
which governed the relationship between the petitioners and
respondent no.1.

HELD : By the Court (Per A.P. Sen, E.S. Vankataramiah &
R.B. Misra, J.)

(1) The writ petitions under Art.32 of the Constitution
must succeed and are allowed with costs. The notice issued
by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office dated
March 10, 1980 purporting to act on behalf of the Government
of India, Ministry of Works & Housing requiring the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the lessor i.e. the
Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing should not reenter upon and take possession of plots nos. 9 and 10,
Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi together with the Express
Buildings built thereon, under cl.5 of the indenture of
lease dated Mar h 17, 1958 for alleged breaches of cls.2(5)
and 2(14) thereof, and the earlier notice dated March 1,
1980 issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone,
Municipal Corporation, Delhi requiring them to show cause
why the aforesaid buildings should not be demolished under
88.343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957,
are quashed. It is declared that the construction of the new
Express Building on the residual portion of 2740 square
yards on the western side of plots no 8. 9 and 10,
Bahadurshah Zafar Marg with an increased FAR of 360 with a
double basement for installation of a printing press for
publication of a Hindi daily newspaper was with toe
permission of the lessor i.e.. the Union of India Ministry
of Works & Housing and did not constitute a breach of

clauses 2(5) and 2(14) of the lease-deed. 554 E-; 555 Al

(2) The Lt. Governor failed to make a distinction in
this case between the power with respect to the subject
‘Property of the Union and the revenue therefrom' which is
in Entry 32 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution and the general powers of administration
entrusted to him under Article 239 of the Constitution
the administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi. The
property in question 18 a part of the estate of the Central
Government. Mere nearness to the seat of the Central
395
Government does not clothe the Lt. Governor of Delhi with
any power in respect of the property of the Central
Government. He can discharge only those powers which are
entrusted to him by the Constitution ant the Laws. It is
also not correct to claim that all the powers of the former
Chief Commissioner of Delhi have devolved on the Lt.Governor
and continue to vest in him. [556 B-D]

Per A.P.Sen, J.

1(i) Freedom of the press is comprehended within the
right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under
Art.19(1)(a). The freedom of thought and expression, and the
freedom of the press are not only valuable freedoms in
themselves but are basic to a democratic from of Government
which proceeds on the theory that problems of the Government
can be solved by the free exchange of thought and by public
discussion of the various issues facing the nation. It is
necessary to emphasize and one must not forget that the
vital importance of freedom of speech and expression
involves the freedom to dissent to a free democracy Like
ours. Democracy relies on the freedom of the press. It is
the inalienable right of everyone to comment freely upon any
matter of public importance. This right is on of the pillars
of individual Liberty-freedom of speech, which Supreme Court
has always unfailingly guarded. Howsoever precious and
cherished the freedom of speech is under Art.19(1)(a), this
freedom is not absolute and unlimited at all times and under
all circumstances but is subject to the restrictions
contained in Art.19(2). That must be 80 because unrestricted
freedom of the press and is wholly free from restraints,
amounts to uncontrolled licence which would lead to disorder
and anarchy and lt would be hazardous to ignore the vital
importance of our social and national interest in public
order and security of the State. 474 C-D; 475 D-G

1(ii) The extent of permissible limitations on this
freedom are indicated by the fundamental law of the land
itself viz. Art.19(2) of the Constitution. But, permissible
restrictions on any fundamental right guaranteed under Part
III of the Constitution have to be imposed by a duly enacted
law and must not be excessive i.e. they must not go beyond
what is necessary to achieve the object of the law under
which they are sought to be imposed. The power to imposed
restrictions on fundamental

as

13Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

396
right is essentially a power to 'regulate' the exercise of
these rights. In fact, '‘regulation' and not extinction of

that which 18 to be regulated 18, generally speaking, the
extent to which permissible restrictions any go LPN order to
satisfy the test of
reasonableness. The t. t laid down by the Supreme Court 18

whether the direct and immediate impact of the impugned
action 18 on the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed
under Art.19(1)(a) which includes the freedom of the press.

In the instant case, the very threat 18 to the
existence of a free and independent press. The impugned
notices of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease ant of the
threatened demolition of the Express Buildings are intended
and meant to silence the voice of the Indian Express. It
must logically follow that the impugned notices constitute a
direct ant immediate threat to the freedom of the press ant
are thus violative of Art.19(1)(a) read with Art.14 of the
Constitution. It must accordingly be held that these
petitions under Art.32 of the Constitution are maintainable.

(4) (ii) There can be no doubt whatever on a_ true
construction of the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980
that the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office
purporting to act on behalf of the lessor i.e.. the Union of
India, Ministry of Works Housing served a notice of re-entry
upon forfeiture of lease under cl.5 of the lease-deed. There
was no question of the said motley being construed to be of
an exploratory nature. Since respondent No.2 is not the
successor of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi nor has any
function in relation to the lease, there is no warrant for
the suggestion that prior approval of the Lt. Governor is a
condition precedent to the right of the lessor i.e. the
Union of India to exercise its right of re-entry upon
forfeiture of lease under cl.5 of the lease-deed. [480 B-D]

4.(iii) The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. having acted
upon the grant of permission by the lessor i.e. the Union of
India, Ministry of Works & Housing to construct the new
Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 together with
a double basement was clearly not an unauthorized occupant
within the meaning of s.2(g) of the Act. The Express
Buildings constricted by Express- Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. with
the sanction of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry
of Works & Housing on plots No-. 9 ant 10 Bahadurshah Zafar
Marg demised on perpetual lease by registered lease-deed
dated March 17, 1958 can, by no process of reasoning, be
regarded as public premises belonging to the Central
Government ouster s.2(g). That being so, there is no
question of the lessor applying for eviction of the ExpressNewspapers Pvt.

398

Ltd. under 6.5(1) of the Public Premises (Eviction of
unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 nor has the Estate Officer
any authority or jurisdiction to direct their eviction under
sub-s.(2) thereof by summary process. Due process of law in
a case like the present necessarily implies the filing of
suit by the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of
Works & Housing for the enforcement of the alleged right of
re-entry if any, upon forfeiture of lease due to breach of
the terms of the lease. However, the Government has the
power to take recourse to the provisions of the Public
Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971
where admittedly there is Unauthorized construction by a
lessee or by any other person on Government land which is
public premises within the meaning of s.2(e) and such person
is in unauthorized occupation thereof. [484 E-F; 485 A-D]

criticised.

5(i) Under the Constitution of India, Delhi became a
Part 'C' State w.e.f. January 26, 1960 and it was provided
by Art. 239(1) that a State specified in Part 'C' of the
First Schedule shall be administered by the President acting
to such extent as he thinks fit through a Chief Commissioner
or Lt. Governor to be appointed by him. [491 E-F]

Art. 239(1) of the Constitution differed from the
provision contained in s.94(3) of the Government of India
Act. 1935 to the extent that the appointment of a Chief
Commissioner or Lt . Governor as an Administrator
irrespective of the designation and entrustment of powers,
functions and duties to him by the President, were not to be
in his discretion but had to be exercised on the advice of
the Council of Ministers. Except for this, 8.94(3) of the
Government of India Act, 1935 and Art.239(1) of
Constitution as enacted were identical in respect of the
provisions for the administration of Delhi as a Chief
399
Commissioner's province under the 1935 Act and as a Part 'C'
State under the Constitution, by the Governor-General under
28.94(3) and under Art. 239(1) by the President acting to
such extent as he thought fit, “through the Chief
Commissioner or the Lt. Governor as an Administrator
irrespective of the designation 491 H; 492 A-B]

5(ii) Art. 239(1) of the Constitution was amended by
the Constitution (7th Amendment) Act, 1956 w.e.f. November
1, 1956 and for the words ‘through a Chief Commissioner or a
Lt. Governor to be appointed by him' in Art.239(1) as
originally enacted, the words substituted are ‘through a-n
administrator appointed by him with such designation as he
may specify'. Therefore, the Administrator appointed by the

the

President under Art. 239(1) whether with the designation of

the Chief Commissioner or of the Lt. Governor could exercise
only such powers, functions and duties as were entrusted to
him by the President i.e. there have to be specific
entrustment of powers by the President under Art.239(1)
From November 1, 1956 Part 'C' States ceased to exist by
virtue of the Seventh Amendment and in their place Union
Territories were substituted in the First Schedule to the
Constitution, including the Union Territory of Delhi i.e.
the territories which immediately before the commencement of
the Constitution were comprised in the Chief Commissioner's
province of Delhi. [493 A-B; D-E; 493 F-G]

5(iii) On October 1, 1959 decision was taken by the
Government of India to transfer. the administrative control
of the office Of Land & Development Officer, New Delhi from
the Delhi Administration to Ministry of Works, Housing &
Supply w.e.f. October 1, 1959. This decision was duly
communicated to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi and to the
Land & Development Officer, New Delhi. The President of
India on February 1, 1966 issued an order under Art.299(1)
of the Constitution which inter alia directed that in the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

16Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

case of Land L Development Office (1) all contracts and
assurances of property relating to batter falling within the
jurisdiction of Land L Development Officer, (2) all
contracts, deeds and other instruments relating to ant for
the purpose of enforcement of the terms and conditions of
the sale/lease-deed of the government property in Delhi/New
Delhi, etc. made in exercise of the executive power of the
Union may be executed on his behalf by the Land &
Development Officer. Therefore, neither the Chief

400

Commissioner nor the Lt. Governor hat anything to do with
the Office of the Land & Development or the administration
of nazul lands in the Union Territory of Delhi after October
1, 1959. They have not been conferred any authority by the
President under Art. 299(1) to enter into any contracts mate
in the exercise of the executive power of the Union or to
act 'on behalf of' the President in relation to such
contract or assurance of property i.e. to act on behalf of
the President for the enforcement of the terms ant
conditions thereof. There is also no notification under Art.
239(1) by the President vesting Chief Commissioner or the
Lt. Governor with any power, functions and duty in relation
to the property of the Union Territory of Delhi. [495 C-D;
F-G; E; 497 A-B]

5(iv) It would therefore, appear that the territory of
Delhi as a Part 'C' State under the First Schedule to the
Constitution was a separate and distinct constitutional
entity as from that of a Chief Commissioner Province under
the Government of India Act, 1935, and this is equally true
of the Union Territory of Delhi. It must logically follow
that with the transformation of the territory of Delhi from
a Chief Commissioner's Province under s.94(3) of the
Government of India Act, 1935 into that of a Part 'C' State
under the Constitution and after the seventh Amendment into
the Union Territory Delhi, the office of the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi disappeared and that of an

Administrator appointed by the President under Art.239(1)

with such designation as he may specify, came into
existence. The necessary concomitant is that the
Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi derived only
such powers, functions ant duties as were entrusted to him
by the President under Art.239(1). [501 C-E]

5-(v) There was no Order in Council issued by the
Governor General under 8.94(3) of the Government of India
Act, 1935 nor any Order issued by the President under Art.
239(1) of the Constitution investing the Chief Commissioner
of Delhi to deal with the property of the Union. The matters
relating to the property of the Union of India are included
in the seductive power of the Union under
Constitution read with Art.298 which expressly provides that
the seductive power of the Union shall extent to the
acquisition, holding ant disposal of

Art.53 of the

17Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

property and the making of contracts for any purpose. Such
executive power of the Union is vested in the President
under Art.53(1) and shall be exercised by him either
directly or through officers subordinate to him in
accordance with the Constitution. All executive actions of
the Government of India shall be expressly taken in the name
of the President under Art.77(1). Under cl.(2) thereof,
orders and other instruments made and executed in the name
of the President shall be authenticated as may be specified
in rules to be made by the President i.e. in the manner
specified under the Authentication (Orders and other
Instruments) Rules, 1958 framed under Art. 72(2). In terms
of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules,
1961, all matters relating to the property of the Union,
allotment of Government lands in Delhi, administration of
Government estates under the control of the Ministry of
Works & Housing and the administration of the Land &
Development office, are matters exclusively vested in the
Ministry of Works & Housing vide Entries 1,6 and 23(1) in
the Second Schedule under the head ‘Ministry of Works &
Housing'. In the light of the said directive, as further
confirmed by the constitutionally enacted regulations, the
power over the allotment of nazul lands, administration of
leases in Delhi and the control and administration of Land &
Development office in particular and the property of the
Union in general are subjects vested solely under the
control of the Ministry of Works & Housing. In the premises,
by such transfer of authority, the Chief Commissioner of
Delhi and necessarily his successor, the Lt. Governor,
became bereft of his powers to control and administer the
lease and any attempt by respondent No.2 to set up a claim
that the Lt. Governor is the authority empowered to
administer the lease is wholly frivolous and untenable and
must be rejected. [502 F; 503 A-C; E-G]

6(i)The impugned notices dated March 1, 1980 and March
10, 1980 were not issued bona fide in the ordinary course of
official business for implementation of the law or for
securing justice but were actuated with an ulterior and
extraneous purpose ant thus were wholly mala fide and
politically motivated. [519 C]

6(ii)Fraud on power voids the order if it is not
exercised bona fide for the end design. There is a
distinction
402
between exercise of power in good faith and misuse in bad
faith. The former arises when an authority misuses its power
in breach of law, say, by taking into account bona fide, and
with best of intentions, some extraneous matters or by
ignoring relevant matters. That would render the impugned
act or order ultra vires. It would be a case of fraud on

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

powers. The misuse in bad faith arises when the power is
exercised for an improper motive, say, to satisfy a private
or personal grudge or for wreaking vengeance of a Minister.
A power is exercised maliciously if its repository is
motivated by personal animosity towards those who are
directly affected by its exercise. Use of a power for an
‘“alien' purpose other than the one for which the power is
conferred is mala fide use of that power. Some is the
position when an order is made for a purpose other than that
which finds place in the order. The ulterior or atien
purpose clearly speaks of the misuse of the power. [507 F-H]

6(iii) It is not for the parties to say what is
relevant or not. The matter is one for the Court to decide.
Mala fides on the part of the Government in power or its
functionaries would be sufficient to invalidate the impugned
notices. [505 F]

6(iv) The petitioners have alleged several facts
imputing improper motives which have not been specifically
denied and there is only a_ bare denial with the assertion
that the facts are not relevant. Mere denial of allegations
does not debar the courts from inquiring into the
allegations. It is quite evident that no action was
contemplated against the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. by any
of the respondents prior to February 17, 1980. Respondent
No.2 upon assumption of his office as the Lt. Governor of
Delhi on that day immediately set ona course of action
against the Indian Express which culminated in the issue of
the impugned notices. It cannot be doubted that is
initiative to call for the files from the Municipal
Corporation relating to the construction of the new Express
Building was an action of his own not provoked by anyone,
much less at the instance of respondent No.1, the Union of
India, Ministry of Works & Housing. The sequence of events
set in motion immediately after his assumption of office as
the Lt. Governor demonstrate the extent to which and the
keenness with which he pursued the matter. It would appear
that the entire administrative machinery was geared into
action by respondent no.2 and he ‘activated' the taking of
steps culminating in the issue of the impugned notices. [509
A-B; 515 A-B]

403

6(v) The dominant purpose which actuated respondent
no.2 in initiating governmental action was not so much for
implementation of the provisions of the Master Plan or the
Zonal Development Plans framed under the Delhi Development
Act or the observance of the relevant Municipal Bye-laws
under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, but to use these
provisions for an ‘alien' purpose and in bad faith i.e. for
demolition of the Express Buildings with mark of retribution
or political vendetta for the role of Indian Express during
the period of Emergency and thereafter and thereby to bring
about closure of the Indian Express. [512 D-E]

6(vi) It was Somewhat strange that the Land &

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

19Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Development Officer who was a minor functionary of the
Ministry of Works & Housing should have filed a _ counter
supporting the action of respondent no.2. There is no doubt
that the Land & Development Officer deliberately made an
inaccurate statement that he is not under the administrative
control of the Ministry. [518 B]

6(vii) The contention that there was imminent danger of
demolition of the Express. Building nor was the impugned
notice by the Engineer Officer a notice of re-entry upon
forfeiture of lease, is against the very terms of the
impugned notice. There is a categoric averment that the
grant of sanction by the then Minister for Works & Housing
was illegal, improper and irregular. It is therefore futile
to contend that the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 was
not a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease but merely
a notice of an _ exploratory nature requiring Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the lease should not
be forfeiture under cl.5 of the lease-deed. [518 C-E]

7(i) The construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 for starting a Hindi
Newspaper and the installation of the printing press in double basement was allowed by the Delhi
Development Authority, in accordance with the provisions of the Master Plan. [520 H] 7(ii) The
Press Enclave on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg otherwise known as the Mathura Road Commercial
Complex is not a ‘development area’ within the meaning of s.2(3) of the Delhi Development Act,
1957. The Master Plan does not prescribe any FAR for the press enclave situate on Mathura Road
commercial area nor does such area fall within the ‘already built-up commercial are ‘as defined in
the Master Plan i.e. commercial area falling within the walled city of Old Delhi. Apparently, the
contention that the FAR of no commercial area in Delhi can exceed 400 is wholly misconceived
inasmuch as the Master Plan in express terms permits FAR of the commercial areas in Minto Road
and Ranjit Singh Road at 400. The Zonal Development Plan for the D-II area approved by the
Central Government in November 1966 mentions four commercial areas, namely (1) Asaf Ali Road
commercial area (2) Minto Road commercial area (3) Mathura Road commercial area, and (4)
Circular Road commercial area (opposite Ramlila Ground). Although in the Zonal Development

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 20Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Plan for D-II area, Asaf Ali Road commercial area is described as fully developed with no room for
expansion, the FAR of which is admittedly 400, there could be still a further increase in FAR subject
to payment of premium. This could only be under the provisions of the Zonal Development Plan for
D-II area and therefore it must logically follow that the FAR prescribed in the Zonal Development
Plan for Mathura Road commercial area where the press enclave is situate is 400. The press area is
not far from Asaf Ali Road commercial area. It not only falls in the same D-II area but is treated as
part of a complex of four commercial areas in the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area. This press
area is not even described as fully commercialized. If FAR 400 is prescribed and allowed for asaf Ali
Road commercial area which is fully developed, it could not possibly be impermissible for the press
area which although fully commercialized was still not fully developed. [520 D; 524 C- E; 526 D-G]
7(iii) The floor area ratio or FAR is the restriction on the number of floors in a building with
reference to the plot area. Where FAR is not specified in the Master Plan which admittedly is the
case in regard to press area on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, the only bye-law applicable would be
bye-laws 21 and 22. Bye-law 21(1) restricts the height of a building to 70 feet. This height is to be
measured from the centre of the adjacent portion of the ‘nearest street’. Admittedly as is clear from
the sanction plan, the height of the new Express Building is about 47 feet. The adjacent portion
which is the service road is on level with the plinth of the additional construction. Taking Mathura
Road as the 'nearest street’ the level of Mathura Road stretches from 2 ft. to 5 ft. higher than the
plinth level of the additional construction. In any view of the matter, the additional construction
could therefore be permissible if it did not exceed a height of 63 feet. This is because of bye- law
21(1) and also because of FAR with which is linked the ground floor coverage is not specified in the
Master Plan. In order to avoid congestion the maximum height is further restricted under bye-law
22 in proportion to the width of the abutting street. In the instant case, Mathura Road which is the
abutting street measure in width 150 feet. This is apart from the immediately abutting service road
which, even if reckoned as an abutting street, is 63 feet in width. Therefore, applying bye-law 22(4)
read with bye-law 21(1), it is the service road of the street that governs the height of the buildings in
the press area as well as the number of floors, the minimum floor height being already specified in
bye-law 19. The restriction on the height of buildings is therefore governed by the width of the street
subject to the maximum height of 70 feet and this is the measure adopted where FAR for a
particular area is not specified in the Master Plan. [529 C, E-F; 530 A-C; F-H; 531 A] 7(iv) Bye-law
25(2)(IV-B) only applies to "already built up commercial areas as indicated in the Master Plan such
other areas as may be declared as commercial areas by the appropriate authority from time to time.
The list of already build-up commercial area as defined in the Master Plan admittedly does not
include the press area on the Mathura Road. At the time of construction of buildings in the press
area, there were also no restrictions as to the FAR along the Mathura Road and the only restriction
on construction of such buildings was that the allottees of the plots in the press area should
construct buildings upto a height of 60 ft. [533 E-F] 7(v) It must therefore be held that the
permission granted by Sikander Bakht, the then Minister for Works & Housing for the construction
of the w Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for Installation of
the printing press was not in violation of the Master Plan for Delhi or the Zonal Development Plan
for D-II area or the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Buildings) Bye-laws, 1959 inasmuch as ex facie
by-law 26 read with 25(2)(IV-B) was not applicable to the press area on the Mathura Road.
Admittedly, the Master Plan does not prescribe any FAR for the Press enclave. The Zonal
Development Plan for the first time prescribed FAR for the four commercial areas for general

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 21Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

business and commercial areas. All these commercial areas fall within D-II area for which the Zonal
Development Plan prescribes an FAR of 400. [535 E-F] 8(i) The non-obstante clause in section
53(A)()) of the Delhi Development Act clearly gives an overriding effect to the sanction granted by
the Delhi Development Authority for the construction of the new Express Building with an increased
FAR of 360 and a double basement for Installation of printing press or the working platform. The
effect of grant of such permission by the Authority was to modify the sanctioned plans of the
Municipal Corporation to that . tent. That apart the term development as defined in section 2(t) of
the Act includes . the carrying out of buildings........ in, on, over or under land in any building etc.
and is wide enough to include the structures. in question. As the Authority approved each of these
structures for which the impugned show cause notice under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 had been Issued by the Zonal Engineer (Buildings), City Zone, Municipal
Corporation, it is clear that he had acted beyond his authority and power. [537 A-C] 8(ii) There is no
dispute that all the structures are below the ground. The main purpose of the upper basement i.e. a
working platform measuring 6000 sq.ft. was meant to work the printing press. If the upper
basement or the working platform constructed by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. is demolished,
the Installation of the printing press itself in the lower basement with the sanction of the Delhi
Development Authority under the appropriate statutory provision would be nullified and the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. would not be in a position to operate the printing press at all. Without
the water storage tank the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. would not get the completion certificate
and it is difficult to understand how the underground tunnel passage, to connect the old and new
Express Building would cause traffic hazard. At any rate, such minor deviation would not result in a
demolition of the Express Building. The manner in which the impugned notice was got issued by the
Municipal Corporation at the direction of respondent no.2 shows that it was done with an ulterior
purpose. The illegality of the action is writ large and the manner in which it was done creates a
ground for belief that the action was motivated. [538 C-E] 8(iii) It 18 evident from page 16 of the
Printed Master Plan and the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area at pages 935 and 936 that
semi-basement, meaning a second basement is permissible under the Master-Plan as well as the
Zonal Development Plan. The Bye-laws of the Delhi Municipal Corporation do not prohibit second
basement and on the contrary bye-law 54 use the term ‘basements’. Moreover, double basements
have, in fact, been permitted in the case of many hotels by the Delhi Development Authority. [543
B-D] 8(iv) It is difficult to conceive how the huge printing press with a height of 24 ft. could be
placed on a pedestal or be laid on the floor of the basement in such a manner as to discharge the
newspapers on the ground floor. It is common ground that there is a working platform in all the
other printing presses in the same line of buildings like that of the Times of India, the National
Herald, Patriot and the old Indian Express Building . In all these buildings, the printing presses are
Installed in the lower basement and there is an over-hanging platform in the printing press in each
of the buildings to receive the printed material. Therefore, there is no Justification of the working
platform. If the Municipal Bye-laws do not permit the construction of a double basement then they
would be clearly violative of Art.14, 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. [543 F-H; 544 A] 9(i)
The basic principle of estoppel is that a person who by some statement or representation of fact
causes another to act to his detriment in reliance on the truth of it is not allowed to deny it later,
even though it is wrong. Justice here prevails over truth. Estoppel is often described as a rule of
evidence, but more correctly it is a principle of law. As a principle of common law it applies only to
representation about past or present facts. But there is also an equitable principle of ‘promissory

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 22Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

estoppel’ which can apply to public authorities. [545 E-F] 9(ii) In public law, the most obvious
limitation on the doctrine of estoppel is that lt cannot be evoked 80 as to give an overriding u power
which It does not in law possess. In other words, no sextuple can legitimate action which 18 ultra
vires. Another limitation is that the principle of estoppel does not operate at the level of Government
policy. Estoppels have however been allowed to operate against public authority in minor matters of
formality where no question of ultra vires arises. [548 A-C] In the instant case, the then Minister for
Works & Housing acted within the scope of his authority in granting permission of the lessor i.e. the
Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to construct new
Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for inst installation of a
printing press for publication of a Hindi newspaper under the Rules of Business framed by the
President under Art.77(3). Therefore, the doctrine of ultra vires does not come into operation. In
view of this, respondent no.1 the Union of India is precluded by the doctrine of promissory estoppel
from questioning the authority of the Minister in granting such permission. In that view, the
successor Government was clearly bound by the decision taken by the Minister particularly when it
had been acted upon- [548 D-F] Robertson v. Minister of Pensions L.R. [1949] I K.B. 227, Union of

forum for adjudication of its claim. It is also directed that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi shall

1(i) The material available is sufficient to hold that the impugned notices suffer from arbitrariness
and non- application of mind. They are violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Hence they are
liable to be quashed. It is not necessary therefore to express any opinion on the contentions based
on Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. [556 F] 1(ii) The said notices were issued by the authorities
concerned under the Pressure of the second respondent. The question whether the notices should be
issued or not does not appear to have been considered independently by the concerned
administrative authorities before issuing them. [555 F] 1(iii) The Lt. Governor failed to make a
distinction between the power with respect to the subject 'Property of the Union and the revenue
therefrom’ which is in Entry 32 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the general
powers of administration entrusted to him under Article 239 of the Constitution as the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 23Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi. The property in question is a part of the estate of the
Central Government. Mere nearness to the seat of the Central Government does not clothe the Lt.
Governor of Delhi with any power~ in respect of the property of the Central Government. He can
discharge only those powers which are entrusted to him by the Constitution and the laws. Moreover,
all the powers of the former Chief Commissioner of Delhi have not devolved on the Lt. Governor and
continue to vest in him. [556 B-D] 2(i) The question arising out of the lease, such as, whether there
has been breach of the covenants under the lease, whether the lease can be forfeited, whether relief
against forfeiture can be granted etc. are foreign to the scope of Article 32 of the Constitution. They
cannot be decided just on affidavits. These are matters which should be tried in a regular civil
proceeding. One should remember that the property belongs to the Union of India and the rights in
its cannot be bartered away in accordance with the sweet will of an officer or a Minister or a Lt.
Governor but they should be dealt with in accordance with law. At the same time a person who has
acquired rights in such property cannot also be deprived of them except in accordance with law. The
stakes in this case are very high for both the parties and neither of them can take law into his own
hands. [1556 H; 557 A-B] 2(ii) No opinion is expressed on the rights of the parties under the lease
and all other questions argued in this case. They are left open to be decided in an appropriate
proceeding. It is however, open to both the parties if they are so advised to take such fresh action as
may be open to them in law on the basis of all the relevant facts including those which existed before
the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 was issued by the Engineer Officer of the Land and
Development Office to vindicate their respective rights in accordance with law. This order is made
without prejudice to the rights of the Union Government to compound the breaches, if any,
committed by the lessee and to regularise the lease by receiving adequate premium therefor from
the 1. see, if lt 18 permissible to do 80. [557 C-E] 2(iii) It 18 open to the Delhi Municipal Corporation
to examine the matter afresh. independently and to take such action that may be open to it in
accordance with law. The Delhi Municipal Corporation may, if so advised instead of taking any
further action against the petitioners permit the petitioners to compound the breaches, if any,
committed by them in accordance with law. [557 E-F] Per Misra. J.

1(i) The impugned notices threatening re-entry and demolition of the construction are invalid and
have no legal value and must be quashed for reasons detailed in the two judgments. [557 H] 1(ii) The
other questions involved in the case are based upon contractual obligations between the parties.
These questions can be satisfactorily and effectively dealt with in a properly instituted proceeding or
suit and not by a writ petition on the basis of affidavits which are so discrepant and contradictory.
[558 A-B]

2. The right to the land and to construct buildings thereon for running a business si not derived
from Article 19(1)(a) or 19(1)(g) of the Constitution but springs from the terms of contract between
the parties regulated by other laws governing the subject, viz., the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the
Master Plan, the Zonal Development Plan framed under the Delhi municipal Bye-laws, 1959
irrespective of the purpose for which the buildings are constructed. Whether there has been a breach
of the contract of lease or whether there has been a breach of the other statutes regulating the
constriction of buildings are the questions which can be properly decided by taking detailed
evidence involving examination and cross-examination of witnesses. [558 B-D] & ORIGINAL

The following Judgments were delivered by : SEN, J. These petitions under Art. 32 of the
constitution are by petitioner no.1, the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd., which is a company
incorporated under the companies Act, 1956 engaged in the business of printing and publishing the
national newspaper the Indian Express (Delhi Edition) from the Express Buildings at 9-10,
Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi, held on a perpetual lease from the Union of India under a
registered indenture of lease dated March 17, 1958. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner
no.2, the Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd. Of which petitioner no.3 Ram Nath
Goenka is the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Petitioner no.4 Nihal Singh was the then
Editor-in-chief of the Indian Express and petitioner no.5 Romesh Thapar was the Editor of the
Seminar published from the Express Buildings.

Respondent no.1 is the Union of India, no.2 is Jagmohan, Lt. Governor of Delhi, no.3 the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi, no.4 the Zonal Engineer (Buildings), no.5 the Land & Development Officer,
etc. The petitioners challenge the constitutional validity of a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of
lease issued by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office, New Delhi dated March 10, 1980
purporting to be on behalf of the lessor i.e.. the Government of India, Ministry of Works & Housing,
New Delhi. The said notice required petitioner no.1, the Express Newspapers Pvt ., New Delhi to
show cause why the Union of India should not re-enter upon and take possession of the demised
premises i.e. plots nos. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg together with the Express Buildings built
thereon under cl.5 of the aforesaid indenture of lease dated March 17, 1958 for the alleged breach of
cls. 2(14 and 2(5) of the lease-deed. They also challenge the validity of an earlier notice dated March
1, 1980 issued by the Zonal Engineer (Buildings), Municipal Corporation, City Zone, Delhi to
petitioner no.1, the Express Newspapers Pvt.Ltd., New Delhi to show cause why the aforesaid
buildings being unauthorized should not be demolished under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.

The petitioners allege that the impugned notices of re- entry upon forfeiture of lease and of
threatened demolition of the Express Buildings at Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi which
constitute the nerve center of the newspaper the Indian Express which has the largest combined
circulation among all the daily newspapers in India and is published simultaneously from eleven
cities in the country, are wholly mala fide and politically motivated. They further allege that the
impugned notices constitute an act of personal vendetta against the Express Group of Newspapers

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 25Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

in general, and Ram Nath Goenka, chairman of the Board of Directors in particular, and are
violative of Arts. 14, 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. We are informed that a teleprinter is
installed at the Express Buildings at Bahadurshah Zafar Marg from where the Delhi edition of the
Indian Express is published and the editorials, editorial policies and leading articles are transmitted
to ten cities all over India from where the other editorials of the Indian Express are published
simultaneously every day, namely, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bombay, Chandigarh, Cochin,
Hyderabad, Madras, Madurai, Vijayawada and Vizianagaram.

The issues raised in this case are far-reaching in significance to the maintenance of our federal
structure of Government. It necessarily involves a claim by the Lt. Governor of Delhi that he has the
power and authority to administer properties of the Union of India within the Union Territory of
Delhi which he is called upon to administer. The questions presented are whether the Lt. Governor
of Delhi could usurp the functions of the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing and direct an
investigation into the affairs of the Union of India i.e. question the legality and propriety of the
action of the then Minister for Works & Housing in the previous Government at the Centre in
granting permission to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to construct the new Express Building with
an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for installation of a printing press for publication
of a Hindi Newspaper on the western portion of the demised premises i.e. plots nos. 9 and 10,
Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi with the Express Buildings built thereon.

The Lt. Governor asserts that he has the power and authority to administer the properties the Union
of India in the Union Territory of Delhi. The further question is whether the grant of sanction by the
then Minister for Works & Housing and the consequential sanction of building plans by him of the
new Express Building was contrary to the Master Plan and the Zonal Development Plans framed
under the Delhi Development Act, 1957 and the municipal bye-laws, 1959 made under the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 and therefore the lessor i.e. the Union of India had the power to
issue a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease under cl.5 of the indenture of lease dated March 17,
1958 and take possession of the demised premises together with the Express Buildings built thereon
and the Municipal Corporation had the authority to direct demolition of the said buildings as
unauthorized construction under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. The
ultimate question is whether the threatened action which the petitioners characterise as arbitrary,
illegal and irrational was violative of Art. 19(1)(a) read with Art. 14 of the Constitution.

History of the matter :

FACTS OF THE CASE The facts are somewhat involved and present a feature which is rather
disturbing. It would be convenient to set forth the facts relating to the impugned notices
Put very briefly, the essential facts are these. On February 17, 1980, respondent no.2 Jagmohan
assumed office as the Lt. Governor of Delhi. That very evening which was a Sunday, he summoned
the Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and called for the files relating to the
construction of the new Express Building at Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi. On the next day
i.e. On the 18th morning, the files relating to the grant of sanction for the construction of the same
were made available to him. On February 20, 1980, some important files of the Delhi Development

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 26Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Authority relating to the Express Buildings were sent to respondent no .2. On February 29, 1980,
respondent no.2 through the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Delhi caused the locks of the
office and cupboards of the Zonal Engineer (Building) to be broken open to take away the files
relating to the new Express Building. Immediately thereafter i.e. On March 1, 1980 respondent no.2
convened a press conference in which he handed over a press release alleging that the new Express
Building put up by the petitioners was in contravention of law in several respects. The press release
stated inter alia that :

1. The government had been receiving complaints that additional space was
sanctioned to the Indian Express Buildings in total disregard of the provisions of the
Master Plan, zonal regulations and Municipal Corporation bye-laws.

2. The Lt. Governor had ordered an inquiry into the grant of sanction of the building
plans in January 1979 by the Municipal Corporation for the construction of the new
Express Building and had entrusted the inquiry to a Building and had entrusted the
inquiry to a committee of three of his subordinate officials.

3. The committee had been asked to submit its report within three days and the
authorities of the DDA and the MCD had been separately directed to extend all
co-operation to the committee and made available all relevant files and connected
papers.

4. The Commissioner of the MCD had been separately adviced to take immediate
action in regard to the unauthorized deviations made from the sanctioned plan in the
construction of the new Express Building.

The Lt. Governor also held out a threat at the press conference that the new Express Building might
have to be demolished. The holding of the press conference was broadcast over the All India Radio
within an hour and within two hours the Delhi Doordarshan telecast the same and read out the
contents of the press release. It also exhibited the film both of the press conference as well as of the
new Express Building.

On the same day i.e. On March 1, 1980, although the relevant files had been removed from his office,
the Zonal Engineer (buildings), City Zone, Municipal Corporation served a notice on petitioner no.1
the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why action should not be taken for demolition of
the Express Buildings under 88. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. It reads
as under :

Number 79/B/ua/cz/80XXIII Dated 1.3.1980.

You are hereby informed that on your property situated at Bahadurshah Zafar Marg
bearing numbers 9 & 10, you have started unauthorized construction of excess
basement beyond sanction and construction of upper basement without sanction as

shown red in the sketch below.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 27Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Therefore, I, L.S. Pal, Zonal Engineer (Building) as authorized by the Commissioner
under D.M.C. Act, 1957 vide 8. 49 to serve upon you notice and call upon you to
appear in my office within three days of the receipt of this notice during office hours
with all relevant records and documents relating to the above construction to explain
as to why under sub I of clause 343 as to issuing for demolition of unauthorized
construction should not be issued. Please further note under sub-clause I of clause
344 you are ordered to stop construction work on this land failing which under
sub-clauses 2 and 3 action will be taken against you and the construction will be
demolished at your risk and cost.

Corporation, Delhi.

Served on M/s. Indian Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. 9/10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg,
Delhi.

Three days after i.e. On March 4, 1980, a second press release was issued from the Raj Nivas, the
official residence of respondent no.2. It was sent by a special courier to all newspaper offices to
justify the action of respondent no.2 in initiating an inquiry and the mode that had been prescribed
for holding the inquiry. It stated :

In regard to the unauthorized deviations from the sanctioned plan and construction
of about 23,000 sq.ft. in the lower basement and upper basement, the spokesman
indicated that the show cause notice had been issued by the Corporation authorities.
Further action would be taken in the light of the reply received by the party
concerned.

Again, the issue of the show cause notice figured in the third press release dated March 8, 1980
wherein under the heading Additional Construction in the Indian Express Buildings the above
extract was repeated verbatim. Respondent no.2 in his counter had asserted that the show cause
notice was issued by the Commissioner in accordance with his STATUTORY functions after
verification of the allegations. However, it is asserted that respondent no.2 being responsible for
administration of the Union Territory of Delhi was obliged to ask all the authorities concerned to
prevent violation of lease by any person or institution. Whereas the files of the Corporation were
summoned by respondent no.2 before the press conference on March 1, 1980, the files of the
Ministry of Works & Housing were summoned by him in the first week of March 1980. It is admitted
by the Ministry of Works & Housing that the said files were made available to respondent no.2 on
March 7, 1980. On March 7, 1980, the Land & Development Officer acting as part of the overall plan
of respondent no.2 issued a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of the lease signed by the Engineer
Officer in the Land & Development Officer under the Ministry of Works & Housing purporting to act
for and on behalf of the President of India under clause XIX of the agreement of lease alleging that
there were breaches in contravention of cl. (11) of the agreement for lease dated May 26, 1954. This
notice was later withdrawn because it was realized that forfeiture of the lease had to be with
reference to the registered indenture of lease dated March 17, 1958 and not under cl. XIX of the

agreement for lease of 1954. On March 10,1980, the Engineer Officer in the Land & Development
Office issued a notice in supersession of the said notice dated March 7, 1980 in these terms :

Sub: Premises situated at plot nos. 9 & 10 Delhi Mathura Road, New Delhi.

Dear Sir, I am to inform you that you have started the construction of additional block on the land to
be kept open without taking the permission from the lessor under the terms of lease nor the plans
were submitted by you for the sanction under the terms of lease by the lessor for the construction of
multistoreyed building over open plot which is in contravention of clause 2(14) and 2(5) of the leasedeed.

You are, therefore, hereby requested to show cause within 30 days from the date of receipt of this
letter to why the property should not be re-entered under clause 5 of the perpetual lease.

Please take notice that if satisfactory cause is shown within the stipulated period as referred to
above, action to re-enter upon the premises will be taken against you without any further reference
to YOU.

This is in supersession of this office letter of even no. dated 7.3.1980.
Yours faithfully, Sd/-(R.S. Sibal) Engineer Officer For & on behalf of the President of India.
Tele: 388727.

On March 12, 1980 at a specially convened press conference respondent no.2 released the report of
the committee of his subordinates. The committee in its report substantiated the allegations which
respondent no.2 had aired at his press conference on March 1, 1980 and through the press release
dated March 4, 1980 and among other findings recorded that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. was
liable to pay Rs.35 lakhs as conversion charges. From the report it appears that the Land
Development Officer had been functioning in close coordination with respondent no.2 as is evident
from the following extract from the report of the Three-Member Committee:

"The representative of Land & Development Officer who was present at the site was
directed by the Committee to take measurement of the new constructions. But the A
measurement could not be completed before the Committee left the site. Therefore.
the representative of Land & Development Officer was asked to complete the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 29Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

measurement by 10.3.1980.

It is clear that there had been no application of mind by the Engineer Officer in issuing the show
cause notice.

The recital of these events clearly shows that respondent no.2 displayed great zeal in causing a probe
into the manner in which sanction was granted by the then Minister for Works & Housing for the
construction of the new Express building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for
installation of a printing press and the entire administration was geared into action with lightning
speed 80 as to ensure that some action or other was taken against the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
This is evident from the fact, for instance, that he gave the Three- Member Committee only three
days to examine questions which, if they were properly scrutinized, would require inspection of the
records from the year 1949 onwards of at least six agencies viz. Ministry of Works & Housing, Land
& Development Office in the Ministry of Works & Housing, New Delhi Municipal Committee,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi Water supply and Sewage Disposal Undertaking and the
Union of India. He not only constituted a committee of subordinates to go into the affairs of the
Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing but also procured the files of the Central Government.
The Ministry of Works & Housing apparently made available to the said Committee all the relevant
files of the Government pertaining to the new Express Building. There was no confidentiality
maintained. Without the express authorization of the Government of India, respondent no.2
published the minutes of the proceedings of the Government. After the submission of the report by
the Three-Member Committee, he on March 14, 1980 addressed a letter to the then Minister for
Works & Housing to the effect :

CONFIDENTIAL D.O.No.60/LG/80 March 14, 1980.

Dear Shri P.C. Sethi, I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of the Enquiry Report in respect of
the Indian Express Building. Some action may necessary at the Ministry's end.

I am seeking legal opinion to ascertain as to what action can be taken at this stage to salvage the
situation created by irregularities and illegalities committed in this case. I will write to you further in
the matter.

With kind regards, Yours sincerely, Sd/- (Jagmohan) Shri P.C. Sethi, Minister for Works & housing,
Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi.

Encl: Enquiry Report From the tenor of the letter is difficult to imagine that the Lt. L Governor
could address such a letter to a Union Minister. On the same day, the Lt. Governor also addressed to
a letter on similar terms to the Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority and the
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

Execution of agreement for lease dated May 26, 1954: Allotment of plots nos. 9 & 10, Bahadurshah
Zafar Marg to Express Newspapers Pvt.Ltd. By an indenture styled as an ‘agreement for lease’

executed on May 26, 1954 between the late Feroze Gandhi, Managing Director, Express Newspapers

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 30Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Pvt. Ltd. Of the one part and the Secretary (Local Self Government to the Chief Commissioner of
Delhi 'by the orders and directions of the President of India' of the other part, the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. were allotted plots nos. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg in terms of the
intended lease entered into between the parties on November 17, 1952, pursuant to the allotment of
the said plots to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. for construction of a four-storeyed building
meant to be used for a newspaper, installation of a printing press therefore on the ground floor with
residential accommodation for the staff on the top. Incidentally, the Central Government had in the
year 1949 demarcated the press area along the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg consisting of 10 plots nos. 1
to 10 known as the Press Enclave as a commercial complex for allotment to the press viz. to various
newspapers like the Indian Express, h Times of India, Patriot, National Herald etc. These other
newspapers like the Times of India, Patriot, National Herald were also granted similar plots on the
same conditions and were allowed to build on the entire area of their respective plots without any
restrictions whatsoever. The petitioners case is that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. was first
allotted plots no.1 and 2 but later at the request of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of
India, it accepted instead plots nos. 9 and 10 as the Government required plots nos. 1 and 2 for
construction of the Gandhi Memorial Hall known as the Pearey Lal Bhawan.

Preliminary work of construction of the Express Buildings : Discovery of underground sewer line:
Execution of fresh lease agreement dated November 19,1957.

While the preliminary work of construction was started by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. On the
basis of the aforesaid agreement, an underground sewer line was found be running diagonally across
plots nos. 9 and 10. Thereupon, the parties entered into negotiations for modification of the said
agreement. It was agreed between the parties that in view of the underground drain running
through the plots, the Express Buildings would be constructed only to the of the drain and in such a
way as to leave the drainage system unaffected i.e. till the drain was diverted. The Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. was thus disabled from building on a substantial part of the land allotted to it
until the underground drain was realigned outside the boundary of the two plots. In effect, an area
of 2740 square yards to the west of the drain had to be left open as residual plot of the land out of
the total area of 5703 square yards. The agreement was embodied in a document styled as a lease
agreement executed between the parties on November 19, 1957 80 as to protect the underground
sewage drain and restrict the construction of the building to the east of the drain.

On April 11, 1956, J.N. Ambegaokar, Under Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Works
& Housing addressed a letter to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to the following effect:

"I am directed to state that the allotment of land to the Indian Express Newspapers
on the Delhi Mathura Road, New Delhi, has been revised on the following d basis: (i)
2965 sq. yards to the east of pipe line @ Rs. 1,25,000 per acre plus 2-1/2% annual
ground rent thereon; (ii) 2740 sq. yards to the west of the pipe line @ Rs. 36,000 per
acre plus 2-1/2% per acre annual ground rent thereon. In addition to the premium as
indicated above, the following amount should also be recovered : (a) 50% of the
ground rent of Rs. 2424 (@ 2-1/2% of the total premium of Rs.96,955) per annum for
the period from 17.11.1952 the date of original allotment to 14.1.1956 - Rs. 3838, (b)

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 31Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

an advance ground rent for 1-1/2 years @ Rs. 2424 per annum - Rs. 3636."
The revised allotment was subject, among others, to the following conditions :

The area of the west of the pipe line as mentioned in para 1(ii) of this letter should be
maintained as an open space i.e. as lawns, paths or parking ground. The lessor shall
have the right to construct and maintain another sewer line along this land, if
necessary."

The letter went on to say that necessary instructions had been issued to the Chief Commissioner of
Delhi in that behalf with a request that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. should get in touch with
the Land & Development Office, New Delhi for taking k possession of the land. It would appear from
the letter that the Ministry of Works & Housing permitted the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to
construct on plots nos. 9 and 10 to the east of the sewer line with a corresponding reduction in the
amount of premium and ground rent for the area west of the sewer line as compared to the amount
chargeable to the area east of the sewer line. Execution of the indenture of lease dated March 17,
1958 and the terms thereof.

By a registered indenture of lease dated March 17, 1958 executed between the President of India of
the one part and the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. Of the other part, the Chief Commissioner of
Delhi 'under the instruction of the Government of India relating to the disposal of building sites in
the new Capital of India’ demised on behalf of the Union of India in perpetuity the nazul land
described therein in consideration of payment of a premium of Rs. 96,955 admeasuring 1.179 acres
of thereabout being plots nos. 9, 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg on payment of the yearly rent Rs.1212
stipulated therein for the h period November 17, 1952 to January 14, 1956 and thereafter @ Rs.2424
per annum. The lease-deed inter alia provided as per cl.2(4) that the lessee shall keep to the
satisfaction of the Chief Commissioner the area to the west of the sewer line running diagonally on
plots nos. 9 and 10 from north- west to south-west admeasuring 2740 sq. yards as green i.e. as open
space on which on building activity was permitted. The petitioner were charge premium at two
different rates of the leasehold premises. The premium charged was at Rs.36,000 per acre for the
area west to the sewer line and for the remaining portion, i.e. to the east of the sewer line on which
construction of the building was permitted, the price of the land was fixed at Rs.1,25,000 per acre. It
may be mentioned that the above perpetual lease was executed by Assistant Secretary (Local Self
Government) to the Chief Commissioner, Delhi by the order and direction of the President of India.
Likewise, the earlier agreement dated November 19, 1957, 80 also the supplementary agreement of
May 26, 1954 to which we shall presently refer, were executed by the said officer in the same
manner. Both the agreements stipulated (under clause V of both) that the rules, REGULATIONS
and bye-laws of the Municipal corporation of Delhi relating to buildings which may be in force from
time to time shall be conformed by the lessee.

On November 17, 1964, a supplemental lease was executed between the President of India and the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. allowing the permanent change of user in respect of one lac square
feet of the total accommodation of one and a half lac square feet i.e. two-third of the total
accommodation in the Express Buildings for general office use, commercial or otherwise, i.e.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 32Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

allowing the petitioners to sub-let upto 2/3rd of the floor area of the Express Buildings in lieu of
payment of a sum of Rs 2,23,875 by them to the Union of India, the lessor, as an additional
premium and in consideration of their covenant to pay additional ground rent of Rs.5,746.88p. per
annum for the land demised over and above the rent reserved by the perpetual lease. The recital in
the deed was to the effect :

The lessor doth hereby permit the lessee to use 1,00,000 (one lac) sq.feet out of the
total accommodation of 1,50,000 (one ant a half lac) sq.ft. in the said Express
Newspaper Building for general office use commercial or otherwise, excluding
commercial ventures like hotel, cinema, restaurant etc. and subject to the other
provisions and conditions mentioned in clause 7 of the said lease.

Provided further that the lessee shall all along continue to use at least 50,000 (fifty
thousand) sq.feet of the accommodation in the said Express Newspaper Building for
the use of press/presses, office/offices of its newspaper, publications and other
ventures.

And that :

And this indenture further witnesseth that in consideration of the premises, the
lessee doth hereby covenant to the that the lessee will pay an additional ground rent
of Rs. 5746.88p. per annum as and from the 15th day of January 1960 over and above
the ground rent reserved under the said principal lease to be paid by equal half-yearly
payments from the 15th day of July each year as provided in the said principal
lease-deed.

The effect was that the lessor i.e. the Union of India, M of Works & Housing permitted permanent
change of user of the existing Express Building by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. in respect of
1,00,000 sq.ft. Of total accommodation- and it was permitted to let out 75,000 sq.ft. Of the surplus
accommodation with them to the State Trading Corporation for a period of 3 years from February 1,
1960 @ Rs.60 per month per 100 sq.ft. with liberty to the State Trading Corporation to sublet any
part of the area over and above its own needs.

At the time of construction of buildings in the press area, there were no restrictions as to the FAR
permissible along with Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, also known as the Mathura Road Commercial
Complex, and the only restriction on construction of buildings in that area was that the allotters of
the plots in the press area should construct buildings upto a height of 60 feet. Under the agreement
of lease dated May 26, 1954, the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. was allowed to build upon the entire
area of the plots in question being plots nos. 9 and 10 with a ground coverage of 100% i.e.
edge-to-edge, a structure with a minimum of five storeys including the ground floor for the purpose
of installation of a printing press for publication of a Hindi newspaper. This permission was granted
in response to the plans submitted by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. and approved in writing by
the Chief Commissioner of Delhi acting for and on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of India. Such
plans as approved permitted construction by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. Of a building on the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 33Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

entire area of plots nos. 9 and 10 with 100% ground coverage in conformity with the said agreement.
Pursuant thereto, the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. constructed the old Express Building to the east
of the sewer line with an FAR of 260 with reference to the entire plot leased to it i.e. plots nos. 9 and
10 although the building occupied only half of the area. After completion of the old Express Building
to the east of the sewer line on March 14, 1958, the perpetual lease was executed on March 17, 1958,
as already stated. The aforesaid supplemental lease was also executed on November 1, 1964
permitting change of user i.e. enabling the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to sublet two-third of the
accommodation available with it.

At no stage did the Central Government go back upon their solemn commitment embodied in the
agreement of lease dated May 26, 1954 under which the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. was entitled
to construct a four storeyed Express Building on the entire area of plots nos. 9 and 10. They
continued to recognize the right of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to revert to the terms and
conditions thereof as soon as the obstacle to further construction thereto that had been discovered,
unknown to the parties that there was an underground sewage drain running through plots nos. 9
and 10 diagonally, was removed. In particular, they continued to recognize the right of the
petitioners to build on the land kept as open space to the west of the sewer line, once the drain was
diverted. This would be evident from the two facts :

1. The Union of India being the lessor left with the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. the
area to the west of the drain on a reduced premium because it had to be kept as an
open space for protection of the drain. And

2. While nazul plots that are to be left open are valued at Rs. 4840 per acre and
ground rent is assessed accordingly, the area to the west of the drain was assessed at
Rs. 36,000 per acre implying thereby that it was not an area to be kept vacant in

perpetuity.

Constitutional Instruments relating to property of the Union in the Union Territory
of Delhi.

On November 3, 1958 the President of India in exercise of his powers conferred by cl.2 of Art of the
Constitution issued the Authentication (Orders and Other Instruments) Rules, 1958 relating to, and
dealing with, the conduct of business of the Government of India. In terms of the said Rules all
Secretaries of the Ministries concerned were authorized to authenticate documents on bahalf of the
government of India. On November 6, 1959 all functions relating to administration of leases of
Government lands in Delhi were transferred from the Chief Commissioner of Delhi (Local Self
Government) to the Ministry of Works & Housing On January 18, 1961 the President in exercise of
the powers under Art. 77(3) of the Constitution made the Government of India (Allocation of
business Rules, 1961. Rule 2 provided that the business of the Government of India shall be
transacted in the Ministries, Departments, Secretaries and Offices specified in the First Schedule to
the Rules. Rule 3 laid down that the distribution of subjects among the departments shall be as
specified in the Second Schedule. Rule 4 enjoined that the President may on the advice of the Prime
Minister allocate the business of the Government of India among Ministers by assigning one or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 34Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

more departments to the charge of a Minister. The Ministry of Works, Housing and Supply is
specified in the First Schedule at serial no.19. Under the Second Schedule, the distribution of
subjects in the Ministry of Works, Housing and Supply is allocated. Entries 1, 6 and 23 (a) and (1)
come under the Ministry of Works, Housing and Supply and read as under :

1. Property of the Union (not being railway, naval, military or air force works or being the property
of the Department of Atomic Energy) except (i) buildings, the construction of which has been
financed otherwise than from the civil works budget and (ii) buildings, the control of which has at
the time of construction or subsequently, been permanently made over by the Ministry of Works,
Housing and Supply to another Ministry
6.Allotment of Government lands in Delhi.

23.Administration of the Ministry and attached and subordinate organizations,
namely :

(a) Central Public Works Department; ** ** ** ** ** (1) Land & Development Office.

In terms of the aforesaid Entries 1, 6 and 23 (a) and (1), all matters relating to the properties of the
Union including allocation of Government lands in Delhi and the administration of the Land &
Development Office were exclusively vested in the Ministry of Works, Housing and Supply, later the
Ministry of Works & Housing Under Art. 299(1) of the constitution, the President issued a
notification No. GSR 585 dated February 1, 1966 supersession of the earlier notification no. 1161
dated December 1, 1958. The Land & Development Officer under Entry XXI, Item 7 was authorized
to execute contracts assurance of property relating to matters falling within the jurisdiction of the
Land & Development Office. The relevant Entry reads :

7. In the case of Land & Development Office :

(i) All contracts and assurances of property relating to matters falling within the
jurisdiction of Land & Development Officer;

(ii) all contracts, deeds and other instruments relating to or for the purpose of
enforcement of the terms and conditions of the sale/lease-deeds of the Government
Built Property in Delhi/New Delhi;

(iii) auctioneering agreements, bonds of auctioneers and security bonds for the due
performance of works by the auctioneers
However, by an overriding provisions contained in Entry XII, it was laid down that ‘notwithstanding
the previous authorizations, any contract or assurance of property relating to any matter whatsoever
may be executed by the Secretary, Special Secretary, Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary or Deputy
Secretary to the Central Government in the appropriate Ministry or Department’. In terms of the
allocation of Business Rules of the Government of India, the Ministry of Works & Housing was the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 35Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

appropriate authority for dealing with matters relating to lease of Government lands and in terms of
the aforesaid notification no. GSR 585 issued under Art.299(1), the Secretary, Additional Secretary,
Joint Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary in the Ministry of Works & Housing were
authorized to execute such contracts in the name of the President of India. It cannot therefore be
doubted that the Ministry of Works & Housing with the Minister at the head was and is the ultimate
authority responsible for the following items of work, viz. Property of the Union, Town & Country
Plaining, Delhi Development Authority, Master Plan of Delhi, Administration of Delhi Development
Act, 1957, the Land & Development Office dealing with administration of nazul lands in the Union
Territory of Delhi.

The Ministry of Works & Housing was and also is the ultimate authority in respect of the powers,
functions and duties of the Delhi Development Authority as well as the Municipal corporation of
Delhi, including that of the Delhi Water Supply and Sewage Disposal Committee of the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi.

Statutory changes subsequently brought about in Delhi. It is common ground that the Delhi
Development Act, 1957 is the paramount law on the subject viz. implementation of the Master Plan,
Zonal Development n an and Building Regulations, and overrides the Delhi Municipal Corporation
Act, 1957. The Delhi Development Act came into force on December 30, 1957. The provisions of the
Delhi Municipal Corporation Act were brought into force on different dates. S.2 which is the
definition clause, Chapter II relating the constitution of the Corporation and some other provisions
were brought into force w.e.f. January 2, 1958, 8. 512 on February 15, 1958 and the remaining
provisions including Chapter XIV relating to building regulations were brought into force on April 7,
1958. On September 10, 1962 the Central Government approved the Master Plan for Delhi, prepared
by the Delhi Development Authority under s.7 of the Delhi Development Act. The Master Plan
makes specific regulations for commercial areas and especially for already built-up commercial
areas i.e. walled city of Old Delhi. But the press area on the Mathura Road Commercial Complex
although specified as a commercial area is not listed in the list of already built-up commercial areas
which relate to the walled city of Old Delhi. On November 26, 1956 the Central Government
approved the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area prepared by the Delhi Development Authority
under 8.8 of the Act within which the press plots are located. It provided for an FAR of 400 for the
press area in the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg.

The material on record discloses that the construction of the new Express Building with an incresed
FAR of 360 with a double basement was in conformity with cls. 2(5) and 2(14) of the perpetual
lease-deed dated March 17, 1958 inasmuch as it was with the express sanction of the lessor i.e. the
Union of India. It is also quite clear that Sikander Bakht, the then Minister for Works & Housing
was throughout guided by the officials of the Ministry particularly the Secretary, Ministry of Works
& Housing, who was the competent authority to act for the President with regard to any contract,
grant or assurance of property of the Union relating to any manner whatsoever in relation thereto by
virtue of the notification issued by the President under Art. 299(1) and further that the grant of such
permission was after the matter had been dealt with at all levels an-d was in conformity with the
orders of the then Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority dated October 21, 1978 as one
under ‘special appeal’.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 36Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

After the formation of the Janata Government at the Centre on March 22, 1977 the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. moved for the removal of the legal impediment for the construction of the
Express Building to the west of the sewer line first by moving the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for
shifting of the sewer line outside plots nos. 9 and 10 and secondly, by moving the lessor i.e. the
Union of India, Ministry of Works & housing for grant of requisite sanction to construct the new
Express Building with an FAR of 400. On October 7, 1977 it wrote a letter to the Chief Engineer,
Delhi Water Supply & Sewage Disposal Undertaking, Municipal Corporation of Delhi to inquire
whether it was possible to realign the underground sewer line 80 that it would run outside their
premises and were duly informed that the sewer line could be 80 shifted. Accordingly on October
25, 1977 the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. addressed a letter to the Secretary, Ministry of Works &
Housing saying that additional construction on the western portion of plots nos. 9 and 10 leased out
was possible after the sewer line shifted and that they were in need of a larger amount of because
they wanted to start a Hindi newspaper and were also in need of an additional basement where the
printing press would be located. It was pointed out that because of the underground sewer line
running across these plots, no construction could be undertaken above the sewer line as they had to
leave a safety distance of 25ft. parallel to the same and thus the built-up area available to them was
almost reduced to half i.e. 2963 sq. yards while other presses in the area like the Times of India,
National Herald, Patriot etc. were able to build over the entire extent of their respective plots. It
accordingly requested the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing for permission
to construct on the open space admeasuring 2740 sq.yards on the western side of plots nos 8. 9 and
10 indicating the permissible built-up area as also the terms on which the additional space could be
80 utilized. A copy of the letter was marked to the Land & Development Office, Ministry of Works
Housing. On November 3, 1977 the Secretary instructed the Joint Secretary to call a representative
of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. and the Land & Development Officer and evolve a solution. The
Joint Secretary (Delhi Division) directed the Under Secretary (Land Division) to do the needful.
Incidentally, the Ministry has two separate divisions, the Delhi Division and the Land Division, both
working under the control of the Joint Secretary (Delhi Division). Delhi Division deals with matters
pertaining to the Delhi Development Authority and Urban Development while the Land Division
deals with matters relating to allotment of government lands and administration of lease. It follows
that the Delhi Division was competent to deal with matters relating to construction of the new
Express Building including the permissible FAR and the grant of permission to the lessor under the
lease and the question of payment of additional premium etc. had to be dealt with by the Delhi
Division.

Accordingly, on November 14, 1977, R.K. Mishra, General Manager and authorized representative of
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. waited on the Under Secretary, (Land Division), Ministry of Works &
Housing and was verbally informed that the requisite permission of the lessor could be sought after
the building plans were approved by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and it was then that they
should seek the approval of the lessor and at that time the Ministry would intimate what additional
premium, if any, was payable. The Under Secretary also recorded a note to that effect. Thereafter on
December 7, 1977 petitioner no.3 Ram Nath Goenka addressed a letter to Sikandar Bakht, the then
Minister for Works & Housing drawing his attention to the aforesaid meeting where the
representative of Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. had been intimated that they should first submit
their building plans to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and thereafter seek permission of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 37Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

lessor which would advise them of the amount of premium payable for the change of user. He
requested the Minister to issue necessary instructions directing that the plots in the press area
should be treated as commercial complex which entitled the plot-holders to build over the entire
area of the respective plots subject to the restriction of a height of 60 ft. as stipulated in 1951 without
any restriction as to the area of various floors. There followed a meeting in the Ministry of Works &
Housing on December 20, 1977 when the General Manager of Indian Express and an official of the
Delhi Development Authority were present and the extent of FAR permissible was specifically
discussed. This was followed by a letter of the General Manager dated December 23, 1977 to the
Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing in which he referred to the meeting where it was felt that
although the press area was not expressly mentioned in the Master Plan, it would still fall under the
general description of 'other commercial areas' where only an PAR of 300 was permissible and that
it would be 80 despite the fact that no such limitation existed when the press complex was
established. He referred to the letter of Ram Nath Goenka dated December 7, 1977 to the Minister
wherein permission to build on the entire area of the plots in question was sought. A copy of the
letter was endorsed to the Minister. On December 30, 1977 the Chief Engineer, Delhi Water Supply
& Sewage Disposal Undertaking wrote a letter to R.K. Mishra, General Manager, Indian Express
stating that it would cost Rs. 2.5 lakhs to divert the sewer line and that the completion of work
would take about five months after the deposit was made. This was in reply to the letter sent by
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. On October 12, 1977. Accordingly, the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
On December 31, 1977 wrote to the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing that the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi i.e. the Delhi Water supply & Sewage Disposal Undertaking had
indicated that the underground drain could be shifted 80 that it would run outside the lease hold
premises and therefore there should be no objection to the construction of the new Express
Building, and requested the Ministry for advice on the FAR permissible for the said building.

According to the note recorded by the Minister on the margin of the letter of petitioner no.3 Ram
Nath Goenka dated December 7, 1977, instructions were to be issued to the Delhi Development
Authority to examine the question. On January 7, 1977 J.B.D'Souza, Secretary, Ministry of Works &
housing recorded a detailed note and put it up to The Minister. It appears that he discussed the case
with the Minister on the 7th and explained to him that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. had
already used up an FAR of 260 with reference to their leasehold premises i.e. plot nos. 9 and 10
although they had occupied about half of the land with their building. It was recorded in the note
that the assertion that others in the press area had an FAR of 500 was not factually correct. Maxi =
FAR for all the press plots was 300 and below except in the case of Times of India where it was 304
and the National Herald where it was 306.3. According to him, the effect of allowing the petitioners
to erect similar building on the other half would mean a rise of FAR from 300 to 400. Perhaps an
increase from 260 to 360 should be permitted if the need for starting a newspaper in Hindi was
really genuine. The portion to the west of the sewer line was kept as open and was being used for
parking of cars, and these would have to be parked out on the road, apart from the extra parking
need that the additional construction would give rise to. The Minister asked the Secretary to discuss
the matter with Petitioner no.3 Ram Nath Goenka and arrive at a suitable solution. As a result, the
Secretary noted as below :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 38Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

I find it difficult to recommend the FAR requested by Shri Goenka, as this will
inevitably lead to requests from other plot-holders, including the Times of India, to
use up their entire land area for building upto 60 feet, which will mean in effect a rise
of FAR from 300 to 400. The effect on parking and other requirements may not be
acceptable.

At the same time it is undeniable that Shri Goenka is unable to retrieve from his
tenants a considerable part of his existing building, and if his needs of starting a
newspaper are really genuine some considerable concession will be needed. Perhaps
an increase from 260 to 60 should be permitted; with the extra basement area the
firm will build this should give it nearly 50,000 extra sq.feet of area.

On January 18, 1978, the Minister for Works & Housing concurred with the views of the Secretary
and ordered as below:

I agree. In the circumstances stated, 'A' above is the farthest we should accommodate.
May process further accordingly.

The Ministry of Works & Housing by letter dated February 2, 1978 conveyed to the Vice-Chairman,
Delhi Development Authority the decision of the Union of India to permit the petitioners to build
with an FAR of 360 as below:

It has been decided that FAR in this case may be increased upto 360 so that with the
extra basement area the firm would have an additional built-up area of nearly 50,000
sq.feet. You are requested to take necessary action in the matter.

Copies of this letter were endorsed to the Town & Country Planning Organization and Officer
Inchrage, Master Plan in the Delhi Development Authority. The Additional Secretary, (Master Plan),
Delhi Development Authority however maintained that the FAR permissible for the press area was
only 300 with 80 ground coverage, 70 on the first floor and 50 on the second, third and fourth
floors.

Another letter dated March 6, 1978 was addressed by petitioner no.3, Ram Nath Goenka, to the
Minister in which he reiterated the earlier request made by him for allowing the petitioners to build
on 100% of the plinth area, only with the height restriction of 60 feet. It stated that the Minister had
informed him that an order allowing the petitioners to build upto an FAR of 360 had already been
passed and further construction beyond it would be sanctioned later.

Immediately thereafter the Ministry of Works & Housing took a decision adverse to the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. On April 15, 1978, P.B. Rai, TCP-II put up a note objecting to the Government
decision to increase the FAR to 360 on the ground that it was in total contravention of the Master
Plan and would have serious implications. It is a long note, relevant part of which may be extracted :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 39Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

As per Master Plan, FAR 300 in commercial areas does not exist for any area in Delhi whatsoever.
He further stated that such a decision to permit construction upto an FAR of 360 would not be
implemented by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi as their existing bye- laws and rules permitted
construction upto 300 only and added that the rules and bye-laws should not be modified for one
particular case or building or for one particular commercial area.

Upon the receipt of the TCP-II's note, the Joint Secretary (Delhi Division) on May 6, 1978 directed
the Deputy Secretary to put up a clear note for obtaining the orders of the Secretary Ministry of
Works & Housing and the Minister because the petitioners wanted to build the 100 coverage, while
the TCP-II's note showed that the permissible FAR was 300. Accordingly, the Under Secretary put
up a detailed note on May 8, 1978 explaining the various view points, bye-laws etc. and
recommended reduction of FAR to 300. On the same day, the Deputy Secretary marked the file to
the Joint Secretary. On May 18, 1978, the Joint Secretary, (Delhi Division) pointed out that the
petitioners were A not happy with E* AR 360 against their original demand of 500 and they now
wanted FAR 430.67 while the maximum FAR permissible was 300 as pointed out by the Secretary
(Master Plan, Delhi Development Authority. He therefore recommended restriction of the FAR to
30 as per the bye-laws of the municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Secretary endorsed the said
recommendation. Therefore, the Minister approved of the restriction of the FAR to 300.

On May 19, 1978, N.E.. Botch, Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority wrote to the Joint
Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing stating that the Government's decision of FAR 360 was
totally unacceptable and added that 'making of exceptions of this nature was precisely the stick with
which the Delhi Development Authority was beaten’ for its own office building i.e. Vikas Minar
which far exceeded FAR 400 and Was in breach of all building bye-laws. He accordingly suggested
that FAR 300 might be permitted with the condition that necessary parking facilities would have to
be provided. On May 24, 1978, the Deputy Secretary recorded a note directing that further action to
implement the said decision of the Minister to restrict the FAR to 300 may be taken by the Land &
Development Officer. On June 9, 1978, the Deputy Secretary, Delhi Development Authority
informed the Vice- Chairman of the decision of the government restricting the FAR to 300
It appears that the case was revived on July 14, 1978 when Sikandar Bakht, Minister for Works &
Housing wanted to know after some representative of Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. had visited his
office, if the press area and the FAR therefor were mentioned in the Master Plan and whether or not
the FAR achieved for the Express Buildings was 500, it would not operate for fresh construction in
the press area for which the FAR was not to exceed 300. A meeting was fixed to discuss the matter
in the room of the Minister on August 18, 1978 and the following note was recorded by D'Souza,
Secretary in the Ministry of Works & Housing regarding the discussions :

The JS(D), the Vice-Chairman, DDA and I met the Minister today and explained the
undesirability of allowing the Indian Express Higher FAR than already proposed in
this case, particularly the repercussions it would have on the other occupants of plots
on this road. The Vice-Chairman suggested another possibility, namely, allotting to
the Indian Express some other land where it could put up a building. The
Vice-Chairman said he would get in touch with Shri Goenka and put this proposition

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 40Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

to him.
The Minister agreed with the Vice-Chairman's, suggestions.

On October 21, 1978, M.N. Buch, Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority took the following
decisions :

"(a) to amalgamate plots nos. 9 and 10 and taking into account the existing built-up
area would permit on FAR of 360 overall;

(b) to allow the residual area of plots nos. 9 and 10 to be built in line with the Times
of India and Shama building;

(c) to exclude the basement from the calculations of the FAR provided the basements
are not used for office purposes;

(d) to permit parking on the service road in the same manner as it was for the other
buildings in this line, adequate parking facilities would also have to be provided in
the set back of approximately half portion of the line which has been suggested by the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. in the drawings.

He further directed that the aforesaid order was to be treated as one under special appeal. He
accordingly gave instructions for issuing 'no objection’ to the Express authorities for construction on
the residual area and to make a reference to the Government of India asking for confirmation of the
action proposed. The Vice-Chairman in his order mentioned that the Minister for Works & Housing
had ordered that the cases should be cleared immediately and his ex post facto sanction obtained by
the Delhi Development Authority.

On November 4, 1978, R.D. Gohar, Joint Director (Buildings), Delhi Development Authority
addressed a letter to the petitioners to the effect :

The plans submitted by you have been examined. I am directed to inform you that
there is no objection to amalgamation of plots nos. 9 and 10 and allowing an overall
FAR of 3.6 taking into account the existing A FAR. In that case the existing building
line of the adjoining plots shall have to be maintained. The basement has been
excluded from the calculation of the FAR and the installation of Press Machinery like
any other service machinery is permitted. The parking on the service road is
permitted in the same manner as it is for other buildings in this line. However,
adequate parking facility shall have to be provided in the open area which may be so
planned to make usable for parking purposes.

On the detailed examination of the lay-out plan, he observed that as per FAR of 360 construction
was permitted on 1,84,886.07 sq.feet as against the existing FAR covering an area of 1,29,028

sq.feet i.e. the overall ground coverage now permitted was 13.81% i.e. 379 4.92 sq. feet. The

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 4Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

petitioners were directed to submit the plans to the concerned authorities for approval. A set of
plans as submitted by the petitioners and examined 'as per norms' was enclosed. On November 17,
1978, the Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority addressed a letter to the Ministry of Works
Housing recommending extension of FAR from 300 to 360.

On November 24, 1978 the Government of India, Ministry of Works & Housing addressed the
following letter to the Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority :

"No.K-12016/2/78-DDA Government of India Ministry of Works & Housing (Nirman
Aur Awas Mantralya) New Delhi, the 24th November, 1978.

To The Vice-Chairman.
Delhi Development Authority, Vikas Minar, New Delhi.
Sub: Plots nos. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi - Request for additional Coverage.

Sir, With reference to your D.O. Letter No. PA/VC/78/874 dated 17.11.78 and in supersession of this
Ministry's letter of even number dated 9.6.1978, I am directed to say that, as proposed by you, the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. may be allowed to construct on the residual plot on the basis of an
FAR 360 for the whole plots.

Yours faithfully, sd/- (V.S. Katara) Joint Secretary to the Government of India.

Copies of the letter were endorsed to the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Land &
Development Office, Town & Country Planning Organisation and Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. This
was followed by a clarificatory letter from the Ministry of Works & Housing to the Vice-Chairman
dated December 1, 1978 that the FAR 360 allowed excludes the entire area of basement as per the
provisions of the Master Plan.

The permission granted by the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing for the
construction of new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 as accorded by Sikandar Bakht,
the then Minister for Works & Housing was acted upon by the petitioners by constructing the
four-storeyed new Express Building by the end of February, 1980. As already stated, this was done
with the sanction of the Delhi Development Authority and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

Pleadings of the Parties I. Petitioners' Case In the facts and circumstances hereinbefore
adumbrated, the petitioners pleaded inter alia that :

1. The proposed action of re-entry by the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of
Works & Housing at the instance of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is meant to be
an act of political vendetta. The impugned notices have been issued with an evil eye
and an unequal hand and with a deliberate design to compel the petitioners to close
down the Express Group of Newspapers in general and the Indian Express in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 42Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

particular. The said notices are ex facie illegal and without jurisdiction and are
contrary to the factual and legal provisions. The arbitrary and discriminatory
initiation of executive action under the guise of alleged infraction of the terms of the
lease and/or the Master Plan of Delhi and/or the municipal building bye-laws is
violative of the petitioners’ fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of
the Constitution.

2. The construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 36 was in
conformity with clause 2(5) of the perpetual lease dated March 17, 1958 inasmuch as
it was with the express sanction of the lessor i.e. the Union of India. The grant of
permission by Sikandar Bakht, the then Minister for Works & Housing to sanction
the construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 was in
accordance with the Master Plan, after M.N. Buch, Vice-Chairman, Delhi
Development Authority by his order dated October 21, 1978 as one under special
appeal" under the Master Plan, Chapter II, Part A, Zoning Regulations, Item 13, Use
Zone - C-2, at p.50 directed that plots nos. 9 and 10 at Bahadurshah Zafar Marg
leased to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. should be 'amalgamated together into one
plot and taking into account the existing built-up area occupied by the old Express
Building built on the eastern portion of the underground sewage drain with an FAR
of 260, the construction of the new Express Building on the western portion thereof
after removal of the sewer line with an overall FAR of 360 was permissible’.

2. The then Minister for Works & Housing was throughout guided by the officials of
the Ministry, particularly the Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing, who was the
competent authority to act for the President with regard to any contract, grant or
assurance of property of the Union relating to any matter whatsoever in relation
thereto by virtue of the notification issued by the President under Art. 299(1). In
terms of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 as well as
under The aforesaid notification under Art.299(1), the Ministry of Works & Housing
with the Minister at the head was and is the ultimate authority responsible to deal
with the property of the Union and to enter into all contractual obligations in relation
thereto. The Minister had not only full authority, power and jurisdiction to grant
permission to the petitioners to construct the new Express Building with an increased
FAR of 360 with a double basement for the installation of the printing press, but the
action taken by the then government was in good faith after taking into consideration
all the circumstances attendant at all levels.

3. After the shifting of the underground Sewer line outside the leasehold premises at
the cost of the petitioners to the tune of Rs.6 lakhs and on payment of the supervision
charges to the Municipal Corporation amounting to Rs. 25,000, there could be no
objection to the construction of the new Express building with an increased FAR of
360 as It allowed the residual area of plots nos. 9 ant 10 to be built in line with the
Times of India, National Herald, Patriot and other buildings along the Bahadurshah
Zafar Marg. At the time of the grant of plots nos. 9 and 10 to the Express Newspapers

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

43Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Pvt. Ltd., there were no restrictions as to the FAR in the construction of buildings
along the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg. Further, that the Master Plan for Delhi
subsequently approved by the Central Government in the year 1962 does not mention
the press area on the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg comprising of the press enclave.
Although specified as a commercial area, it is not listed in the list of "already built-up
commercial areas because it relates to the walled city of Old Delhi. The zonal
development plan for D-II area within which the press plots are located permitted an
FAR of 400 for the press area in the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg. In short, the
submission is that all that the then Minister for Works & Housing did was to restore
to the petitioners the right that they acquired under the perpetual lease dated March
17, 1958 i.e.. to be treated alike all other plot holders in that area and a denial of such
equal terms would be opposed to the principles of equality besides being violative of
Art. 14 of the Constitution.

4. The lessor i.e.. the Union of India is estopped by A the doctrine of promissory
estoppel and cannot therefore go back upon all assurances given and actions taken by
the previous government, particularly when the petitioners had acted upon the
decisions so reached and had constructed the new Express Building with a cost of
approximately RS. 1.30 crore by February 1980 which at present would cost more
than Rs.. 3 crores. In substance, the petitioners contend that where permission of the
lessor i.e. the Union of India has been granted in relation to any property of the
Union under a lease by the authority competent i.e. the Ministry of Works & Housing,
it is not competent for the successor government to treat such permission as being
non est and to proceed as if no such permission or sanction had been granted.

5. The impugned notice issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi dated March 1, 1980 upon the Express Newspapers
Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the Express Buildings should not be demolished under
ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 was illegal and
ineffective inasmuch as the construction of the said building was not without or
contrary to the sanction referred to in s. 336 or in contravention of any of the
provisions of the Act or bye-laws made thereunder. The threat to demolish the
second basement especially when similar double basement/platform exists in other
newspaper buildings. in the press area such as the Times of India, National Herald
Patriot etc. along the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg was violative of Arts. 14 F and 19(1)(a)
of the Constitution. The denial of the respondents to allow such a double basement to
be constructed by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. in the new Express Building
clearly infringes the petitioners' right to free speech and expression guaranteed under
Art. 19(1)(a) which includes the freedom of the press as otherwise the printing
apparatus installed in the lower basement would be rendered incapable of operation
and is therefore a sine qua non for the printing and publication of the Indian Express.

6. The erection of the double basement or a working platform in a printing press like
the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. is a compoundable deviation from the sanctioned

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

44Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

plan and the insistence of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to demolish the same
suffers from the vice of hostile discrimination. Even assuming that the municipal
bye-laws do not permit the construction of a double basement in the press area along
the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, such bye-laws would amount to an unreasonable
restriction on the right to carry on the business of printing and publishing the
newspaper and thus offends Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

7. Respondent No.2 Jagmohan, Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi, cannot usurp the
functions of the Union of India in relation to the property of the Union in the Union
Territory of Delhi, and that the Lieutenant Governor is not a successor of the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi. There was no notification issued by the President under Art.
239(1) of the Constitution for the conferral of any power on the Lieutenant-Governor
to administer the lease in question. No doubt, by virtue of the notification issued by
the President on September 7, 1966 under Art. 239(1), the Lieutenant Governor has,
subject to the like control by the President, the same powers and functions as well as
exercisable by the Chief Commissioner with power to administer the property of the
union. There 18, admittedly, no such notification issued by the President under Art.
239(1) vesting either the Chief Commissioner of Delhi or the Lieutenant- Governor
with any such power.

8. In any event, it is inconceivable that after October 1, 1959 when the administrative
control over the Land & Development Officer was transferred from the Delhi
Administration to the Ministry of Works & Housing and by virtue of a notification
issued under Art. 299(1), the Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing was made the
competent authority to act for the President with regard to any contract, grant or
assurance of property of the Union, the Lieutenant Governor could still arrogate to
himself the powers of the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing in relation to
the lease.

9. It is alleged that respondent no. 2 Jagmohan is A actuated with personal bias
against the Indian Express and had filed a criminal complaint against the Chief
Editor of the Indian Express and some of the officers of the Express Group of
Newspapers for having published an article in the Indian Express in April 1977 with
regard to his role during the period of Emergency in Turkman Gate demolitions. The
Express Group of Newspapers, particularly the Indian Express, had during the period
of Emergency and immediately thereafter openly criticized the high handed actions
of respondent no.2 Jagmohan who was the then Vice Chairman of the Delhi
Development Authority for which he was later indicated by the Shah Commission of

Inquiry.

10. The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. contend that they having approached the
Central Government for exercise of its powers under s.41 of the Delhi Development
Act, 1954 for the issue of necessary directions as regards the permission to build the
new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

45Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

installation of the printing press which became necessary due to want of any
provision in that behalf in the Master Plan and the Zonal Development Plan in regard
to the press enclave and the Central Government having issued directions under the
relevant provisions, in terms of 8. 53(3A) of the Act, the sanction of the plan by the
Delhi Development Authority by its letter November 4,' 1978 pursuant to such
direction and its authentication of the building plans approving the portions objected
to by the Municipal Corporation, Delhi, overrides and makes irrelevant any other
sanction granted by the Municipal Corporation subject to any qualification.

11. The impugned notice issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi dated March 1, 1980 was illegal and void as he did
not apply his mind at all to the question at issue but merely issued the same at the
instance of respondent no.2. Further, the impugned notice issued by the Engineer
Officer, Land & Development Office dated March 10, 1980 purporting to act on behalf
of the lessor i.e. the Union of India was factually and legally not a notice of re-entry
upon forfeiture of the lease as contemplated by cl. 5 and 6 of the lease-deed, based as
it was on non-existent ground. Although the lease-deed permits remedy of any
breach of any of the terms thereof, the opportunity to effect such a remedy has not
been, and as indeed it is clear, it is not intended to be, granted to the petitioners and
instead, there is a threat of re-entry upon the leasehold premises upon forfeiture of
the lease. II.Respondents Case

1. Respondent No.2 Jagmohan, Lt. Governor of Delhi filed a counter on behalf of all
the respondents asserting that the perpetual lease-deed dated March 18, 1958 was
executed on behalf of the lessor by the Assistant Secretary to the Department of Local
Self Government ‘under the administrative control of the Chief Commissioner/Lt.
Governor of Delhi’; that the demise land is nazul land vested in the President of
India, for the management, control and disposal of which the Land 6 Development
Officer in the Department of Local Self Government, was created; and that as a
matter of fiscal policy, the administrative control of the Land Development Office,
New Delhi was transferred from the Delhi Administration to the Ministry of Works,
Housing and Supply w.e.f. October 1, 1959. It was asserted that this transfer was
‘purely on fiscal grounds' and did not divest the Chief Commissioner/Lt. Governor of
his contractual powers, given to him by the parties to the lease-deed, as the
representative of the President of India and the Head of the Local Self Government.
It was averred that according to cl.2(14) of the perpetual lease- deed the land to the
west of the sewer line was to be kept as an "open space" i.e. as lawns, paths or parking
grounds to the satisfaction of the Chief commissioner and only the lessor or the Chief
Commissioner hat the right to interfere with the maintenance of this area and that
too only for the purpose of laying a new sewer line along the existing one. According
to cl.2(9) thereof, no excavation in the demise premises should be made without the
written consent of the Chief Commissioner/Lt. Governor of Delhi. Admittedly, no
permission from the Chief Commissioner/Lt. Governor pursuant to cl. 2(9) and 2(14)
was obtained by the petitioners. It was further asserted that the sewer line, according

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

46Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

to the terms of the lease, could not be diverted by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi
at the cost of the petitioners without the consent of the Chief Commissioner/Lt.
Governor. The petitioners had no right under the lease to change the character of this
land which was to be maintained and by suppression of material facts obtained
permission to build thereon sanction of building plans from authorities which they
knew, under the terms of the lease was not permissible.

2. In refuting the allegations made by the petitioners that Engineer Officer, Land 6
Development Office had at the instigation of the Lt. Governor issued the impugned
notice for forfeiture of the lease, respondent no.2 asserted that he had not ordered
the issuance of the notice in question and that the Land & Development Officer was
an authority independent of the administrative control and supervision of the Lt.
Governor. It was asserted that the impugned show cause notices were issued by
authorities which are independent of the authority of Lt. Governor or by autonomous
local bodies. It was asserted : The impugned show cause notice by respondent no.5,
the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office was issued only after he came to
know through Press Reports of certain serious violations of the lease-deed by the
petitioners. The show cause notice by respondent no.5 was issued in exercise of
powers under cl.4 of the perpetual lease-deed dated March 17, 1958 for violation of cl.
2(5), 2(9) etc. As regards the impugned show cause notice issued by the Zonal
Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, lt was asserted that
the same had been issued by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi in exercise of its
statutory powers under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act after
verification of the allegations.

3. Respondent no.2 has sought to disown all responsibility for the issuances of two
impugned show cause notices but asserted that being the Lt. Governor of Delhi, he
was responsible for the administration of the Union Territory of Delhi and as such he
was acting within his powers to direct all the authorities concerned to prevent
violation of laws by any person or institution. He further asserted that he, as the Lt.
Governor of Delhi, was fully competent to appoint the Enquiry Committee under the
Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952. It was denied that the Union of India or the Lt.
Governor of Delhi intended to inflict a reprisal on the petitioners for the independent
state of the newspapers they publish. It was added : "The respondents while
welcoming, creative and constructive criticism of Government policies and actions
only expect a minimum standard of decency and fairness from the Press.

4. It was alleged that the petitioners indulged in all sorts of Distortions and
fabrications in criticizing the policies and actions of the Union of India and the Lt.
Governor" and despite all this, respondent no.2 had taken an indulgent view of these
delinquencies except when he had to file a criminal complaint against Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to uphold his self-respect and dignity ,

47Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

- and some of the petitioners have been summoned to stand their trial by a Court of
competent jurisdiction. It is not disputed that respondent no.2 had filed a criminal
complaint in Criminal Case No. Nil of 1979 in the Court of the Learned Metropolitan
Magistrate, New Delhi against petitioner no. 4 for having committed alleged offences
punishable under ss. 500 and 501 of the Indian Penal code, 1860 for having
published a news item regarding the active role played by him in the demolition of
houses near Turkman Gate in Delhi, which rendered thousands of persons destitutes
and homeless which became the subject of an enquiry by the Shah Commission
during the Emergency. Respondent no.2 makes a special pleading of the demolition
of the Turkman Gate operation during the Emergency by him as Vice Chairman of
the Delhi Development Authority which he styled as a clearance operation
undertaken for the resettlement of the vast multitude of poor people who were
victims of exploitation at the hands of vested hands and compelled to live in
sub-standard human living conditions of dirt and squalor stating that the clearance
operation was undertaken for improving the A standard of living of the poor and
their resettlement. While admitting that he had filed a criminal complaint against the
Editors, Printers and Publisher of the Indian Express for defamation, he denies that
the respondents had any personal animosity towards the Express Group of
Newspapers and asserted that the criminal complaint for defamation was instituted
because the Indian Express was guilty of fabricating and publishing false, motivated
scandalous stories about respondent no.2 and others.

5. Respondent no. 2 controverted that the contractual relations between the parties
were governed by the lease agreement dated May 26, 1954 which was modified and
superseded by the subsequent lease agreement dated November 19, 1957, since this
had also been substituted by the registered perpetual lease dated March 17, 1958
which alone, according to him, governed the relationship effectively and legally
between the Union of India and the Lt. Governor of Delhi on the one hand and the
Express Newspaper Pvt. Ltd. on the other. It was denied that the Deputy Secretary,
Ministry of Works & housing Government of India had any jurisdiction or authority
to permit diversion of the sewer line as he was not authorized to represent the Central
Government for the purpose of administration of the lease and, therefore, any
attempt on the part of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to rely upon the agreement
of 1954 or on the subsequent agreement of 1957 to justify the action of the municipal
Corporation of Delhi in shifting the sewer line beyond the leasehold permises was an
exercise in futility. It was asserted that cl. 2(5) of the perpetual lease could not be
availed of by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. in the absence of a permission
granted by representative of the lessor, meaning the Chief Commissioner/Lt.
Governor or the Land & Development Officer and, therefore, the removal of the sewer
line itself was illegal and did not create any right in the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
to raise any construction on the land to the west of the old sewer line which was to be
kept as "green". It was denied that by virtue of the transfer of functions relating to
administration of leases executed on bahalf of the Union of India, the Chief
Commissioner/ Lt. Governor was divested of all the powers conferred on him by the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

48Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

various clauses of the lease-deed. It was asserted that the transfer of the functions
was only "an administrative measure to achieve the desired fiscal discipline in the
matter of administration of properties of the Union of India. Even after the transfer
of functions to the Land & Development Officer, it was said that all lease agreements
are being referred to the Lt. Governor of Delhi for exercise of powers conferred on
him in the lease agreement. It is then said that :

"It is also denied that the Ministry of Works & Housing, as such represents the lessor.
It is the Land & Development Officers the respondent no.5, who represents the lessor
(President of India) for the execution of the leases and their administration under
Art.299(1) of the Constitution. Statutory Bodies like the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi, the Delhi Development Authority, the Urban Arts Commission etc. had no
power under the perpetual lease-deed of 1958 to vary or waive the conditions of the
lease." Upon this basis, respondents no.2 asserted that the so-called permission
obtained by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. from the Ministry of Works & Housing
was void, illegal and without jurisdiction and, therefore, a nullity in law.

In para 79, it is averred :

"With reference to para 27(b), It is denied that the Land & Development Officer is
merely a functionary under the Ministry of Works & Housing. He is, in fact, the
officer appointed on behalf of the lessor (President of India/The Chief Commissioner
of Delhi) under the terms of the lease for the execution of management of the
lease-deed, it is submitted that the permission referred to by the petitioners was
neither applied for and obtained nor granted under clause 2(5) of the lease-deed. The
so-called permission, in any case, was not addressed to be petitioner but to
respondent no.6."

6. After referring to the grant of permission by the Ministry of Works & Housing and
the Delhi Development Authority, respondent no.2 averred in para 89 :

"With reference to para 28(4) and (c) it is denied that the breach complained of was
capable of remedy. As already stated, the so-called permission obtained by the
petitioners did not amount to any valid permission under the terms of the perpetual
lease-deed dated March 18, 1958. It is submitted that the petitioners were bound to
apply to the competent authority and obtain prior approval of the lessor before
commencing construction and the petitioners knew who the competent authority was
The petitioners did not make any application under any of the terms of the lease-deed
before co missing the breach of the lease-deed.' (Emphasis supplied) The aforesaid
averments clearly bring out the stand of respondent no.2 that he alone and not the
Ministry of Works & Housing was competent to act on behalf of the lessor i.e. the
Union of India and this is brought out in the averment which immediately follows:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

49Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

"It is further submitted that for any breach of clauses (3),(9) and (10) of clause 2 of
the lease deed, it was for t‘he Chief Commissioner of Delhi to decide if the breaches
are remediable and the nature of the remedies required for the breach. If the
breaches were not remediable to the satisfaction of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi,
he could order removal or demolition of the construction complained of.
Modification of the layout plan, conversion of the land use and violation of the FAR
prescribed under the Master Plan and the Municipal Bye-laws are not remediable
breaches.

7. Respondent no.2 has specifically denied that the FAR for D-2 area which includes
the Press Enclave is 400, and asserted that for built up areas which include partly
built-up areas, the FAR under the Municipal Building Bye-laws is only 300. It was
then asserted that the FAR for D-2 area being 300, according to the Municipal
Building Bye-laws and the Master Plan for Delhi, the question of issue of direction by
the Central Government under s.41 of the Delhi Development Act does not arise.
Even then, it was said that the Vice-Chairman of the Delhi Development Authority
(M.N. Buch), in view of this legal position expressed the view in his note dated
October 21, 1978 that the case of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. should be treated
as an isolated case to bring it at par and allow the FAR of 360 overall. According to
him the reason for this as indicated in the note was that the order of Shri Sikander
Bakht, Minister for Works & Housing for immediate clearance of the case and for
obtaining his ex-post-facto sanction". Respondent No.2 denied that the letters
referred to in para 30(h) and (i) of the petition could be construed as directions of the
Central Government to the Delhi Development Authority under 8. 41 of the Delhi
Development Act. Instead of being such a direction, the Annexure 21 was a
clarification of letter dated November 25, 1978 stating that FAR 360 was allowed
excluding the basement. Annexure 22 was said to be a sanction letter issued by
respondent no.1 on January 9, 1979 in respect of building plans submitted by the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. before respondent no.3. Even Annexure 20 which is a
letter dated November 24, 1978 from the Ministry of Works & Housing, it was said
was not a permission under s. 41 of the Delhi Development Act as it gives the
ex-post-facto sanction of the proposal of the Delhi Development Authority permitting
FAR 360 for the Express newspapers Pvt. Ltd. It was then added :

"With reference to para 30(j), it is denied that the actions taken by the Ministry of
Works & Housing and the Delhi Development Authority constituted a restoration of
the rights of the petitioners under the lease agreement of 1954, as the agreement of
1954 was inadmissible being non- existent and inoperative after its substitution by
the agreement of 1957 as per perpetual lease-deed dated March 18, 1958, it was
asserted that the petitioners could construct on the residual area of plots nos. 9 and
10 only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the lease-deed of 1958 and
subject to the provisions of the Master Plan and the Municipal Bye-laws. It was
asserted that the lease deed of 1958 envisaged compliance with the Municipal
Bye-laws for any future constructions/additions in plots nos. 9 and

"

10.

8. It will be seen that the points ought to be made out by respondents no.2 in his
counter- affidavit are :

(a) At present the perpetual lease-deed dated March 18, 1958 governs the
relationship effectively between the Union of India and the Lt. Governor on the one
hand and the petitioners on the other i.e. the relations between the parties.

(b) The transfer of administrative control of the L & O on October 1, 1959 to the
Ministry of Works & Housing did not divest the Chief Commissioner of hi contractual
powers given under the lease and he alone represented the lessor i.e. the union of
India and not the Ministry of Works & housing

(c) The sewer, according to the terms of the lease-deed, could not be diverted without
the consent of the Chief Commissioner (Lt. Governor) and the approval of the
Ministry of Works & Housing was a nullity being without jurisdiction and legal
competence.

(d) For the commercial user of the residual area to be kept a ‘green’, it is only the
Chief Commissioner (Lt. Governor) who could give sanction to construct for the
commercial user at the residual area; the petitioners were liable to pay commercial
realization charges.

(e) The Lt. Governor was a successor of the Chief Commissioner and therefore, the
powers exercisable by the Chief Commissioner in relation to the lease vested in him.

(f) It is for the Chief commissioner (Lt. Governor) to decide if the breaches were
remediable or as to the nature of the remedies required for the breach.

According to him, the breaches are not remediable breaches and, therefore, the
impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 issued by the Engineers Officer, L & DO for
re-entry upon the land on forfeiture of the lease for breach of the conditions was valid
and proper. (The learned Attorney-General has throughout in the course of his
arguments on behalf of respondent no.1, the Union of India maintained that the Lt.
Governer of Delhi had nothing to do with the lease and that wherever the name of the
Chief Commissioner of Delhi appears, it should be scored out from the lease-deed.)
(Emphasis supplied)

g. One S. Rangaswami, Additional Land & Development Officer, Ministry of Works &
Housing filed a separate counter-affidavit supporting the stand of the Lt. Governor. It
was averred in para 3 :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

51Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

"The petitioners during the year 1977 applied to the Ministry of Works & Housing for
permission to construct on the residual area of 2740 square yards in plots nos. 9 and
10. The petitioners have placed reliance on the letters dated June 9, 1978 from Shri L.
N. Sukwami and dated 24th November 1978 from Shri V.S. Katara in the Ministry of
Works & Housing and claimed that these two letters constituted permission to build
on the residual area of plots nos. 9 and 10. I am advised , to state that under the
terms of the lease deed of 1958, previous consent of either the President of India or
the chief Commissioner (Lt. Governor) or such officer or body as the lessor (President
of India) or the chief Commissioner of Delhi authorised was necessary for building
activity on the residual area of the plots (2740 sq. yards) the Ministry of Works &
Housing did not represent the lessor or the chief commissioner.

10. It is somewhat strange that Land & Development Officer, who is the last
functionary in the Ministry of Works & Housing should challenge the very authority
and power of the Ministry of Works & Housing to administer the lease on behalf of
the President of India. He has also averred in para 5 :

"The impugned show cause notice of 10th March 1980 was issued to the petitioners
under cl. 6 of the perpetual lease for violation of sub-clauses (5) and (14) of clause 2
of the lease-deed. The Land & Development Officer is not a functionary under the
Ministry of Works & Housing . He officer appointed on behalf of the lessor to
administer the lease. At no stage the petitioners approached the office of Land
Development for permission to construct on the residual area of 2740 sq. yards to the
west of the pipe-line and no approval was obtained from the office of L&DO for
construction of a building in contravention of clauses 2(5), (9) and (14) of the lease.
The so-called permissions and approvals obtained by the petitioners have no legal
validity on the short ground of lack of legal competence or authority under the terms
of the lease-deed which governed the relationship between the petitioners and
respondent no. 1."

(Emphasis supplied) The case has seen many twists aud turns. The hearing
commenced on April 27, 1982 and was concluded on September 22, 1983 with
intermittence breaks. I regret to say that the ambivalent attitude adopted by
respondent no.1 the Union of India and the hostility of respondent no.2 prolonged
the hearing which lasted as many as 43 days. This has resulted in a colossal waste of
public money and valuable time of the court. On April 29, 1982 when Shri Nariman,
learned counsel for the petitioners had concluded his arguments for the day.

Shri Parasaran, the learned Solicitor General made a statement that he wanted to obtain
instructions as to whether the impugned notices issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), Municipal
Corporation of Delhi dated March 1, 1980 and by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office,
dated March 10, 1980 for the forfeiture of the lease of plots nos. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg
granted by the Government of India in favour of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. and the threat to
re-enter upon the leasehold premises with the new Express Building built thereon and for removal

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 52Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

of the unauthorized structures should be enforced or not. In the facts and circumstances of the case,
we must say that the request for adjournment by the learned Solicitor General was reasonable and
was not opposed by the learned counsel for the petitioners. We accordingly adjourned the hearing of
the Writ Petitions till August 3, 1983 to enable respondent no.1 the Union of India to take a decision
in the matter. On August 23, 1982 the matter was taken up in Chambers when the learned Solicitor
General made a statement that the Writ Petitions would have to be heart on merits, meaning
thereby that the lessor i.e. the Union of India were not prepared to reconsider the matter. The
learned Solicitor & General later withdrew from the case.

The strange phenomenon when the hearing was resumed on November 4, 1982 of the Union of
India speaking through the voice of learned counsel for respondent no.2 was more than we could
permit. We sent for Shri L.N. Sinha, the learned Attorney General and he rightly objected to anyone
speaking on behalf of the Union of India. We directed the learned Attorney General to appear and
assist the Court.

During the pendency of the proceedings, Shri Sinha demitted his office and Shri Parasaran was
appointed to be the Attorney General. The Union of India engaged Shri Sinha as its counsel and he
continued to represent respondent no.1. We are grateful to learned counsel for the parties who dealt
with all aspects of the various constitutional issues and other questions of great public importance
with their usual industry and have supplemented their arguments by filing written submissions.
Learned counsel for respondent no .1 has throughout been emphatic in contending that respondent
no.2 was a complete stranger to the lease and he did not represent the lessor, the Union of India.
Strangely enough, Dr. Singhvi continued to appear not only for respondent no.2 the Lt.Governor but
also for respondent no.5 the Land & Development Officer who is a minor official in the Ministry of
Works & Housing. When we repeatedly enquired from learned counsel for respondent no.1 as to the
right of respondent no.5 to be represented by another counsel when he was appearing for the Union
of India, he asserted that Dr. Singhvi had no right to represent respondent no.5 Land &
Development Officer as he was appearing for respondent no.1 and he was not bound by his
submissions. Again, there was a rather disturbing feature. Submissions at the bar by learned counsel
for the respondents were not in consonance with the stand taken in the original affidavit filed by
respondent no.2 on behalf of all the respondents. Further, the respondents have been fillings
different affidavits from time tc time to suit their purposes as the hearing progressed and it was
difficult to reconcile the conflicting averments made in these subsequent Affidavits. It is somewhat
unfortunate that the Government should have embarked upon this course of action.

At the resumed hearing on November 4, 1982, we took on A record the further affidavits filed by
respondent no.2 dated July 29, 1982 with certain deletions. In trying to meet the allegations made
against him, respondents no.2 cast aspersions on Sikandar Bakht, the then Minister for Works &
Housing. It was averred :

"But if Ram Nath Goenka approached the then Minister of Works & Housing, Shri
Sikandar Bakht and the latter misusing his authority and exercising blatant
favouritism pressurised the officers of the Delhi Development Authority, Delhi
Municipal Corporation and of his own Ministry to do totally illegal acts, thereby

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 53Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

giving huge financial benefits to his political associate and friend Ram Nath Goenka,
there are no mala fides. If the statutory provisions unalterable through an executive
action, of the Delhi Master Plan, Zoning Regulations and Municipal Bye-laws are
ruthlessly violated, there are no mala fides. If expert advice of the Town & Country
Planning Organisation is deliberately attacked, which, in fact, makes it quite clear
that FAR 300 does not exist in any area in Delhi and that FAR and coverage are
prescribed for the locality as a whole and not for individual building, there are no
mala fides. And if senior officers are sent to an influential businessman to mollify him
and in the event of not being mollified, the illegal and irregular concessions asked for
are granted without even taking the trouble of amending the law of the statutory
provisions, there are no mala fides, according to the writ petitioners-"

On the same day i.e. On November 4, 1982, we sent for Shri L.N. Sinha, the then Attorney-general
and drew his attention to the averments made by respondents no. 7 in the fresh affidavit alleging
that the orders passed by the then Minister for Works & Housing were illegal, improper & irregular.
We felt that it was highly improper for respondent no.2 to have made such extreme allegations
against the then Minister for Works & Housing and against the previous Government in power.
Accordingly, we called upon respondent no.1 Union of India to clarify its stand with regard to the
following aspects:

1. The authority of respondent no.2 to make allegations of fraud , misuse of powers
and misdemeanors against the functionaries of the Union of India including the
Minister, Works & Housing.

2. The stand of respondent no.1, Union of India, to the case of the petitioners without
adopting the counter affidavit of respondent no.2.

3. The specific reply, if any, of the Union of India to the allegations of mala fides
made by the petitioners against the Government of India in paras 9(b). 11 and 12 of
the Writ Petition.

4. What is the reaction of the Union of India to the averments in the
counter-affidavits of respondent no.2 and the affidavit of respondent no. 5 that the
Ministry of Works & Housing does not represent the lessor and that respondent no.5,
the Land & Development Officer alone represents the lessor. And

5. Whether a successor government was not bound by the acts of the duly constituted
previous government ?

Instead of complying with the directions, respondent no.1 through the affidavit of M.K. Mukherjee,

Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing dated November 16, 1982 purported to raise certain
additional issue :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 54Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

11 am advised to say that the orders passed by Shri Sikandar Bakht, the then Minister
for Works & Housing were clearly illegal, improper and irregular.

2. The powers and functions assigned to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi under the
lease-deed were exercisable by the Lt. Governor by virtue of the notification issued by
the President dated September 7, 1966 under Art. 239(1) of the Constitution.

3. The Land & Development Officer as well as the Chief Engineer in the office of the
Land & Development Officer were both empowered to take action of the lease-deed
and therefore the Engineer Officer was authorized by the lessor i.e. the Union of
India to issue the impugned show cause notice as he was competent to do so under cl.
5 of the lease-deed having been empowered to act on behalf of the President under
Art. 299(1). The said show cause notice was issued on the basis of which a press
report as per the orders recorded on the file of the Land & Development Officer and
not at the instance of the Lt. Governor.

4. The order of M.N. Buch, the then Vice- Chancellor of the DDA dated October 21,
1978 was without any legal authority or sanction and the said order was passed by
him in clear violation of the procedure laid down in s. 11A(2) of the Delhi
Development Act, inasmuch as no relaxation of the permission for FAR for the D-II
area could be made which was tantamount to a modification of the Master Plan. The
said decision cannot be implemented by the MCD because it would require
modification of their existing bye-laws, which cannot be done for a particular case or
building or for one particular commercial area.

It is then averred :

"I say that the counter-affidavit filed by respondent no.2 be read as part and parcel of
this counter-affidavit.

I am advised to categorically deny any allegation of mala fides, design or animosity
on the part of respondent no.1 as alleged.

The respondents have also placed on record two affidavits of M.N. Buch and H.R. Ailawadi, both of
whom became Vice-Chairmen, Delhi Development Authority. Ailawadi in his affidavit avers that the
demised land is a nazul land which vested in the President of India. For management, control and
disposal of such lands, Land & Development Office in the Department of Local Self Government was
created. As a matter of fiscal policy, the administrative control of the Land & Development Office,
Delhi was transferred from the Delhi Administration to the Ministry of Works, Housing & Supply
w.e.f. October 1, 1959. He asserts that this transfer was on administration and fiscal grounds and did
not divest the Chief Commissioner of the powers given to him by the parties under the lease as the
representative of the President of India. He further avers that the sewer line, according to the terms
of the lease, could not be diverted without the consent of the Chief Commissioner (Lt.Governor). As
regards the sanction, he asserts that M.N. Buch in fact had no authority to sanction the building

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 55Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

plans in the instant case and that the Additional Secretary, Master Plan, had raised certain
objections to the building plans and no decision on these objections was taken and then adds :

"Shri Buch contrary to all the views expressed by himself, the Ministry of Works &
Housing, Office of L&DO and TCPO passed the following orders.

This is followed by the terms of the order in question passed by M.N. Buch. He then avers:

"Under clause 2(5) of the perpetual lease-deed only the lessor or the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi could permit construction on the residual area of plots no. 9
and 10. The Vice-Chairman, DDA had no authority under the terms of the lease to
permit an additional construction on these plots. No objection certificate, therefore,
issued to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and to M/s Express Newspapers Ltd. by
the DDA on 4.11.1979 was without jurisdiction and a nullity. The Ministry of Works &
Housing could not have also permitted any construction at the residual area. Only the
Chief Commissioner of Delhi or the Officers authorized by the President of India
under Art. 299 of the Constitution were competent to grant such permission. The
Vice-Chairman, DDA or the Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Works & Housing were
not authorized by the President in exercise of powers under Art. 299 to administer
the lease- deed.

The direction of Shri Buch to treat his order as one under special appeal was without
jurisdiction and, therefore, a nullity. The procedure prescribed for special appeal was
totally disregarded. No resolution of the DDA was adopted in this regard and as a
matter of practice and rule, special appeal cases are decided only by means of
resolution of the authority. The decision of Shri Buch was in violation of the
provisions of the Delhi Development Act, Master Plan and Municipal Bye-laws.

He then questioned the validity of the sanction to the building plan granted by the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi and asserts :

"Sanction of the building plans by the MCD violated the following statutory
provisions :

(a) FAR : According to the Municipal Bye-laws, FAR for a built area could not exceed
300. The Press area being a built up area, permission to build up to FAR to 360 was
violative of the Municipal Building Bye-laws.

(b)Coverage : According to the Master Plan and A building bye-laws, which were in
force prior to 24.12.76, coverage for different floors of a five storey building was as

under :
Ground floor 80%
First " 70%
Second " 50%

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 56Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Third " 50%
Fourth " 50%

He then refers to the amended rule dated 24.12.76 which prescribed for all
commercially developed areas, including offices, coverage of 25% and asserts that the
press area is covered by the amendment. He also asserts that even the earlier rule was
violated by allowing 75.43% on the first floor and 77.5 coverage on the second and
third floors.

Further he states that for commercial areas, parking has to be done within the plots and within the
covered area. In the present case, no provision was made for parking of the vehicle within the plot
and then adds :

"In the Municipal Bye-laws, there is no provision for waiving, relaxing and modifying
the rules referred to above. The sanction was, therefore, accorded illegally and under
undue pressure from vested interests.

In his counter-affidavit, M.N Buch avers in para 3 that he had not authorized respondent no.2 or
anyone else to swear an affidavit on his behalf and, therefore, he was not bound by the same.
According to him, the area in question was not a development area within the meaning of sub-s.(3)
of s. 12 of the Delhi Development Act and as such, question of according any permisson/approval by
the Delhi Development Authority or by any of its officers did not arise. As regards the
communication dated November 4, 1978 issued under the signature of R.D. Gohar, the then Joint
Director (Building) of the Delhi Development Authority, it could not, in his opinion, be treated to be
a permission/sanction accorded under any statutory rule or regulation or Bye-law. According to him
it was as a matter of fact a formal correspondence in response to a reference made in that behalf by
the Ministry of Works & Housing and its gist and essence was that the petitioners could submit
plans to the concerned authorities for approval, if they so chose and that was why, the set of plans as
submitted by them, was returned and no plans were ever approved. On the contrary, the plans were
returned for submission to the appropriate authority for approval. As regards a number of
communications from the Ministry of Works & Housing to him, as the then Vice- Chairman, M.N.
Buch contended that he had no access to the records of the Delhi Development Authority and due to
non- availability of the records, it was difficult for him to say anything specifically about the same.

In substance, the contention of Buch is that the area in question was not a duly notified
development area" and as such, question of granting any permission either by the Delhi
Development Authority or by him as the Vice-Chairman did not arise and that no sanction or
approval of the building plans, as alleged or otherwise, was accorded by him as such. The point of
FAR raised in the petition was, according to him, not at all relevant for a just and proper decision of
the case. He further stated that a perusal of the records would reveal that nowhere in any of the
communications had he stated that any building plan had been sanctioned or approved. On the
contrary, he had made it clear that:

"It is for the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to examine the building plans in the light
of the Building Bye-laws already sanctioned by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 57Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

In other words, neither the Delhi Development Authority nor he as the
Vice-Chairman had anything to do with the sanction/approval of the building plans
in the instant case .

It is rather pertinent to observe that in his counter
affidavit Buch does not explain the implications of his specific order as the Vice-Chairman dated
October 21, 1978 for amalgamation of plots nos.g9 and 10 and permitting construction of the new
Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for installation of the
printing press, directing that it was not merely a communication from the Vice-Chairman, Delhi
Development Authority to the Ministry of Works & Housing but per se it was an order passed by
M.N. Buch as Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority and he concludes by observing :

"The Minister, Works & Housing had discussed the case with me and ordered that the
case should be cleared immediately and his ex-post-facto sanction obtained. On this
basis, we may issue clearance to the Express Authorities and also make a reference to
the Government of India asking for confirmation of the action taken. 'The order
should be treated as an order under Special Appeal’.

A perusal of the counter-affidavit of M.N. Buch bears out that the maker or an instrument is not
always its best interpreter. Nothing really turns on the aforesaid two affidavits of M.N. Buch and
H.R. Ailawadi, the then Vice- Chairman OF the Delhi Development Authority which was just a
belated attempt of the respondents to support the action of respondent no.2 in initiating the
proceedings which culminated in the issue of the impugned notices. The respondents have been
shifting their stand from stage to stage.

Upon these pleadings, the point for determination that arise may be formulated :

1. Whether the impugned notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease by the Engineer
Officer, Land & Development Office, Ministry of Works & Housing dated March 10,
1980 requiring Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the lessor i.e. the
Union of India should not re-enter upon and taken possession of plots nos. 9 and 10,
Bahadurshah Zafar Marg together with the Express Buildings built thereon and the
impugned notice of the Zonal Engineer (Buildings), Municipal Corporation, City
Zone, Delhi to show cause why the new Express building particularly the double
basement, where the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. have installed the printing press
with the working platform which was a necessary appurtenance to the installation of
the printing press expressly sanctioned by the then Minister for Works & Housing as
well as by M.N. Buch, the then Vice-Chairman, DDA in conformity with Delhi
Development Act, 1957, the Master Plan and under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, were violative of the petitioners’ right to freedom of
press guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) read with Art. 14 of the Constitution and therefore a
petition under Art. 32 was maintainable.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 58Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

2. Whether the construction of the new Express BUILDING on the residual area of
2740 square yards to the west of sewer-line after its removal on plots nos. 9 and 10
without the permission of the Lt. Governor or of the Land & Development Officer by
the petitioners with an increase FAR increase continued breach of clauses 2(5) and 2
(14) which entitled the Engineers Officer, Land & Development Office. Ministry of
Works & Housing to issue the impugned show cause notice dated March 10, 1980 of
re-entry upon forfeiture of lease and the Union of India to re-enter upon and take
possession of plots 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, together with the Express
buildings thereon.

3. (a) Whether under the Master Plan, development of the Mathura Road commercial
area was totally prohibited on FAR exceeding 300 i.e. whether such area does fall
within the expression ‘already built-up commercial area' or whether The Master Plan
does not refer to the Mathura Road commercial area nor does such area fall within
the expression ‘already built-up commercial area’ i.e. the area falling within the
walled city of Delhi.

(b) Whether the permitted users in the Use-Zone C- II viz. the zone in which the
present area falls do not exclude 'newspaper and printing press' except only if such
user is allowed by a competent authority after special appeal that newspaper and
printing presses are permitted to be installed.

4. Whether the Ministry of Works & Housing with the Minister at the head was and is
the ultimate authority responsible for the following items of works 'Property of the
Union, Town and Country Planning, Delhi Development Authority, Master Plan of
Delhi, Administration of the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the Land Development
Office dealing with the administration of Nazi Lands in the Union Territory of Delhi.
If that be so whether the orders passed by Sikandar Bakht, the then Minister for
Works & housing granting permission to the petitioners to construct the new Express
Building with an increased FAR 360 on an area of 2740 square yard to the west of
plots no8. 9 And 10 was illegal, improper and irregular.

5. Whether the decision taken by the then Minister for Works & Housing for
permitting construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360
with a double basement for the installation of the printing press was in conformity
with the recommendation of M.N. Buch, the then Vice- Chairman, Delhi
Development Authority and had been reached after the matter had been dealt with at
all levels in the Ministry of Works & Housing was binding upon the successor
Government i.e. the Union of India as also the Ministry of Works & Housing and the
petitioners having acted in the faith of such assurance and constructed the new
Express Building thereon at a cost of nearly Rs.2 crores, the respondents particularly
respondent no.1, the Union of India, was precluded by the doctrine of promissory
estoppel from challenging the validity of the permission granted by the then Minister
for Works & Housing. If that be so, whether the present government is bound to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

59Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

honour all assurances given by or on bahalf of the Union of India, Ministry of Works
& Housing by the then Minister.

6. Whether the Lt. Governor of Delhi has any function in relation to the lease being a
successor of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi. If that be so, whether the Lt. Governor
of Delhi could have set up a threeman Committee to inquire into and report on the
alleged breaches committed by the petitioners in the construction of the new Express
Building with an increased FAR of 360 or the double basement for installation of the
printing press, contrary to the sanction plan and the building bye-laws of the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi. If that be so, whether the Engineer Officer, Land &
Development Office could have acted on the press report of the news conference held
by the Lt. Governor and on its basis issue the impugned show cause notice dated
March 10, 1980.

7. Whether the respondents are right in contending that the alleged breach
committed by the petitioners in not obtaining the previous permission of the Lt.
Governor as required by cls. 2(5) and 2(14) was not remedial and therefore the lessor
i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing could direct removal or
demolition of the construction complained of.

8. Whether the notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease issued by the Engineer
Officer, Land & Development Office, New Delhi dated March 10, 1980 purporting to
be on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing, and
that of March 1, 1980 issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), Municipal
Corporation, City Zone, Delhi, were wholly mala fide and politically motivated.

For a proper appreciation of the points involved, it is necessary to set out the material clauses of the
indenture of lease-deed dated March 17, 1958. Clauses 2(5), 2(14), 4, 5 and 6, insofar as material,
run as follows :

"2(5). The lessee will not without the previous consent in writing of the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi or of such officer or body as the lessor or the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi may authorize in this behalf make any alterations in or
additions to the building erected on the said demised premises so as to affect any of
the architectural or structural features thereof or suffer to be erected on any part of
the said demised premises or any building other than and except the building erected
thereon at the date of these presents." "2.(14). The lessee shall keep to the entire
satisfaction of the said Chief Commissioner the area to the west of the pipeline
admeasuring 2740 sq.yards (which area for clarity's sake is delienated on the plan
hereto annexed and thereon shown in yellow) as an open space, that is, as lawns,
paths or parking grounds."

"4. If there shall at any time have been in the opinion of the Lessor or the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi whose decision shall be final, any breach by lessee or by any

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 60Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

person claiming through or under him of any of the covenants or conditions
contained in sub-cls. (5)....... of cl.2 and if the said intended lessee shall neglect or fail
to remedy any such breach to the satisfaction of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi
within seven days from the receipt of a notice signed by the Chief Commissioner of
Delhi requiring him to remedy such breach it shall be lawful for the officers of the
Chief Commissioner of Delhi to enter upon the premises hereby demised and (a) to
remove or demolish any alterations on or additions to the buildings erected on the
said premises without the previous consent in writing of the Chief Commissioner of
Delhi or duly authorized officer as aforesaid........ and it is hereby expressly declared
that the liberty hereinbefore given is not to prejudice in any way the power given to
the President of India by cls. 4 and 5 hereof.

Bi cesses (1)f there shall have been in the opinion of the Lessor or the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi whose decision shall be final, any breach by the Lessee or by
any person claiming through or under him of any of the covenants or conditions
hereinbefore contained and on his part to be observed or performed then and in any
such case it shall be lawful for the lessor or any person or persons duly authorized by
him notwithstanding the waiver of any previous cause or right of re-entry upon any
part of the premises whereby demised or of the buildings thereon in the name of the
whole to re-enter and thereupon this demise and everything herein contained shall
cease and determine and the Lessee shall not be entitled to any compensation
whatsoever, nor, to the return of any premium paid by him."

6. "No forfeiture of re-entry shall be effected except as herein provided, without the
permission of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi, and the Chief Commissioner shall
not permit such forfeiture or re-entry until the Lessor has served on the lessee a
notice in writing :

(a) specifying the particular breach complained of

(b) if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the Lessee to remedy the breach and
the Lessee fails within a resonable time from the date of service of the notice to
remedy the breach, if it is capable of remedy, and in the event of forfeiture of re-entry
the Chief Commissioner may in his discretion relieve against forfeiture on such terms
and conditions as he thinks proper."

The Acts We may then refer to the relevant provisions of the Delhi Development Act,
1957 which is paramount law on the subject and overrides the provisions of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. The word 'Building' is defined in section 2(b) as
including any structure or erection or part of a structure or erection which is
intended to be used for residential, industrial, commercial or other purposes,
whether in actual use or not; And the term ‘building operations as defined in section
2(c) includes rebuilding operations, structural alterations of or additions to buildings
and other operations normally undertaken in connection with the construction of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/

61Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

buildings. In section 2(d) the term 'development' is defined with all its grammatical
variations to mean the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other
operations in, on, over or under land or the making of any material change in
building or land and includes redevelopment. The expression 'development area’ is
defined in section 2(e) to mean any area declared to be the development area under
sub-s.(1) of s.12.

Under the scheme of the Act, the predominant object and purpose for which the Delhi Development
Authority is constituted under s.3(1) is to secure the planned development of Delhi. This has to be
achieved by the preparation of Master Plan under s.7(1) and Zonal Development Plans under s.8(1).
Under s.3(3)(a) the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi shall be the Chairman ex-officio of
the Delhi Development Authority. Under s. 6 the Authority is charged with the duty to promote and
secure the development of Delhi according to plan. The Master Plan as enjoined under s. 7(2)(a)
defines the various zones into which Delhi may be divided for the purpose of development and
indicates the manner in which the land in each zone is proposed to be used (whether by the carrying
out thereon on development or otherwise) and the stages by which any such development shall be
carried out; and by cl.(b) thereof serves as a basic pattern of frame-work within which the zonal
development plans of the various zones may be prepared. S. 12(1) provides that as soon as may be
after the commencement of this Act, the Central Government may, by notification in the Official
Gazette, declare any area in Delhi to be a development area for the purposes of this Act. After the
commencement of the Act, s. 12(3) enjoins that no development of land shall be undertaken or
carried out in any area by any person or body (including a department of government) unless,
(i) "where that area is a development area permission for such development has been
obtained in writing from the Authority in accordance with the provisions of this Act,
i.e. according to the Master Plan and the Zonal Development Plans;

(ii) where that area is an area other than a development area, approval of, or sanction
for, such development has been obtained in writing from the local authority
concerned or any officer or authority thereof empowered or authorized in this behalf,
in accordance with the provisions made by or under the law governing such authority
or until such provisions have been made in accordance with the provisions of the
regulations relating to the grant of permission for development made under the Delhi
(Control of Building Operations) Act, 1955, and in force immediately before the
commencement of this Act:"

It is common ground that the Press Enclave on the Mathura Road Commercial Complex has not
been declared under s. 12(1) to be a development area for purposes of the Act. S.14 provides that
after the coming into operation of any of the plans in a zone no person shall use or permit to be used
any land or building in that zone otherwise than in conformity with such plan. $.29(1) makes it a
penal offence to undertake or carry out development of any land in contravention of the Master Plan
or Zonal Development Plans or without the permission, approval or sanction referred to in s. 12 or
in contravention of any condition subject to which such permission, approval or sanction has been
granted. S.53(3) is important for our purpose and it reads :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 62Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

53(3):"Notwithstanding anything contained in any such other law
(a) when permission for development in respect of any land has been obtained under
this Act such development shall not be deemed to be unlawfully undertaken or
carried out by reason only of the fact that permission, approval or sanction required
under such other law for such development has not been obtained;

(b) when permission for which development has not been obtained under this Act,
such development shall not be deemed to be lawfully undertaken or carried out by
reason only or the fact that permission, approval or sanction required under such
other law for such development has been obtained."

The words 'such other law' in s. 53(3) obviously refer to the non-obstante clause in sub-s. (2) which
reads :

53(2):"... The provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations made thereunder
shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any
other law. " i.e. the provisions of the Act have a overriding effect over the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.

The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 provides inter alia by s. 332 that no person shall erect or
commence to erect any building, or execute any of the works specified in s. 334 except with the
previous sanction of the Commissioner, nor otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter (Chapter XVI) and of the bye-laws made under this Act in relation to the erection of
buildings or execution of works. $.334(1) provides that every person who intends to carry on any
work of the type indicated e.g. in addition to or alterations in any building or the repairs or
alterations of the kind specified shall apply for sanction by giving notice in writing of his intention to
the Commissioner in such form and containing such information as may be prescribed by bye-laws
made in that behalf. S. 336(1) provides that the Commissioner shall sanction the erection of a
building or the execution of a work unless such building or work would contravene any of the
provisions of sub-s(2) of that section. Sub-s.(2)(a) provides for one of the grounds on which sanction
of building or work may be refused viz.where such building or work or the use of the site for the
building or work would contravene the provisions of any bye-law made in that behalf or of any other
law made in such other law. Sub-s. (3) provides that the Commissioner shall communicate the
sanction to the person who has given the notice; and where he refuses sanction on any of the
grounds specified in sub-s.(2) or under s. 340 he shall record a brief statement of his reasons for
such refusal and communicate the refusal alongwith the reasons therefor to the person who has
given the notice. S.343(1) provides inter alia that where the erection of any building or execution of
any work has been commenced, or is being carried on, or has been completed without or contrary to
the sanction referred to in s.

336....... The Commissioner may in addition to any other section that may be taken under the Act,
make an order directing that such erection or work shall be demolished. Proviso thereto enjoins that

no such order of demolition shall be made unless a person has been afforded a reasonable

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 63Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

opportunity of showing cause by a notice in writing as to why such order shall not be made.
Sub-s.(2) provides that the person aggrieved may prefer an appeal against an order of demolition
passed under sub-s.(1) to the District Judge. Sub-s.(3) confers power on the District Judge to order
stay of demolition. Sub-s.(5) thereof provides that the order made by the District Judge on appeal
and subject only to such order, the order of demolition made by the Commissioner shall be final and
conclusive. Likewise s. 344(1) provides that where the erection of any building or execution of any
work has been commenced or is being carried on but has not been completed, without or contrary to
the sanction referred to in s. 336 or in contravention of any conditions subject to which sanction has
been accorded or any contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or bye-law made thereunder,
the Commissioner may by order require the person at whose instance the building or work has been
commenced or is being carried on to stop the same forthwith. The remaining sub-sections of s.344
are, similar to those as contained in s.343. I may now proceed to deal with the questions that have
been raised.

Maintainability of the Writ petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution.

The contention that these petitions are not maintainable under Art.32 of the Constitution leaves me
cold. Some of the crucial questions that arise have been formulated hereinbefore. These are: (1)
Whether the impugned notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease dated March 10, 1980 issued by
the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office under cl.5 of the lease-deed and that of the Zonal
Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal Corporation, Delhi dated March 1, 1980 to show cause
why the Express Buildings should not be demolished as unauthorized construction under ss. 343
and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 were arbitrary and irrational without any
factual basis and were therefore violative of Art. 19(1)(a) read with Art. 14 of the Constitution. (2)
Whether the Lt. Governor was a successor of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi in terms of the
lease-deed and whether by virtue or the notification issued by the President under Art. 239(1) of the
Constitution, he could exercise any power in relation to lease of Government lands in the Union
Territory of Delhi. (3) Whether under the paramount law i.e. the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the
Master Plan for Delhi and the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area, the permissible FAR
prescribed for buildings constructed in the Press Enclave on the Mathura Road Commercial
Complex was

400. And (4) Whether the new Express Building constructed with an increased FAR of 360 with a
double basement for installation of the printing press for publication of a Hindi newspaper, with the
permission of the lessor, the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing, constitutes a breach of
the Master Plan or the Zonal Development Plans or clauses 2(5) and 2(14) of the lease-deed. These
questions which obviously arise on these petitions under art. 32 of the Constitution and any
direction for quashing the impugned notices must necessarily involve determination of these
questions. I regret that my learned brother Venkataramiah, J. proposes to express no opinion on the
questions on which, in my view, the Writ Petitions turn.

The question at the very threshold is: Whether these petitions under Art.32 are maintainable.
Learned counsel appearing for the Union of India raised a preliminary objection which he later

developed as his main argument in reply. First, there was in the present case no question of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 64Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

infraction of the freedom of the press comprehended within the freedom of speech and expression
guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) but the enforcement of the Master Plan for Delhi and the Zonal
Development Plan framed under the Delhi Development Act, 1957 and the Delhi Municipal
Corporation (Building) Bye-laws, 1959 may at the most amount to a restriction on the fundamental
rights of the petitioners to carry an their business guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(g). Secondly, the right
to occupy the land leased for the construction of a building for installation of a printing press is not
within Art.19(1)(a) nor within Art. 19(1)(g) but such a right is derived from a grant or contract. Such
a right is certainly not within the content of Art.19(1)(a) or Art. 19(1)(g). It is argued that the right
arising out of a statute or out of a contract cannot be a fundamental right itself. Once a contract is
entered into or a grant is made, the rights and obligations of the parties are not governed by Part III
of the Constitution, but by the terms of the document embodying the contract or the grant, and any
complaint about the breach of the same, cannot be even a matter for the application for the grant of
a writ, direction or order under Art. 226 of the Constitution, much less under Art.32. These
contentions plausible though it may seem at first blush, are, on closer scrutiny, nor well-founded.
mey ignore the true object and purpose for which the grant was made, namely, for the construction
of a building or installation of a printing press for publication of a newspaper and the direct and
immediate effect of the impugned notices for re-entry upon forfeiture of lease and the threatened
demolition of the Express Buildings built on the leasehold premises under c1.5 of the lease-deed for
alleged breach of cls. 2(5) and 2(14) thereof and under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 when the said buildings had been constructed with the permission of the
lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing, and in conformity with the Master Plan
and the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area as well as with the sanction of the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi and therefore must amount to a violation of the freedom of speech and
expression enshrined in Art. 19(1)(a). I am not impressed at all with the submissions of learned
counsel for respondent no.1 that the forfeiture of lease or the threatened demolition of the Express
Buildings does not touch upon the right guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) as the petitioners can still
shift the printing press to an alternative accommodation.

It is argued by learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that the main thrust of the impugned
notice of re-entery dated March 10, 1980 by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office
purporting to act on bahalf of the lessor, the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing under cl.5
of the indenture of lease dated March 17, 1958 requiring the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show
cause why the Union of India should not re-enter upon and take possession of plots nos. 9 and 10,
Bahadurshah Zafar Marg together with the Express Buildings built thereon for alleged breach of cls.
2(5) and 2(14) of the lease-deed and that of the earlier notice dated March 1, 1980 issued by the
Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal Corporation, Delhi requiring them to show cause
why the aforesaid buildings should not be demolished under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 was a direct threat on the freedom of the press guaranteed under Art.19(1)(a)
of the Constitution. He contends that the impugned notices were intended and meant to bring about
a closure of the Indian Express and not so much for the professed enforcement of laws governing
building regulations the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the Master Plan for Delhi and the Zonal
Development Plan for D-II area for the Muthura Road Commercial Complex framed thereunder or
the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 and the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Building)
Bye-laws, 1959. He further contends that the respondents cannot be permitted to traverse beyond

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 65Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

the pleadings of the parties as contained in the counter affidavit of respondent no.2 filed on behalf of
the respondents and the supplementary affidavit of M.K. Mukherjee, Secretary, Ministry of Works &
Housing, or the terms of the impugned notices. In an attempt to justify the illegal, arbitrary and
irrational governmental and statutory action which was wholly mala fide and politically motivated,
he particularly drew our attention to the terms of the impugned notice issued by the Engineer
Officer, Land & Development Office dated March 10, 1980 which purport to forfeit the lease under
cl.5 of the lease-deed. On two grounds, namely: (1) The additional construction of the new Express
Building by Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. on the western portion of plots nos. 9 and 10 i.e. the land
to be kept open as 'green', was without taking permission of the lessor under the terms of the
lease-deed. And (2) The building plans were not submitted for sanction of the lessor under the terms
of the lease and thus there was contravention of cls. 2(5) and 2(14) of the lease-deed. He also
pointed out that the impugned notice of the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal
Corporation, Delhi dated March 1, 1980 was on the ground that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
had started unauthorized construction of excess basement beyond sanction and construction of
upper basement without sanction as shown in red in the sketch plan annexed thereto and that these
were therefore unauthorized constructions liable to be demolished under ss. 343 and 344 of the
Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. According to the learned counsel, the impugned notices
were based on grounds which were factually incorrect.

Learned counsel further pointed out that the impugned notice of the Engineer Officer nowhere
suggests that the construction of the said building with an increased FAR of 360 was in breach of the
Master Plan or the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area framed under the Delhi Development Act
or of the Building Bye-laws made under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. The contention
is that the said building with an increased FAR of 360 together with a double basement for
installation of a printing press for the publication of a Hindi newspaper was with the express
sanction of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing accorded to the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. which had duly submitted the building palns for grant of requisite sanction. In
the premises, it is submitted that each of the structures was constructed with the express sanction of
the lessor, and the Delhi Development Authority granted under the Delhi Development Act, 1957
which was the paramount law on the subject. It is urged that the re-entry upon forfeiture of lease or
the threatened demolition of the new Express Building with the double basement where the printing
press is installed for publication of the Hindi newspaper Jansatta will result in snuffing out the
Indian Express as a newspaper altogether although it has the largest combined net sales among all
daily newspapers in India. The learned counsel particularly emphasized the fact that the Express
Buildings at 9-10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg from the nerve- centre of the Express Group of
Newspapers in general and the Indian Express in particular as the teleprinter is installed therein.
We are informed that the editorials and the leading articles of the Indian Express are sent out and
the editorial policy laid down from the Delhi office to ten centres all over India. As already stated,
the Indian Express as a newspaper is simultaneously published from Ahmedabad, Bangalore,
Bombay, Chandigarh, Cochin, Delhi, Hyderabad, Madras, Madurai, Vijaywada and Vizianagaram. In
this factual background, the learned counsel contends that the impugned notices have a direct
impact on the freedom of the press and being in excess of governmental authority and colourable
exercise of statutory powers, are liable to be struck down as offending Art. 19(1)(a) read with Art. 14
of the Constitution. He contends that the test laid down by this Court in Bannett Coleman & Co. &

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 66Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. [1973] 2 S.C.R. 757, is whether the direct and immediate impact of the
impugned action is on the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) which
includes the freedom of the press. According to him, that test is clearly fulfilled in the facts and
circumstances of the present case. In my considered view, the contention of the learned counsel for
the petitioners must prevail.

I regret my inability to accept the contention to the contrary advanced by learned counsel appearing
for respondent no.1 indicated above that the petitioners are seeking to enforce a contractual right
and therefore the questions raised cannot be decided on a petition under Art.32 of the Constitution.
It is urged that the content of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution
demarcate the area within which the jurisdiction of the Court under Art. 32 can operate and that it is
not permissible for the Court to enlarge upon its jurisdiction by a process of judicial interpretation.
Placing reliance on certain observations of Ayyangar, J. in All India Bank Employees' Association v.
National Industrial Tribunal & Ors. [1962] 3 S.C.R. 269, and of Chandrachud and Bhagwati, JJ. in
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [1978] 2 S.C.R. 621, it is urged that the content of Art. 19(1)(a) of
the Constitution would not include the right which is guaranteed by other clauses of Art.19.
According to the learned counsel it must therefore logically follow that what facilitated the exercise
of a fundamental right did not for that reason become a part of the fundamental right itself. He read
out different passages from the judgments of Bhagwati, J. in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu &
Anr., [1974] 2 S.C.R. 348, Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (supra) and Ramana Dayaram Shetty v.
International Airport Authority of India Ltd. & Ors., [1979] 3 S.C.R. 1014, and endeavoured to show,
to use his own language, that "inspite of some literal flourish in the language here and there, they
did not and could not depart from the ambit of Art. 14 which deals with the principle of equality
embodied in the Article". He was particularly critical of the dectum of Bhagwati, J. in International
Airport Authority's case that "arbitrariness was the anti thesis of Art. 14" and commented that this
would mean that all governmental actions which are not supportable by law were per se violative of
Art. 14. Iam afraid, it is rather late in the day to question the correctness of the landmark decision in
Maneka Gandhi's case and the innovative construction placed by Bhagwati, J. on Art. 14 in the three
cases of Royappa, Maneka Gandhi and International Airport Authority (supra), which have evolved
new dimensions in judicial process.

It is also urged that the argument of learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners that the
building in question is necessary for running the press and any statutory or executive action to pull
it down or forfeit the lease would directly impinge on the right of freedom of speech and expression
under Art. 19(1)(a) is wholly misconceived inasmuch as every activity that may be necessary for
exercise of freedom of speech and expression or that may facilitate such exercise or make it
meaningful and effective cannot be elevated to the status of a fundamental right as if it were part of
the fundamental right to free speech and expression. It is further urged that the right to the land and
the right to construct buildings thereon for running a printing press are not derived from Art.
19(1)(a) but spring from the terms of the grant of such lands by the Government under the
provisions of the Government Grants Act, 1895 and regulated by other laws governing the subject
viz. the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the Master Plan and the Zonal Development Plans framed
thereunder, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, and the Delhi Municipal Corporation
(Building) Bye-laws, 1959 which regulate construction of buildings in the Union Territory of Delhi

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 67Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

irrespective of the purpose for which the building is constructed. It is also urged that even on a
question of fact, the direct impact of the impugned notices will not be on the double basement
wherein printing press is installed but will be wholly or in part on the two upper storeys which are
not intended to be used in relation to the press or for publication of the intended Hindi Newspaper
but only for the purpose of letting out the same for profit; the only other possible effect may be the
removal of the upper basement which the petitioners call a working platform which has been
constructed in violation of the building regulations.

Learned counsel for respondent no.1, the Union of India accepts that the right to carry on the
business of printing and publication of a newspaper and installation of a printing press for that
purpose is undoubtedly a fundamental right guaranteed both under Arts. 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) but
the right to occupy the land or construct suitable structures thereon for the business of a printing
press on such land is not within Art. 19(1)(a) nor within Art. 19(1)(g). If it were, the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act or the Delhi Development Act, and the Master Plan or the Zonal Development Plan
and the Building Bye-laws would be totally ineffectual. Such restrictions cannot be placed even
though in the interest of the general public as they would not fall within Art.19(2). If, in respect of
the building in question, the right to occupy such land is to be considered as comprehended in the
right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art.19(1)(a), then inevitable consequence
would be that neither the provisions of the Delhi Development Act nor the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act nor the Master Plan or the Zonal Development Plans or the Building Bye-laws
would be applicable so as to control the building activities of the petitioners. It is said that the
irresistible conclusion, therefore, ought to be that the fundamental right of freedom of speech and
expression of a person under Art.19(1)(a) cannot extend to the continued occupation of a place
where such right is derived from a grant or contract. Such a right is certainly not within the content
of Art.19(1)(a) or Art. 19(1)(g). It is accordingly argued that the right arising out of a statute or out of
a contract cannot be a fundamental right itself. Once contract is entered into or a grant is made, the
rights and obligations of the parties are not governed by Part III of the Constitution, by the terms of
the document embodying the contract or the grant, and any complaint about the breach of the same,
cannot be even a matter for application for grant of a writ, direction or order under Art. 226 of the
Constitution much less under Art. 32. In substance, the submission is that the right to run a press
may be a fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) or Art.

19(1)(g) but the right to use a particular building for running a press is altogether another thing
inasmuch as no particular building is equally fit for the running of the press and the person desiring
to run a press or already running the press is at liberty to acquire another suitable building for that
purpose. Further, even if the buildings in question were necessary for the enjoyment of the rights
under Art. 19(1)(a) or Art.19(1)(g), a right to use a particular building does not become an ' integral
part of the right to freedom of speech and expression’ or the 'right to carry on any trade or business
in printing and publishing a newspaper’ and clearly therefore the petitions under Art. 32 were not
maintainable. I am afraid, the contentions are wholly misconceived and cannot be accepted.

Here, the very threat is to the existence of a free and independent press. It is now firmly established
by a series of decisions of this Court and is a rule written into the Constitution that freedom of the

press is comprehended within the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 68Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

19(1)(a) and I do not wish to traverse the familiar ground over again except to touch upon certain
landmark decisions. In Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras,[1950] S.C.R. 594, the Court observed
that the Founding Fathers realized that freedoms of speech and of the press are at the foundation of
all democratic organizations, for without free political discussion no public education, so essential
for proper functioning of the processes of popular Government, is possible. In Sakal Papers (P) Ltd.
v. Union of India,[1962] 3 S.C.R. 842, the Court reiterated :

"That the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) of the
Constitution includes the freedom of press i.e. the freedom of propagation of ideas,
and that freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation. Liberty of circulation is as
essential to that freedom as the liberty of publication. Central to the concept of a free
press is freedom of political opinion and at the core of that freedom lies the right to
criticise the Government, because it is only through free debate and free exchange of
ideas that Government remains representation to the will of the people and orderly
change is effected. When avenues of political expression are closed, Government by
consent of the governed would soon be foreclosed. Such freedom is the foundation of
free Government of a free people. Our Government set up being elected limited and
responsible we need requisite freedom of any animadversion for our social interest
which ordinarily demands free propagation of views. Freedom to think as one likes
and to speak as one thinks are as a rule indispensable to the discovery and separate of
truth and without free speech, discussion may be futile."

Romesh Thappar's case was cited with approval in Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of
India & Ors. [1959] S.C.R. 12@ 120. There is in the Express Newspapers’ case an elaborate
discussion of the freedom of the press at pp. 118-128 of the Report. The Express Newspapers’ case
and also the case of Sakal Papers were cited with approval by the Court in Bennett Coleman. The
principle is too well- settled to need any more elaboration.

I would only like to stress that the freedom of thought and expression, and the freedom of the press
are not only valuable freedoms in themselves but are basic to a democratic form of Government
which proceeds on the theory that problems of the Government can be solved by the free exchange
of thought and by public discussion of the various issues facing the nation. It is necessary to
emphasize and one must not forget that the vital importance of freedom of speech and expression
involves the freedom to dissent to a free democracy like ours. Democracy relies on the freedom of
the press. It is the inalienable right of everyone to comment freely upon any matter of public
importance. This right is one of the pillars of individual liberty-freedom of speech, which our Court
has always unfailingly guarded. I wish to add that however precious and cherished the freedom of
speech is under Art.19(1)(a), this freedom is not absolute and unlimited at all times and under all
circumstances but is subject to the restrictions contained in Art. 19(2). That must be so because
unrestricted freedom of speech and expression which includes the freedom of the press and is
wholly free from restraints, amounts to uncontrolled licence which would lead to disorder and
anarchy and it would be hazardous to ignore the vital importance of our social and national interest
in public order and security of the State.

In Bennett Coleman's case the Court indicated that the extent of permissible limitations on this
freedom are indicated by the fundamental law of the land itself viz. Art. 19(2) of the Constitution. It
was laid down that permissible restrictions on any fundamental right guaranteed under Part III of
the Constitution have to be imposed by a duly enacted law and must not be excessive i.e. they must
not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the object of the law under which they are sought to be
imposed. The power to impose restrictions on fundamental rights is essentially a power to 'regulate’
the exercise of those rights. In fact, 'regulation' and not extinction of that which is to be regulated is,
generally speaking, the extent to which permissible restrictions may go in order to satisfy the test of
reasonableness." The Court also dealt with the extent of permissible limitations on the freedom of
speech and expression guaranteed under Art.19(1)(a). The test laid down by the Court in Bennett
coleman's case is whether the direct and immediate impact of the impugned action is on the
freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) which includes the freedom of the
press. It was observed that the restriction on the number of pages, a restraint on circulation and a
restraint on advertizements would affect the fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a) on the aspects of
propagation, publication and circulation of a newspaper. In repelling the contention of the learned
Additional Solicitor-General that the newsprint policy did not violated Art. 19(1)(a) as it does not
direct and immediately deal with the right mentioned in Art. 19(1)(a), the Court held that the test of
pith and substance of the subject-matter and of direct and incidental effect of legislation are relevant
to questions of legislative competence but they are irrelevant to the question of infringement of
fundamental rights. The true test, according to the Court, is whether the effect of the impugned
action is to take away or abridge fundamental rights. It was stated that the word ‘direct’ would go to
the quality or character of the effect and not the subject matter and the restriction sought to be
imposed by the impugned newsprint policy was, in substance, a newspaper control i.e. to control the
number of pages or circulation of dailies or newspapers and such restrictions were clearly outside
the ambit of Art. 19(2) of the Constitution and therefore were in abridgement of the right of freedom
of speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a), and it added :

"The Newsprint Control Policy is found to be newspaper control order in the guise of
framing an Import Control Policy for newsprint. This Court in the Bank
Nationalisation case (supra) laid down two tests. First it is not the object of the
authority making the law impairing the right of the citizen nor the form of action that
determines the invasion of the right. Secondly, it is the effect of the law and the action
upon the right which attracts the jurisdiction of the court to grant relief. The direct
operation of the Act upon the rights forms the real test.

...No law or action would state in words that rights of freedom of speech and
expression are abridged or taken away. That is why Courts have to protect and guard
fundamental rights by considering the scope and provisions of the Act and its effect
upon the fundamental rights."

We have only to substitute the word 'executive' for the word ‘law’ and the result is obvious. Here, the
impugned notices of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease and of the threatened demolition of the
Express Buildings are intended and meant to silence the voice of the Indian Express. It must
logically follow that the impugned notices constitute a direct and immediate threat to the freedom of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 70Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

the press and are thus violative of Art. 19(1)(a) read with Art.14 of the Constitution. It must
accordingly be held that these petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution are maintainable.

The Government Grants Act, 1895 : Section 3: Purport & Effect of: Whether the notice of re- entry
upon forfeiture of lease was valid and enforceable due to non-compliance of clause 6 thereof.

It is common ground that the perpetual lease was a Government grant governed by the Crown
Grants Act, 1895, now known as the Government Grants Act. The Act is an explanatory or
declaratory Act. Doubts having arisen as to the extent and operation of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882 and as to the power of the Government to impose limitations and restrictions upon grants and
other transfers of land made by it or under its authority, the Act was passed to remove such doubts
as is clear from the long title and the preamble. The Act contains two sections and provides by s.2
for the exclusion of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and, by s.3 for the exclusion of, any rule of
law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the contrary. Ss.2 and 3 read as follows :

"2. Transfer of Property Act, 1882, not to apply to Government grants
Nothing in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, contained shall apply or be deemed
over to have applied to any grant or other transfer of land or of any interest therein
heretofore made or hereafter to be made by or on behalf of the government to, or in
favour of, any person whomsoever; but every such grant and transfer shall be
construed and take effect as if the said Act had not been passed.”

"3. Government grants to take effect according to their tenor
All provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations over contained in any such
grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be valid and take effect according to their tenor,
any rule of law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the contrary
notwithstanding.

It is plain upon the terms that s.2 excludes the operation of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to
Government grants. While s.3 declares that all provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations
contained over any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be valid and shall take effect according
to their tenor, notwithstanding any rule of law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the
contrary. A series of judicial decisions have determined the overriding effect of s.3 making it amply
clear that a grant of property by the Government partakes of the nature of law since it overrides even
legal provisions which are contrary to the tenor of the document.

Learned counsel appearing for respondent no.1, the Union of India, fairly conceded that the
impugned notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease dated March 10, 1980 issued by the Engineer
Officer, L&DO purporting to be on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of India under cl.5 of the
indenture of lease dated March 17, 1958 was invalid and had no legal effect since there was
non-compliance of the mandatory requirements of c1.6 thereof. But as a very astute counsel he
sought to evolve an argument contrary to the stand taken in the counter-affidavit filed by

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 71Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

respondent no.2 on behalf of all the respondents and the supplementary affidavit of M.K.
Mukherjee, Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing that the 'breach was irremediable' and therefore
the lessor i.e. the Union of India acting through the Land & Development Officer (L&DO) was
entitled to serve a notice under c1.5 for re-entry upon forfeiture of lease. He contended that the
impugned notice was, in reality, not a notice of forfeiture under c1.5 of the lease-deed but it was
merely of an exploratory nature to afford petitioner no.1 Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to have its
say before the L&DO as to whether the construction of the new Express Building with an increased
FAR of 360 was in violation of the Master Plan or the Zonal Development Plans or the building
bye-laws i.e. contrary to the terms of the lease, and that it was for the L&DO to be satisfied as to
whether there was a breach of the terms of cls. 2(14) and 2(5) of the lease and that in the event of his
reaching that conclusion, to proceed to serve the lessee with a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of
lease under c1.5 learned counsel appearing for respondent no.5 L&DO has placed before us a
detailed note explaining the prevailing practice followed by the L&DO in such case. The meaning
and significance of the note is that the show cause notice under c1.5 served by the L&DO is merely a
preliminary step affording the lessee an opportunity to settle the terms and conditions with the
concurrence of the Ministry of Works & Housing, offered by the lessor for condonation of such
breach. In the event the lessee fails to comply with such terms the L&DO withdraws the terms
offered and then calls upon the lessee to remove or remedy the misuse or breach within 30 days. If
there is failure on the part of the lessee to remedy such breach within the time allowed, the L&DO
processes the case for exercise by the lessor i.e. the Union of India of its rights to re-enter upon
forfeiture of lease under c1. 5 of the lease-deed. It is said that according to the prevailing practice in
respect of such leases i.e. pre 1959 leases of the kind held by petitioner no.1 Express Newspapers
Pvt. Ltd., the approval of the Lt. Governor is considered a condition precedent to a final order of
re-entry which is served on the lessee after such approval is accorded by the Lt. Governor. In terms
of the order of re-entry the lessee is requested to hand over possession peacefully to the L&DO
within a reasonable time. However, if the lessee does not hand over possession voluntarily in
pursuance of L&DO's letter, the L&DO files an application under s. 5(1) of the Public Premises
(Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971. Under s.8 of the Act the Estate Officer has the same
powers that are vested in the Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in trying a suit in
respect of matters mentioned therein. The Estate Officer has to form an opinion that the lessee was
in unauthorized occupation of any public premises and that he should be evicted whereupon the
Estate Officer issues a notice under s.4 by calling upon all persons concerned to show cause why an
order of eviction should not be passed. Under s.9 of the Act the person aggrieved has the remedy of
an appeal to the District Judge and thereafter he may move the High Court under Art. 226 of the
Constitution.

Iam not at all impressed by any of these submissions advanced on behalf of the respondents. There
can be no doubt whatever on a true construction of the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 that
the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office purporting to act on behalf of the lessor i.e. the
Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing served a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease
under c1.5 of the lease-deed. There was no question of the said notice being construed to be of an
exploratory nature. The note prepared by the L&DO is nothing but an afterthought. In the view that
I take that respondent no.2 is not the successor of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi nor has any
function in relation to the lease. There is no warrant for the suggestion that prior approval of the Lt.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 72Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Governor is a condition precedent to the right of the lessor i.e. the Union of India to exercise its right
to re-entry upon forfeiture of lease under c1.5 of the lease-deed.

There are two decisions of this Court which appear to be contradictory. In Bishan Das & Ors. v. State
of Punjab & Ors. [1962] 2 S.C.R. 69, a Constitution Bench of this Court speaking through S.K. DAs,
J. in somewhat similar circumstances allowed the petition under Art.32 of the Constitution directing
restoration of possession to the lessee who had been dispossessed from land granted by the
Government by display of force. What had happened was this. One Ramjidas built a dharamsala, a
temple and shops appurtenant thereto with the joint family funds on Government land with the
permission of the Government. After his death the other members of the family who were in
management and possession of those properties were dispossessed by the State Government of
Punjab at the instigation of a member of the ruling Congress party. The petitioners applied to the
Punjab High Court for issue of appropriate writs under Art. 226 of the Constitution but the petition
was dismissed in limine on the preliminary ground that the matter involved disputed questions of
fact. An appeal under c1.10 of the Letters Patent was also dismissed on the same ground. The
petitioners then moved this Court under Art.32. The State Government sought to justify the action
on the ground that the petitioners were merely trespassers as the land on which the dharamsala
stood belonged to the State, and the respondents were entitled to use the minimum of force to eject
the trespassers. It was also contended that there was a serious dispute on questions of fact between
the parties and also whether the petitioners had any right or title to the subject matter in dispute
and therefore proceedings by way of a writ were not appropriate in the case inasmuch as the
decision of the court would amount to a decree declaring a party's title and ordering restoration of
possession. The Court repelled both the contentions as unsound and held that the petitioners had
made out a clear case of violation of their fundamental rights. As to the contention that the
petitioners were mere trespassers, the Court held that the admitted position was that the land
belonged to the State; with the permission of the State, Ramjidas on behalf of the joint family firm of
Faquir Chand Bhagwan Das built the dharamsala, temple and shops and managed the same during
his lifetime. After his death the petitioners, other members of the joint family continued in
possession and management. On this admitted position, it was held that the petitioners could not be
held to be mere trespassers in respect of the dharamsala, temple and shops; nor could it be held that
the dharamsala, temple and shops belonged to the State irrespective of the question whether V the
trust created was of a public or private nature, and it was observed :

"It is, therefore, impossible to hold that in respect of the dharamsala, temples and
shops, the State has acquired any rights whatsoever merely by reason of their being
on the land belonging to the State. If the State thought that the constructions should
be removed or that the condition as to resumption of the land should be invoked, it
was open to the State to take appropriate legal action for the purpose."

As to the second contention, the Court observed :
"It was enough to say that they are bona fide in possession of the constructions in
question and could not be removed except under authority of law. The respondents

clearly violated their fundamental rights by depriving them of possession of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 73Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

dharamsala by executive orders.

The Court accordingly quashed the orders and issued a writ of mandamus directing restoration of
the property. The Court felt its duty to pass strictures against the Government :

"We feel it our duty to say that the executive action taken in this case by the State and
its officers is destructive of the basic principle of the rule of law.

The facts and the position in law thus clearly are (1) that the buildings constructed on
this piece of Government land did not belong to Government, (2) that the petitioners
were in possession and occupation of the buildings and (3) that by the virtue of
enactments binding on the Government, the petitioners could be dispossessed, if at
all, only in pursuance of a decree of a Civil Court, obtained in proceedings properly
initiated. In these circumstances the action of the Government in taking the law into
their hands and dispossessing the petitioners by the display of forced exhibits a
callous disregard of the normal requirements of the rule of law apart from what
might legitimately and reasonably be expected from a Government functioning in a
society governed by a Constitution which guarantees to its citizens against arbitrary
invasion of the executive of peaceful possession of property.

The Court also adverted to the earlier decision in Wazir Chand v. State of H.P., [1955] 1S.C.R. 408,
where it was held that the State or its executive officers cannot interfere with the rights of others
unless they can point to some specific rule of law which authorises their acts, and to Ram Prasad
Narayan Sahi v. State of Bihar, [1953] S.C.R. 1129, where the Court said that nothing is more likely
to drain the vitality from the rule of law than legislation which singles out a particular individual
from his fellow subjects and visits him with a disability which is not imposed upon the others, and
concluded :

"We have here a highly discriminatory and autocratic act which deprives a person of
the possession of property without reference to any law or legal authority. Even if the
property was trust property it is difficult to see how the Municipal Committee,
Barnala, can step in as trustee on an executive determination only. The reasons given
for this extraordinary action are, to quote what we said in Sahi's case (supra),
remarkable for their disturbing implications.

In the later case of State of Orissa v. Ram Chandra Dev, A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 685, Gajendragadkar, J.
delivering the judgment of the Constitution Bench observed :

"Oridinarily, where property has been granted by the State on condition which make
the grant resumable, after resumption it is the grantee who moves the Court for
appropriate relief, and that proceeds on the basis that the grantor State which has
reserved to itself the right to resume may, after exercising its right, seek to recover
possession of the property without filing a suit."

All that the Court laid down was that the existence of a right is the foundation for a petition under
Art. 226 of the Constitution. In that case, certain ex-zamindars of Ganjam district were holding
Government Lands appurtenant to their office as Muthadars and were dispossessed therefrom upon
resumption of their Muthas. The Court held that the lands were held by the ex-zamindars as service
tenures which were resumable at the will of the Government. The parties were at issue on the
question about the character of the grant under which the predecessors of the ex-zamindars were
originally granted the lands in question. The Orissa High Court held that it was not possible for it to
decide the important question of title involved in proceedings under Art. 226 but that such a kind of
title could only be decided in a properly constituted suit but nevertheless were inclined to the view
that the right to recover possession vesting in a person who had been in possession prior to such
dispossession which was implicit in 8.9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 would be enforced by a
petition under Art.

226. The view of the High Court was-obviously not sustainable. At the hearing, counsel for the
respondents sought an adjournment on the ground that the respondents had in the meanwhile filed
a suit against the State Government and further that the parties were negotiating for a settlement. It
appears that the court rejected the prayer for adjournment saying that useful purpose would be
served by granting any further time and thereafter entered upon the merits. lt held that merely
because a suit under 8. 9 of the Specific Relief Act would have been competent, no right can be
claimed by the respondents merely on the ground of their possession under Art. 226 unless their
right to remain in possession was established against the State Government. There is no reference to
the earlier decision of the Constitution Bench in Bishan Das' case nor does the judgment lay down
any contrary principle. It seems to me that the observations of Gajendragadkar, J. were merely in
the nature of obiter in Ramchandra Dev's case and nothing really turns on the observations made by
him. The decision in Ramchandra Dev's case appears to be in per incuriam.

Even in cases involving purely contractual issues, the settled law is that where statutory provisions
of public law are involved, writs will issue: Md. Hanif v. State of Assam[1970] 2 S.C.R. 197.

For the sake of completeness, I wish to clear the ground of a possible misconception. Learned
counsel appearing for respondent no.1 the Union of India while contending that the impugned
notice dated March 10, 1980 was of an exploratory nature, fairly conceded that the lessor i.e. the
Union of India must enforce its right of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease under c1.5 of the lease-deed
by recourse to due process of law and wanted to assure us that there was no question of marching
the army or making use of the demolition squad of the Delhi Development Authority or the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi in demolishing the Express Buildings. As we felt that there was
some ambiguity in the expression 'due process of law’, we wanted a categorical answer whether by
this he meant by a properly constituted suit. Without meaning any disrespect, the learned counsel
adopted an ambivalent attitude saying that the due process may not only consist in the filing of a
suit by the lessor or re-entry upon forfeiture of the lease but that in the case of lease of Government
Lands, the authorities may also take recourse to the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized
Occupants) Act, 1971. I have no doubt in my mind that the learned counsel is not right in suggestion
that the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing can in the facts and
circumstances of the case, take recourse to the summary procedure under that Act. The Express

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 75Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. having acted upon the grant of permission by the lessor i.e. the Union of India,
Ministry of Works & Housing to construct the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360
together with a double basement was clearly not an unauthorized occupant within the meaning of
s.2(g) of the Act which runs as under :

2(g) unauthorized occupation", in relation to any public premises, means the
occupation by any person of the public premises without authority for such
occupation, and includes the continuance in occupation by any person of the public
premises after the authority (whether by way of grant of any other mode of transfer)
under which he was allowed to occupy the premises has expired or has been
determined for any reason whatsoever.

The Express Buildings constructed by Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. with the sanction of the lessor
ie. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing on plots 8. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg
demised on perpetual lease by registered lease-deed dated March 17, 1958 can, by no process of
reasoning, be regarded as public premises belonging to the Central Government under 8. 2(e). That
being so, there is no question of the lessor applying for eviction of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
under s.2(1) of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 nor has the
Estate Officer any authority or jurisdiction to direct their eviction under sub-s.(2) thereof by
summary process. Due process of Law in a case like the present necessarily implies the filing of suit
by the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing for the enforcement of the alleged
right of re- entry, if any upon forfeiture of lease due to breach of the terms of the lease.

Nothing stated here should be construed to mean that the Government has not the power to take
recourse to the provisions of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971
where admittedly there 18 unauthorized construction by a lessee or by any other person on
Government Land which is public premises within the meaning of s.2(e) and such person is in
unauthorized occupation thereof.

The constitutional position of the Lieutenant Governor : Whether the Lieutenant-Governor is the
successor of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi. One of the most crucial issues on which long and
erudite arguments were advanced by learned counsel for the parties, turned on the question as to
whether the Lt. Governor was a successor of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi. Learned counsel
appearing for the petitioners contended that the Lt. Governor cannot usurp the functions of the
lease i.e. the Union of India or the Chief Commissioner of Delhi in relation to the lease in question.
It is urged that the Union Territory of Delhi which first became a Part 'C' State under the
Constitution, was an entirely new constitutional entity and therefore the office of the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi ceased to exist. It is further urged that the Lt. Governor appointed by the
President under Art. 239(1) of the Constitution is an Administrator and he discharges such
functions as are entrusted to him by the President of India and in the absence of a notification under
Art. 239(1), the Lt. Governor cannot usurp the functions of the Union of India in relation to the
properties of the Union. It is pointed out that there was no notification issued by the President of
India in terms of Art.239(1) of the Constitution empowering the Lt. Governor to administer the
properties of the Union in the Union Territory of Delhi.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 76Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Learned counsel appearing for the Union of India substantially advanced the same argument.
According to him, the Lt. Governor had no powers in relation to the properties of the Union and
therefore the Union of India is not bound by the acts of the Lt. Governor. The Lt. Governor had no
power in relation to the lease and therefore he could not usurp to himself the powers and functions
of the Union of India in relation to the lease-deed. The learned counsel went to the extent of saying
that wherever the expression 'Chief Commissioner of Delhi' appears in the lease-deed, it had to be
struck out altogether as no such office exists in view of the Constitutional changes since brought
about. That is to say, the question involved must be determined on the footing as if the parties never
contemplated the Chief commissioner of Delhi to exercise any of the functions of the lessor under
the lease-deed.

In reply, learned counsel appearing for respondent no.2, the Lt. Governor, advanced a two fold
submission; firstly, the Lt. Governor is the alter ego of the President of India and not a mere formal
or titular head of the Union Territory of Delhi, and in the connection he referred to the
constitutional history of the Union Territory of Delhi. In support of his contention that the
designation of the Administrator as the Chief Commissioner of Delhi under both the Government of
India Acts of 1919 and 1935 or as the Lt. Governor under the Constitution was a mere matter of
nomenclature, the learned counsel referred to the provisions relating to the powers, functions and
duties of the Chief Commissioner or the Lt. Governor, as the case may be, which remained the same.
In his words, the Lt. Governor is the 'eyes and ears' of the President in relation to such territory
which he is called upon to Administer on behalf of the President. One of the primary functions of the
Lt. Governor, as the Administrator, is to be aware of facts brought to his notice and therefore
respondent no.2 could not have turned a blind eye to the action of Sikandar Bakht, the then Minister
for Works & Housing in making a highly fraudulent, illegal and improper grant of permission to the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to build the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with
a direction to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to accord sanction to the building plan submitted
to them, as it had become the talk of the town. As already stated, learned counsel for respondent
no.1 while contending that the Lt. Governor, as an Administrator, had no function as the lessor or its
delegate, supported him only to the extent that as an Administrator he had to keep himself informed
of any violations of law in the Union Territory of Delhi with the administration of which he was
concerned. It was, therefore, legitimate for the Lt. Governor to have kept the authorities informed,
and though he had no independent power of his own, he could place the material gathered by him
with the lessor i.e. Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing, with a view to initiate necessary
action.

Secondly, the contention of learned counsel for respondent no.2 was that the express exclusion of
certain specific powers under the proviso to s.21 of the Government of Part 'C' States Act, 1951
relates to the legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly or the Delhi Metropolitan Council and
not to the executive functions of the Chief Commissioner or the Lt. Governor. It was submitted that
this constitutional pattern was designed on the basis of the 'transferred powers' in respect of which
the Legislative Assembly of Delhi or the Delhi Metropolitan Council were given certain defined role
but the 'reserved powers' were exercisably by the Administrator as the Chief Commissioner or the
Lt. Governor i.e. the executive functions of the President of India under Art.53 of the Constitution. It
was accordingly urged that the Legislative Assembly of Delhi did not nave the powers to make any

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 77Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

law with respect to 'land and building vested or in possession of the Union of India' relatable to
Entry 32 of List 1 of the Seventh Schedule, and the powers and functions of the Council of Ministers
in the Union Territory of Delhi as a Part 'C' State extended only to the legislative powers conferred
under s.21 of the Act. The 'reserved powers' which were excluded from the purview of the Legislative
Assembly or the Delhi Metropolitan Council were, however, exercisable by the Chief Commissioner
and necessarily by the Lt. Governor as the appointed agent or the nominee of the President. It was
submitted that the Lt. Governor continues to have certain defined functions, apart from his function
as the executive head of the Delhi Administration. As an incumbent of an important public office of
the Lt. Governor, he is intended to discharge diverse functions on behalf of the President of India as
his agent in relation to the Union Territory of Delhi. In support of his contention, reliance was
placed on the interpretation of s.2(3) and s.36 of the Act. It was urged that the office of the Land &
Development Officer was under the direct administrative control of the Chief Commissioner A as the
Administrator until 1959. The Land & Development Officer administered nazul lands at that time as
he does now. Although this was a subject excluded from the competence of the Legislative Assembly
of Delhi under the proviso to s.21 of the Act, the authority of the Chief Commissioner as the
Administrator over the Land & Development Officer and over the administration of nazul lands as a
‘reserved subject’ was kept under the administrative control of the Chief Commissioner. It was
accordingly asserted that under several leases, including the one in the instant case, the Lt.
Governor as the appointed agent or the nominee of the President is entitled to act on behalf of the
lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing and necessarily must have
administrative control over the Land & Development Office and the administration of nazul lands.

To appreciate the rival contentions, it is necessary to view the question from a historical perspective
since the Union Territory of Delhi, as it now exists, has undergone many constitutional changes.
Prior to September 17, 1912, the Territory of Delhi was known as the 'Imperial Delhi Estate' and was
included within the then Province of Punjab. After the decision to form the capital at Delhi was
reached, proceedings for acquisition of land therefore were taken by the Collector of Delhi District
pursuant to the notification no.775 dated December 21, 1911 issued by the Lt. Governor of Punjab.
When the Capital was shifted from Calcutta to Delhi, the Governor-General in-Council by his
proclamation dated September 17, 1912 took under his immediate authority and management the
territory of Delhi with the sanction and approbation of the Secretary of State for India. The Delhi
Laws Act, 1912 came into force w.e.f. September 18, 1912 and provided for the administration of the
territory of Delhi by a Chief Commissioner as a separate Province to be known as the Province of
Delhi. The Preamble to the Act reads as follows :

"Whereas by Proclamation published in Notification No.911 dated the Seventeenth
day of September, 1912 the Governor-General-in-Council, with the sanction and
approbation of the Secretary of State for India has been pleased to take under his
immediate authority and management the territory mentioned in Schedule A, which
was formerly included within the Province of Punjab, and to provide for the
administration thereof by a Chief Commissioner as a separate Province to be known
as the Province of Delhi:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 78Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the application of the Law in force in the
said territory, and for the extension of other enactments thereto: I. is hereby enacted
as follows :

Under 8.58 of the Government of India Act, 1919, Delhi remained and was administered as a Chief
Commissioner's Province. The office of Land & Development Officer came into being as a separate
organisation under the administrative control of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi. Under 8.94 of the
Government of India Act, 1935, it was provided that Delhi would continue to be a Chief
Commissioner's Province. A Chief Commissioner's Province was to be administered by the
Governor-General acting to such extent as he thought fit through a Chief Commissioner to be
appointed by him in his discretion. S. 94 of the Government of India Act, 1935 provided as follows :

"94: Chief Commissioners' Provinces :

1. The following shall be the Chief Commissioners’ Provinces, that is to say, the
heretofore existing Chief Commissioners’ Provinces of British Baluchistan, Delhi,
Ajmer-Merwara, Coorg and the Andaman and Microbe Islands, the area known as
Panth Piploda, and such other Chief Commissioners’ Provinces as may be created
under this Act. "2. Aden shall cease to be part of India. "3. A Chief Commissioner's
Province shall be administered by the Governor-General acting, to such extent as he
thinks fit, through a Chief Commissioner, to be appointed by him in his discretion.

Under s.100(4) of the Government of India Act, 1935, the Federal Legislature was empowered to
legislate in relation to Chief Commissioners' Provinces and without limitation as to subjects.

With the attainment of Dominion status on August 15, 1947 under the Indian Independence Act,
1947, the powers of the legislature of the Dominion were exercisable by the Constituent Assembly
under sub-s.(1) of s.8. The constituent Assembly was not to be subject to any limitations whatsoever
in exercising its constituent powers. Thus, the Indian Independence Act, 1947 established the
sovereign character of the Constituent Assembly Which became free from all limitations. Sub-s. (2)
of s.8 of the Act provided that except insofar as other provision law made by or in accordance with a
law made by a constituent Assembly under sub-b.(1), the governance of the Dominion was to be
carried out in accordance with the Government of India Act, 1935 and the provisions of that Act, and
all the orders in Council, rules and other instruments made thereunder. On January 5, 1950, the
Constituent Assembly enacted the Government of India (Amendment) Act, 1949 by which s.290A
was inserted in the Government of India Act, 1935 providing that the Governor-General may by
order direct that an acceding State or a group of such States shall be administered as a Chief
Commissioner's Province or as past of Governor's or Chief Commissioner's Province. These acceding
States were thus converted into Centrally administered areas and included in Part 'C' of the First
Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935. The remaining States in Part 'C' were Ajmer, Coorg
and Delhi. Under the Constitution, Delhi became a Part 'C' State. As already stated the States
specified in Part 'C' of the first Schedule were to be administered by the President under Art.239(1)
acting, to such extent as he thought fit, through a Chief Commissioner or a Lt. Governor to be
appointed by him.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 79Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Section 290A of the Government of India Act, 1935, reads as follows :

"290A. Administration of certain Acceding States as a Chief Commissioner's Province
or as part of a Governor's or Chief Commissioner's Province:
1. Where full and exclusive authority, jurisdiction and powers for and in relation to
the governance of any Indian State or of any group of such States are for the time
being exercisable by the Dominion Government, the Governor-General may by order
direct:
(a) that the State or the group of States shall be administered n all respects as if the
State or the group of states were a Chief Commissioner's Province:

(b) that the State or the group of States shall be administered in all respects as if the
State or the group of States formed a part of a Governor's or a Chief Commissioner'S
Province specified in the Order.

Provided that if any Order made under clause (b) of A this sub-section affects a
governor's Province, the Governor-General shall before making such Order ascertain
the views of the Government of that Province both with respect to the proposal to
make the order and with respect to the provisions to be inserted therein. (2) Upon the
issue of an order under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of this section, all the provisions
of this Act applicable to the Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi shall apply to the
State or the group of States in respect of which the Order is made.

(3) The Governor-General may in making an order under sub-section (1) of this
section give such supple mental, incidential and consequential directions (including
directions as to representation in the Legislature) as he may deem necessary.

(4) In this section, reference to a State shall include reference to a part of a State.
As a result of this, the then Province of Delhi became a Part 'C' State.

Under the Constitution of India, Delhi became a Part 'C' State w.e.f. January 26, 1950 and it was
provided by Art.239 (1) that a State specified in Part 'C' of the First Schedule shall be administered
by the President acting to such extent as he thinks fit through a Chief commissioner or Lt. Governor
to be appointed by him. Art.239(1? of the Constitution as it then stood, insofar as material,
provided:

"239(1). Subject to the other provisions of this Part, a State specified in Part of the
First Schedule shall be administered by the Pres dent acting, to such extent as he
thinks fit, through a Chief Commissioner or a Lieutenant-Governor to be appointed
by him or through the Government of a neighbouring State: It would appear that
Art.239(1) of the Constitution differed from the provision contained in s.94(3) of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 80Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Government of India Act, 1935 to the extent that the appointment of a Chief
Commissioner or Lt.

Governor as an Administrator irrespective of The designation and entrustment of powers, functions
and duties to him by the President, were not to be in his discretion but had to be exercised on the
advice of the Council of Ministers, Except for this, 8.94(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 and
Art. 239(1) of the Constitution as enacted were identical in respect of the provisions for the
administration of Delhi as a Chief Commissioner's province under the 1935 Act and as a Part State
under the Constitution, by the Governor-General under s.94(3) and under Art.239(1) by the
President acting to such extent as he thought fit, through the Chief Commissioner or the Lt.
Governor as an Administrator irrespective of the designation.

On April 16, 1950 the Part States Laws Act, 1950 was brought into force. By s.2, the Central
Government was empowered by notification in the official gazette to extend to the State of Delhi or
to any part of such territory with such restrictions and modifications as it thought fit any enactment
which was in force in any State at the date of the notification. S.4 of the Act repealed s.7 of the Delhi
Laws Act, 1912. The Government of Part States Act, 1951 enacted by Parliament was brought into
force on September 6, 1951. S. 21 of the Act, insofar as material, read as follows :

21. Extent of Legislative Power (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Legislative
Assembly of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State with respect
to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List.:

Provided that the Legislative Assembly of the State of Delhi shall not have power to
make laws with respect to any of the following matters, namely :
(a) KEKKEKEEKER

(b) KEEKKEREKRE

(c) *********** (D) lands and buildings vested in or in the possession of the Union which are
situated in Delhi or in New Delhi including all rights in or over such lands and buildings, the
collection of rents, therefrom and the transfer and alienation thereof ;

(2) Nothing in sub-s.(1) shall derogate from the power conferred on Parliament by
the Constitution to make laws with respect to any matter for a State or any part
thereof.

Art. 239(1) of the Constitution was amended by the Constitution (7th Amendment) Act, 1956 w.e.f.
November 1, 1956 and it now reads :

"239. Administration of Union Territories - "(1) Save as otherwise provided by
Parliament by law, every Union Territory shall be administered by the President

acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through an administrator to be appointed by

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 81Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

him with such designation as he may specify.

It would be seen that for the words 'through a Chief Commissioner or a Lt. Governor to be appointed
by him' in Art. 239(1) as originally enacted, the worts substituted are 'through an administrator
appointed by him with such designation as he may specify’. One thing is clear that the Administrator
appointed by the President under Art.239(1) whether with the designation of the Chief
Commissioner or of the Lt. Governor could exercise only such powers, functions and duties as were
entrusted to him by the President i.e. there have to be specific entrustment of powers by the
President under Art. 239(1). Under Art. 246(4) of the Constitution which corresponds to s.100(4) of
the Government of India Act, 1935, Parliament was given power to make laws with respect to any
part of the territory of India not included in Part A or Part of the First Schedule, notwithstanding
that such matter was a matter enumerated in the State List.

As from the appointed day i.e. from November 1, 1956 Part States ceased to exist by virtue of the
Seventh Amendment and in their place Union Territories were substituted in the First Schedule to
the Constitution, including the Union Territory of Delhi i.e. the territories which immediately before
the commencement of the Constitution were comprised in the Chief Commissioner's Province of
Delhi. By the Seventh Amendment, Art. 246(4) was also amended. Art. 246(4), as amended, now
reads :

"246(4) - Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part
of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a
matter enumerated in the State List.

In pursuance of Art.239 as amended by the Seventh Amendment, the A President of India issued the
following notification on November 1, 1956 :

THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINARY PART 11 Section 3 PUBLISHED BY
AUTHORITY No. 332 NEW DELHI, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1956 MINISTRY
OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTIFICATION New Delhi-2, the 1st November, 1956. S.R.O.
2536 - In pursuance of clause (1) of Article 239 of the Constitution as amended by the
Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 and all other powers enabling him in
this behalf, the President hereby directs as follows :- Where, by virtue of any order
made in pursuance of Article 239 or as the case may be, Article 243 of the
Constitution as in force immediately before the 1st day of November, 1956 or any
other power under the Constitution, any powers and functions were immediately
before that day, the powers and functions

(a) the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Himachal
(b)the Chief Commissioner of the State of Delhi, Manipur or Tripura and

(c) the Chief Commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, such powers and

by
(i) the Lieutenant Governor of the Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh,
(ii) the Chief Commissioner of the Union Territory of Delhi, Manipur or Tripura, and

(iii) the Chief commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Island, subject to the like
control by the President, as were exercisable by him before the said day over the
Lieutenant Governor or as the case may be, the Chief Commissioner referred to in
clause (a),(b) or (c).

(No.F.19/22/56-SRI) HARI SHARMA. JT. Secy.

ON the same day, by Section 130 of the States Reorganization Act, 1956, the Government of Part
States Act, 1951 stood repealed. On October 1, 1959 decision was taken by the Government of India
to transfer the administrative control of the office of Land & Development Officer, New Delhi from
the Delhi Administration to Ministry of Works, Housing & Supply w.e.f. October 1, 1959. This
decision was duly communicated to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi and to the Land &
Development Officer, New Delhi. In the further affidavit of M.K. Mukherjee, Secretary, Ministry of
Works & Housing, it is averred in paragraph 6 that the 'office of the Land & Development Officer
was transferred to the control, of the Ministry of Works, Housing & Supply w.e.f. October 1, 1959
and since then it has been functioning as a subordinate office of the Ministry of works, Housing’. It
would therefore, be manifest that after October 1, 1959 neither the Chief Commissioner nor the Lt.
Governor had anything to do with the office of the Land Development Officer or the administration
of nazul lands in The Union Territory of Delhi.

The President of India on February 1, 1966 issued an order under Art.299(1) of the Constitution
which inter alia directed that in the cafe of Land & Development Office (1) all contracts and
assurances of property relating to matters falling within the jurisdiction of Land & Development
Officer, (2) all contracts, deeds and other instruments relating to and for the purpose of
enforcement of the terms and conditions of the sale/lease-deed of the government property in
Delhi/New Delhi, etc. made in exercise of the executive power of the Union may be executed on his
behalf by the Land & Development Officer. Under Clause XLI it was specifically provided :

"Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained any contract or assurance of
property relating to any matter whatsoever may be executed by the Secretary or the
Special Secretary or the Additional Secretary or the Joint Secretary or the Director, or
when there is no Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary to the Government in the
appropriate Ministry or Department.

It is pertinent to observe that neither the Chief Commissioner of Delhi nor the Lt. Governor has
been conferred any authority by the President under Art.299(1) to enter into any contract mate in
the exercise of the executive power of the Union or to act 'on behalf of' the President in relation to
such contract or assurance of property i.e. to act on behalf of the President for the enforcement of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 83Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

the terms ant conditions thereof.

On September 7, 1966 the Administrator appointed by the President in relation to the Union
Territory of Delhi who hithertofore had been designated as the Chief Commissioner was
re-designated as the Lt. Governor of Delhi. Accordingly, the President on September 7, 1966 issued
another order in terms of Art. 239(1) of the Constitution which provides as follows :

MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIR NOTIFICATION New Delhi, the 7th Sept., 1966.

8.0. 2709 - In pursuance of clause (1) of article 239 of the Constitution and all other
powers enabling him in this behalf, the President hereby directs as follows Where by
virtue of-any order made in pursuance of article 239 any powers and functions were,
immediately before the 7th September, 1966 the powers and functions of the Chief
Commissioner of the Union Territory of Delhi, such powers and functions shall, on
and after the said day, be exercised and discharged by the Lt. Governor of the Union
Territory of Delhi, subject to the like control by the President, as was exercisable by
him before the said day over the Chief Commissioner
(No.41/2/66-Delhi.) HARI SHARMA, SECRETARY The crux of the matter is whether
the Lt. Governor was by virtue of the aforesaid notification dated September 7, 1966
issued by the President, conferred any power, function and duty in relation 'o the
property of the Union in the Union Territory of Delhi. Much stress is laid by learned
counsel appearing for respondent No.2 on the said notification insofar as it provides
that the Lt. Governor shall have the same powers and functions as were exercisable
by the Chief Commissioner. That would be so provided there was a notification by the
President of India under Art. 239(1) of the Constitution vesting the Chief
Commissioner with power to administer the property of the Union of India. There is
admittedly no such notification under Art. 239(1) by the President vesting Chief
Commissioner or the Lt. Governor with any such power.

It is sought to be impressed upon us that the designation of the Administrator of a Union Territory
was per se of no particular legal or functional significance. It is argued by learned counsel appearing
for respondent no.2 that the Administrator appointed by the President under Art. 239(1), as
amended by the Seventh Amendment, could be called by any designation, that the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi continued to be the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi under Art.
239(1) after November 1, 1956 when the Government of Part States Act, 1951 was repealed by s. 130
of the States Reorganization Act, 1956 and that he functioned as such till September 6, 1966 since
the Delhi Administration Act, 1966 continued to use the nomenclature of Administrator appointed
by the President under Art. 239(1). It was for the first time on September 7, 1966 that the
Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi who used to be designated as the Chief Commissioner
was re-designated as the Lt. Governor. The learned counsel relied upon s. 18 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897 which runs as under :

18. Successors.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 84Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

1. In any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, it shall
be sufficient for the purpose of indicating the relation of a law to the successors of
any functionaries or of corporations having perpetual succession to express its
relation to the functionaries or corporations.

2. This section applies also to all Central Acts made after the third day of January,
1868, and to all Regulations made on or after the fourteenth day of January, 1887.

Our attention was drawn by the learned counsel to the decision of Mohd. Maqbool Damanoo v. State
of Jammu & kashmir, [1972] 2 S.C.R. 1014, where a Constitutional Bench held that under 8. 26(2) of
the Jammu & Kashmir Constitution, as amended, even though the Governor of Jammu & Kashmir
was not elected as the Sadar-i-Riyasat but the mode of appointment would not make a Governor
anytheless a successor to the Sadar-i-Riyasat because both were the head of the State and therefore
the executive power of the State vested in them both. In that connection, the Court referred to 8.18
of the General Clauses Act and held that the Governor being a successor of the office of the Sadar-iRiyasat was entitled to exercise all the powers and functions of the Sadar-i-Riyasat. We do not see
the relevance of the decision in Mohd. Maqbool's case to the question before us since the Lt.
Governor of Delhi is neither the successor of the Chief Commissioner nor can s.18 of the General
Clauses Act override the constitutional requirements of Art.239(1) laying down that the Lt. Governor
shall exercise only such powers as are entrusted to him by the President.

The question still remains whether the Lt. Governor was the successor of the Chief Commissioner of
Delhi; and if so, had by reason of the notification dated September 7, 1966 under Article 239 of the
Constitution the same powers and unctions that were exercisable by the Chief Commissioner in
relation to the lease. That would be so provided there was a notification issued by the President
under Art.239(1) vesting the Chief Commissioner with powers to administer the property of the
Union or lease of nazul properties in the Union Territory of Delhi. It is also necessary to consider
whether under the proviso to s.21 of the Part States Act, 1951, the so-called 'reserved powers' were
exercisable by the Lt. Governor in relation to the executive functions of the President under Art.53
of the Constitution as an agent or the nominee of the President and therefore he was entitled to act
on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of works & Housing.

Learned counsel appearing for respondent no.2 argues that the Lt. Governor had ample powers and
functions under the aforesaid notification dated September 7, 1966 and therefore it was incumbent
upon him to take necessary steps in due discharge of his official duties. The Lt. Governor was not a
‘stranger’, 'interloper’, 'intruder' or ‘usurper' acting without any warrant or semblance of power or
any authority as alleged and argued strenuously by the petitioners He says that there is a vast variety
of notifications which vest the office of the Lt. Governor with powers and functions of various
descriptions under various statutes, many of which are to be exercised by him in his discretion. He
contends that such powers are of a wide ranging nature which inhere in the office of the Lt.
Governor. he refers to several notifications in which the Administrator of Union Territory had been
variously described viz. as Chief Commissioner, Administrator or Lt. Governor and contends that
even while delegating the powers under Art. 239(1) of the Constitution, a continuum between the
office of the Chief Commissioner and that of the Lt. Governor was preserved and the terms used

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 85Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

interchangeably. All these powers and functions were essentially functional. Moreover, powers and
functions which vested in that office and which had a clear continuity of its own also implied powers
which were incidental and ancillary thereto. Such powers also necessarily included powers and
functions which were a necessary concomitant of the office.

Learned counsel contends that the office of the Administrator under Art.239(1) is the office of an
agent and representative of the President. It is the office of the Head of the Administration in
relation to the Union territory. He is not merely a formal or titular head but an effective and
executive head. The office is both formal and functional, and the Union Territory is administered by
the Union Executive through the Lt. Governor. In the ultimate analysis, the Lt. Governor has to be
the 'eyes and ears' as well as the 'limbs' of the President in the Union Territory which he is called
upon to administer on behalf of the President. He is also to keep in touch with every situation and to
take into account the representations and complaints in exercising the powers and discharging the
functions of his office. In these circumstances, the Lt.Governor was entitled to see whether there
was any definite matter of public importance which might eventually call for a detailed
administrative or statutory inquiry, either in respect of the conduct of the officer of the Delhi
Development Authority or those of the Municipal Corporation, and to satisfy himself with regard to
various matters and particularly whether there were any violations of town planning norms cr
sanction granted, whether the lease conditions were breached, whether similar concessions should
be granted to others similarly situate and whether any remedial measures were called for. He urges
that the complaints and representations with regard to Express Buildings were quite specific and the
pace of construction was particularly accelerated. The Lt. Governor had the powers and the duty to
inform himself of the fact and to be properly advised with regard to these matters. Instead of acting
in a surreptitious, clandestine or hurried manner, he appointed a committee of three senior officials
to ascertain the facts. In appointing such a committee he acted will within his powers and in a
wholly bona fide manner; indeed, he could also, if 80 satisfied, set up a commission of inquiry under
the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952.

The argument of learned counsel appearing for respondent no.2 based on the proviso to 8.21 of the
Government of Part States Act, 1951 that the 'reserved powers’ were still with the Administrator as
the Chief Commissioner of the Lt. Governor and therefore the Lt. Governor as the appointed agentor
nominee of the President was entitled to exercise the executive functions of the President under Art.
53 of the constitution and consequently was authorized to act on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of
India, Ministry of Works & Housing, is totally unwarranted. The contention overlooks the
constitutional changes brought about, as a result of which the territory of Delhi ceased to be
administered as a Chief Commissioner's Province by the Governor-General acting to such extent as
he thought fit through the Chief Commissioner appointed by him in his discretion under 8.94(3) of
the Government of India Act, 1935 and become a Part state on the inauguration of the Constitution
and had to be administered by the President under Art.239(1) acting to such extent as he thought fit
through a Chief Commissioner or a Lt. Governor to be appointed by him or through the Governor of
a neighbouring State. After the Seventh Amendment which reorganized the States, Part State of
Delhi was transformed into a Union Territory and has to be administered by the President under the
amended Art. 239(1), acting to such extent as he thinks fit, through an Administrator to be
appointed by him with such designation as he may specify. In September, 1951 an Act known as the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 86Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Government of Part States Act, 1951 was passed by Parliament. It was a law enacted by Parliament
under Art.240(1) to provide for the creation of Legislative Assemblies, Council of Ministers and
Councils of Advisors for Part States. Sub-s.(3) of 8.2 provided that any reference in the Act to the
Chief Commissioner shall, in relation to a State for the time being administered by the President
through a Lt. Governor be construed as a reference to the Lt.Governor. Cl.(2) of Art.240 provided
that such law shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution fr the purposes of Art.
368 notwithstanding that it contained any provision which amended or had the effect of amending
the Constitution. S.21 of the Act invested the Legislative Assemblies of such Part States with powers
of legislation with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent
List with the reservation contained tn the proviso thereto that the Legislative Assembly of the State
of Delhi Shall not have power to make laws with respect to the matters enumerateded therein, with
the overriding provision contained in sub-6.(2) that nothing in sub-s.(1) shall be in derogation of the
power conferred on Parliament by the constitution to make laws with respect to any matter for a
Part State or any part thereof.

It would therefore appear that the territory of Delhi as a Part State under the First Schedule to the
Constitution was a separate and distinct constitutional entity as from that of a Chief Commissioner's
Province under the Government of India Act, 1935, and this is equally true of the Union Territory of
Delhi. It must logically follow that with the transformation of the territory of Delhi from a Chief
Commissioner's Province under 8.94(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 into that of a Part
State under the Constitution and after the Seventh Amendment into the Union Territory of Delhi,
the office of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi disappeared and that of an Administrator appointed
by the President under Art. 239(1) with such designation as he may specify, come into existence. The
necessary concomitant is that the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi derived only such
powers, functions and duties as were entrusted to him by the President under Art. 239(1).

I would also refer to the case of Edward Mills Co. Ltd. Beawar, & Ors. y. State of Ajmer & Anr.,
[1955] 1S.C.R. 735, which was rightly not relied upon by learned counsel for the respondents as the
decision turned on its own facts. In that case it was held by the Constitution Bench that an order
made by the Governor-General under 6. 94(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 investing the
Chief Commissioner with the authority to administer a Chief Commissioner's Province as then
existing, must be regarded as a legislative act and as such treated as a ‘law in force’ falling within the
purview N of Art. 372 of the Constitution and therefore such an order made under 8.94(3) of the
Government of India Act, 1935 must be construed as an order made under Art. 239(1). The
Constitution Bench speaking through Mukherjee, J. after adverting to 6. 94(3) of the Government of
India Act, 1935, observed :

"An order made by the Governor-General under 6.94(3) investing the Chief
Commissioner with the authority to administer a province is really in the nature of a
legislative provision which defines the rights and powers of the Chief Commissioner
in respect of that province. In our opinion, such order comes within the purview of
Article 372 of the Constitution and being 'a law in force’ immediately before the
commencement of the Constitution would continue to be in force under clause (1) of
the Article. Agreeably to this view it must also be held that such order is capable of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 87Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

adaptation to bring provisions under cl.(2) of Article 372 and this is precisely what
has been done by the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950. Paragraph 26 of the Order
runs as follows : "Where any rule, order or other instrument was in force under any
provision of the Government of India Act, 1935, or under any Act amending or
supplementing that Act, immediately before the appointed day, and such provision is
re-enacted with or without modifications in the Constitution, the said rule, order or
instrument shall, so far as applicable, remain in force with the necessary
modifications as from the appointed day as if it were a rule, order or instrument of
the appropriate kind duly made by the appropriate authority under the said provision
of the Constitution, and may be varied or revoked accordingly.

Thus the order made under s. 94(3) of the Government of India Act should be
reckoned now as an order made under Article of the Constitution...... There was no
Order in Council issued by the Governor-General under Art. 94(3) of the Government
of India Act, 1935 nor any order issued by the President under Art. 239(1) of the
Constitution investing the Chief Commissioner of Delhi to deal with the property of
the Union. On October 1, 1959, decision was taken by the Government of India to
transfer the administrative control of the Land & Development Office from the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi to the ministry of Works & Housing. This decision was duly
communicated to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi and to the Land & Development
Officer. It is admitted in the further affidavit of M.K. Mukherjee, Secretary, Ministry
of works & housing dated November 16, 1982 that the office of the Land &
Development Officer was transferred to the control of the ministry of Works &
Housing w.e.f.

October 1, 1959 and since then it has been functioning as a subordinate office of the Ministry of
Works & Housing. Undoubtedly, the matters relating to the property of the Union of India are
included in the executive power of the Union under Art. 53 of the Constitution read with Art. 298
which expressly provides that the executive power of the Union shall extend to the acquisition,
holding that disposal of property and the making of contracts for any purpose. Such executive power
of the Union is vested in the President under Art. 53(1) and shall be exercised by him either directly
or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. All executive actions of
the Government of India shall be expressly taken in the name of the President under Art. 77(1).
Under cl.(2) thereof, orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the President
shall be authenticated as may be specified in rules to be made by the President i.e. in the manner
specified under the Authentication (Orders and other Instruments) Rules, 1958 framed under Art.
72(2). On January 18, 1961, the President made the Government of India (Allocation of Business)
Rules, 1961 under Art. 77(3) for the convenient transaction of business of the Government of India,
and for the allocation among Minister of the said business.

In terms of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, all matters relating to the
property of the Union, allotment of Government lands in Delhi, administration of Government
estates under the control of the Ministry of Works & Housing and the administration of the Land &
Development Office, are matters exclusively vested in the Ministry of Works & Housing vide Entries

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 88Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

1, 6 and 23(1) in the Second Schedule under the head 'Ministry of Works & Housing’. In the light of
the said directive, as further confirmed by the constitutionally enacted regulations, the power over
the allotment of nazul lands, administration of leases in Delhi and the control and administration of
Land & Development Office in particular and the property of the Union in general are subjects
vested solely under the control of the Ministry of Works & Housing. In the premises, by such
transfer of authority, the Chief Commissioner of Delhi and necessarily his successor, the Lt.
Governor, became bereft of his powers to control and administer the lease and any attempt by
respondent no.2 set up a claim that the Lt. Governor is the authority empowered to administer the
lease is wholly frivolous and untenable and must be rejected.

Whether the impugned Executive action was mala fide and politically motivated.

The principal point in controversy between the parties is whether the notice of re-entry upon
forfeiture of lease issued by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office dated March 10, 1980
purporting to be on behalf of the lesser i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing, and
that of March 1, 1980 issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal Corporation,
Delhi were wholly mala fide and politically motivated. It is a sad reflection on the state of affairs
brought about during the period of Emergency which brought into existence a totalitarian trend in
administration and I do not wish to aggravate any of its features by unnecessary allusions. In the
process, the country witnessed misuse of mass media totally inconceivable and unheard of in a
democratic form of Government by reduced freedom of the press by exercise of pre-censorship
powers, enactment of a set of draconian laws which reduced freedom of the press to a naught.

The petitioners have pleaded the facts with sufficient degree of particularity tending to show that the
impugned notices were wholly mala fide and politically motivated; mala fide, because the impugned
notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease dated March 10, 1980 issued by the Engineer Officer, Land
& Development Office under cl.5 of the indenture of lease dated March 17, 1558 for alleged breach of
cls. 2(14) and 2(5) which in fact were never committed and the notice dated March 1, 1980 by the
Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal Corporation for demolition of new Express
Building where the printing press is installed under 86. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal
Corporationration Act were really intended and meant to bring about the stoppage of the
publication of the Indian Express which has throughout been critical of the Government in power
whenever it went wrong on a matter of policy or in principle. Also, mala fide because they constitute
misuse of powers in bad faith. Use of power for a purpose other than the one for which the power is
conferred is mala fide use of power. Same is the position when an order is made for a purpose other
than that which finds place in the order.

It is somewhat strange that although definite allegation of mala fide on the part of the respondents
particularly the Government for the day at the Centre were made with sufficient particulars and
though the respondents had ample time to file their affidavits in reply, none of the respondents
except respondent no.5,, the Lt. Governor of Delhi and respondent no.5,, Land Development Officer
have chosen to deny the allegations.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 89Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

The counter-affidavit of respondent no.2 purporting to be on behalf of all the respondents is that the
allegations made by the petitioners in paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 are not 'relevant' to the matter in
issue. In C.I. Rowjee & Ors. v. A.P. State Road Transport Corporation, [1964] 4 S.C.R. 330, the Court
in a matter arising out of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 where certain allegations against the Minister
went uncontroverted, had occasion to administer a word of caution. Where mala fide are alleged, it
is necessary that the person against whom such allegations are made should come forward with an
answer refuting or denying such allegations. For otherwise such allegations remain unrebutted and
the Court would in such a case be constrained to accept the allegations so remaining unrebutted and
unanswered on the test of probability. That precisely is the position in the present case, m the
absence of any counter- affidavit by any of the respondents. One should have thought that the
Minister for Works & Housing should have sworn an affidavit accepting or denying the allegations
made by the petitioners. At our instance, M.K. Mukherjee, Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing
has filed a supplementary affidavit. He avers that the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 of
re-entry upon forfeiture of lease issued by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office was on
the basis of press reports i.e. reports of the press conference held by the It. Governor. Again, there is
no attempt on the part of the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing to deny the allegations of
mala fides on the part of the Government and its functionaries in issuing the impugned orders. On
the contrary, he avers that respondent no.1 ‘adopts the counter- affidavit filed by respondent no.2'.
It is not for the parties to say what is relevant or not. The matter is one for the Court to decide. There
is nothing before us from which we can say that the allegations in paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of the
petition made by the petitioners are not well- founded. Mala fides on the part of the Government in
power or its functionaries would be sufficient to invalidate the impugned notices. Fraud on power
vitiates the impugned orders if they were not exercised bona tide for the purpose for which the
power was conferred.

Professor de Smith in his monumental work the Judicial Review of Administration Action, 4th
edition at pp.335-36 says in his own terse language :

"The concept of bad faith eludes precise definition, but in relation to the exercise of
statutory powers it h may be said to comprise dishonesty (or fraud) and malice. A
power is exercised fraudulently if its repository intends to achieve an object other
than that for which he believes the power to have been conferred...... A power is
exercised maliciously if its repository is motivated by personal animosity towards
those who are directly affected by its exercise.

He then goes on to observe :

"If the Court concludes that the discretionary power has been used for an
unauthorized purpose it is generally immaterial whether its repository was acting in
good or bad faith. But there will undoubtedly remain areas of administration where
the subject matter of the power and the evident width of the discretion reposed in the
decisionmaker render its exercise almost wholly beyond the reach of judicial review.
In these cases the courts have still asserted jurisdiction to determine whether the
authority has endeavoured to act in good faith in accordance with the prescribed

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 90Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

purpose. In most instances the reservation for the case of bad faith is hardly more
than a formality. But when it can be established, the courts will be prepared to set
aside a judgment or order procured or made fraudulently despite the existence of a
generally worded formula purporting to exclude judicial review.

Bad faith is here understood by the learned author to mean intentional usurpation of, power
motivated by considerations that are incompatible with the discharge of public responsibility. In
requiring statutory powers to be exercised reasonably, in good faith, and on correct grounds, the
Courts are still working within the bounds of the familiar principle of ultra vires. The Court assumes
that Parliament cannot have intended to authorize unreasonable action which is therefore ultra vires
and void. This is the express basis of the reasoning in many well-known cases, on the subject. A
necessary corollary is that, as usual throughout administrative law, we are concerned only with acts
of legal power i.e. acts which, if valid, themselves produce legal consequence.

In general, however, the Courts adhere firmly to the wide meaning of ‘jurisdiction’ since this is the
sheet- anchor of their power to correct abuses. They appear to be willing to stretch the doctrine of
ultra vires to cover virtually all situations where statutory power is exercised contrary to some legal
principles. There are many cases in which a public authority is held to have acted for improper
motives or irrelevant considerations, or have failed to take account of relevant considerations, 60
that its action is ultra vires and void : H.W.R. Wade's Administrative Law, 5th edition at pp. 42, 348
and 369. The learned author aptly sums up situations in which error of Jurisdiction may arise, at

p.42:

"Lack of jurisdiction may arise in many ways. There may be an absence of those
formalities or things which are conditions precedent to the tribunal having any
jurisdiction to embark on an inquiry. Or the tribunal may at the end made an order
that it has no jurisdiction to make. Or in the intervening stage, while engaged on a
proper inquiry, the tribunal may depart from the rules of natural justice; or it may
ask itself the wrong questions; or it may take into account matters which it was not
directed to take into account. Thereby it would step outside its Jurisdiction. It would
turn its inquiry into something not directed by Parliament and fail to make the
inquiry which Parliament did direct. Any of these things would cause its purported
decision to be a nullity.

Fraud on power voids the order if it is not exercised bona fide for the end design. There is a
distinction between exercise of power in good faith and misuse in bad faith. The former arises when
an authority misuses its power in breach of law, say, by taking into account bona fide, and with best
of intentions, some extraneous matters or by ignoring relevant matters. That would render the
impugned act or order ultra vires. It would be a case of fraud on powers. The misuse in bad faith
arises when the power is exercised for an improper motive, say, to satisfy a private or personal
grudge or for wreaking vengeance of a Minister as in S. Pratap Singh v. State of Punjab, [1964] 4
S.C.R. 733. A power is exercised maliciously if its repository is motivated by personal Animosity
towards those who are directly affected by its exercise. Use of a power for an ‘alien' purpose other
than the one for which the power is conferred in mala fide use of that power. Same is the position

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 91Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

when an order is made for a purpose other than that which finds place in the order. The ulterior or
alien purpose clearly speaks of the misuse of the power and it was observed as early as in 1904 by
Lord Lindley in General Assembly of Free Church of Scotland v. Overtown, L.R. [1904] A.C. 515,
‘that there is a condition implied in this as well as in other instruments which create powers,
namely, that the powers shall be used bona fide for the purpose for which they are conferred’. It was
said that Warrington, C.J., in Short v. Poole Corporation, L.R. [1926] Ch. D.66, that :

"No public body can be regarded as having statutory authority to act in bad faith or
from corrupt motives, and any action purporting to be of that body, but proved to be
committed in bad faith or from corrupt motives, would certainly be held to be
inoperative.

In Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley, [1956] 1 Q.B. 702 at pp.712-13, Lord Denning, LJ. said :

"No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been
obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything.

See also, in L Lazarus case at p.722 per Lord Parker, CJ :

m

Fraud’ vitiates all transactions known to the law of however high a degree of solemnity.
All these three English decisions have been cited with approval by this Court in Partap Singh's case.

In Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia v. State of Bihar & Ors., [1966] 1 S.C.R. 708, it was laid down that the
Courts had always acted to restrain a misuse of statutory power and more readily when improper
motives underlie it. Exercise of power for collateral purpose has similarly been held to be a sufficient
reason to strike down the action. In State of Punjab v. Ramjilal & Ors., [1971] 2 S.C.R. 550, it was
held that it was not necessary that any named officer was responsible for the act where the validity
of action taken by a Government was challenged as mala fide as it may not be known to a private
person as to what matters were considered and placed before the final authority and who had acted
on behalf of the Government in passing the order. This does not mean that vague allegations of mala
fide are enough to dislodge the burden resting on the person who makes the same a though what is
required in this connection is not a proof to the hilt as held in Barium Chemicals Ltd. & Anr. v.
Company Law Board, [1966] Supp. S.C.R. 311, the abuse of authority must appear to be reasonably
probable.

In the present case, the petitioners have alleged several facts imputing improper motives which have
not been specifically denied and there is only a bare denial with the assertion that the facts are not
relevant. Mere denial of allegations does not debar the Courts from inquiring into the allegations. In
answer to the rule nisi, the respondents here and in particular respondent no.1, the Union of India,
Ministry of Works & Housing disdained from filing a counter- affidavit and left it to respondent
no.2, Lt. Governor of Delhi to controvert as best as he could the specific allegations made by the
petitioners that the impugned action was wholly mala fide and politically motivated i.e. that there
was malice in fact as well as malice in law which actuated the authorities in issuing the impugned

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 92Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

notices. Respondent no.2 did not controvert these allegations but asserted that the allegations were
‘wholly irrelevant' to the matter in issue. He disclaimed all responsibility for the issue of the
impugned notices and insteadtried to justify all his action throughout the affair as the Lt. Governor.
As the hearing progressed, on being putwise on the legal issues, respondent no.2 filed an additional
affidavit trying to refute the allegations of personal bias and animosity on his part. As already stated,
respondent no.1 put a supplementary affidavit of M.K. Mukherjee, Secretary, Ministry of Works &
Housing which instead of meeting the specific allegations made by the petitioners, avers that they
were wholly irrelevant and that the Union of India adopts the counter-affidavit filed by respondent
no.2. The submissions advanced at the Bar by learned counsel appearing for the Union of India were
wholly inconsistent with the stand taken by the respondents in their counter-affidavits. The learned
counsel made no attempt to refute the charge that the impugned notices were wholly mala fide and
politically motivated.

Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that during the period of Emergency, the Indian
Express had displayed exemplary courage in exposing the authoritarian trend of the Government of
the day. He further contended that the impugned notices constitute an act of personal vendetta
against the Express Group of Newspapers in general, and Ram Nath Goenka, Chairman of the Board
of Directors in particular. He also contended that respondent no.2 was actuated with personal bias
against the Indian Express and had file a criminal complaint against the Editor-in-Chief of the
Indian Express and some of the officers of the Express Group of Newspapers for having published
an article in the Indian Express in April 1977 with regard to his role during the period of Emergency
in the Turkman Gate demolitions. The Express Group of Newspapers, particularly the A Indian
Express, had during the period of Emergency and immediately thereafter openly criticised the
highhanded action of respondent no.2 who was the then Vice-Chairman of the Delhi Development
Authority and close to the powers that be. The submission is that the proposed act of re-entry by the
lessor i.e. the Union Or India, Ministry of Works & Housing at the instance of respondent no.2 was
meant to be an act of political vendetta. The learned counsel particularly highlighted the following
sequence of events of assumption of office by respondent no.2 as the Lt. Governor of Delhi on
February 17, 1980. It was pointed out that immediately upon assumption of office on the forenoon of
February 17, 1980 which was a Sunday, the first act of his was to summon the Municipal
Comissioner and to call for the files of the Indian Express Buildings. On the 18th morning the files
relating to the grant of sanction for the construction of the new Express Building were made
available to him. On February 20, 1980 admittedly the important files of the Delhi Development
Authority i.e. relating to the Express Buildings were sent to respondent no.2. On February 29, 1980
he, through the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Delhi caused the lacks of the office and
cupboards of the Zonal Engineer (Building) broken open to take away the files relating to the new
Express Building. Immediately thereafter on March 1, 1980, respondent no.2 convened a press
conference in which he handed over a press release (set out in the earlier part of the judgment)
alleging that the new Express Building put up by the petitioners was in contravention of law in
several respects.

On March 1, 1980 he purported to appointed what he termed in the counter-affidavit as a
commission of inquiry under s.3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 consisting of three

members, the Chief Secretary and two other officers of the Delhi Administration to make an

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 93Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

investigation into the circumstances under which the sanction was granted by the then Minister for
Works & Housing and the alleged breaches committed by the petitioners in the construction of the
Express Buildings. The learned counsel contends that the so-called inquiry directed by respondent
no.2 into the affairs of the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing was nothing short of
inquisition into the functioning of the previous Government at the Centre and particularly that of
Minister for Works & Housing. On the same day, the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone,
Municipal Corporation, presumably at the behest of respondent no.2 served a notice on petitioner
no.1 Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why action should not be taken for demolition of
the A Express Buildings under ss. 43 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.

Three days after i.e. On March 4, 1980 a second press release was issued from the Raj Nivas, the
official residence of respondent no.2 and sent by a special courier to all newspaper offices to justify
his action in initiating an inquiry and the mode that had been prescribed for holding such inquiry
Stating a show cause notice had been issued by the Municipal Corporation for unauthorized
deviations from the sanctioned plan in the construction of a double basement with a floor area of
23,000 square feet in the Municipal Corporation were summoned by respondent no.2 before the
press conference on March 1, 1980, the files of the Ministry of Works & Housing were summoned by
him in the first week of March, 1980. It is admitted by the Ministry that the said files were made
available to respondent no.2 on March 7, 1980. On March 7, 1980 the Land & Development Officer
acting as part of the overall plan of respondent no.2 and presumably at his instigation issued a show
cause notice in terms set out above. Admittedly, on that day the files of the Ministry of Works &
Housing had been handed over by the Ministry to the Three Member Committee constituted by
respondent no.2.

On March 10, 1980 the Engineer Officer in the Land & Development Office under the Ministry of
Works & Housing issued a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease in supersession of his earlier
notice dated March 7, 1980 under cl. 5 of the perpetual lease-deed dated March 17, 1958 while
alleging several breaches of cl.. 2(14) and 2(53 thereof and proposing re-entry by the lessor i.e. the
Union of India. On March 12, 1980 at a specially convened pres conference, respondent released the
report of the Three-Member Committee which substantiated the allegations he had aired at his
press conference on March 1, 1980 and through the press release of March 4, 1980. The learned
Counsel particularly relied upon the averment of respondent no.2 in para 89 of the
counter-affidavit, set out at the beginning of this judgment, that the breach was 'irremediable' and
therefore 'the lease was liable to be forfeited’ and 'the Express Buildings built thereon demolished’.
Learned counsel contends that these facts clearly show that the impugned notices were issued in bad
faith and actuated by improper motives. He accordingly contends that the impugned action was
wholly mala fide and politically motivated.

The expression 'Government' in the context 18 the functionary of the Central Government i.e. the
Minister for Works Housing who is vested with executive power in the relevant field. The executive
power of the Union vested in the President under Art. 53(1) connotes the residual or governmental
functions that remain after the legislative and judicial functions are taken away. m e executive power
with respect to the great departments of the Government are exercisable by the Ministers of the
concerned departments by virtue of Rules of Business issued by the President under Art. 77(3). For

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 94Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

purposes of the present controversy, the functionary who took action and presumably on whose
instructions the impugned notices were issued was no one than the Lt. Governor of Delhi who,
according to learned counsel for respondent no.1., could not usurp the powers and functions of the
Union of India in relation to the property of the Union and therefore had no functions in relation to
the lease in question. It seems that the Minister for Works & Housing was taking his orders from
respondent no.2. The dominant purpose which actuated respondent no.2 in initiating governmental
action was not 80 much for implementation of the provisions cf the Master Plan or the Zonal
Development Plans framed under the Delhi Development Act or the observance of the relevant
Municipal Bye-laws under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, but to use these provisions for an
‘alien’ purpose and in bad faith i.e. for demolition of the express Buildings with a mark of retribution
or political vendetta for the role of the Indian Express during the period of Emergency and
thereafter and thereby to bring about closure of the Indian Express. If the act was in excess of the
power granted to the Lt. Governor or was an abuse or misuse of power, the matter is capable of
interference by the Court.

The Court in Pratap Singh's case observed that the Constitution enshrines and guarantees the rule of
law and the power of the High Courts under Art.226 (which is equally true of Art.32) is designed to
ensure that each and every authority in the State, including the Government, acts bona fide and
within the limits of its powers and that when a court is satisfied that there is an abuse or misuse of
power and its jurisdiction is invoked, it is incumbent on the Court to afford justice to the individual.
The Court further observed that in such an event the fact that the authority concerned denies the
charge of mala fide, or asserts the absence of oblique motives, or of its having taken into
consideration improper or irrelevant matter, does not preclude the Court from inquiring into the
truth of the allegations made against the authority and affording appropriate relief to the party
aggrieved by such illegality or abuse of power in the event of the allegations being made out.

As against the Government at the Center, the allegations in the Writ Petitions can conveniently be
classified into three groups.The first set of circumstances relates to the period prior to the
Parliamentary elections in 1971, and the second to the period subsequent thereto till tho declaration
of Internal Emergency by the President on June 25, 1975 and the third relates to the period during
the Emergency and thereafter. The petitioners allegations may be thus summarized. The Express
Group of Newspapers in general and the Indian Express in particular have always taken in
independent stand and have been critical of the Government and the authorities and of any
authoritarian trend and had therefore been Considerably harassed in various way. For over a
decade, Congress Government have had an animosity against the petitioners and have tried in many
ways to finish them off. After the Congress split of 1969 the Indian Express severly criticised those
who had backed out from supporting the official Congress candidate. As a result, various
administrative agencies began roving and fishing inquiries into the affairs of the Express Group of
Companies. On more occasions then one, matters relating to petitioner no.3 Ram Nath Goenka and
the Express Group of Companies were discussed in Parliament. After the Congress (R) secured
overwhelming majority in the 1971 Parliamentary elections, the Express Group of Companies and
petitioner no.3 had to wage a constant battle for survival on various fronts and against various
onslaughts. The animosity of the Congress (R) Government towards the petitioners intensified after
the Gujarat and Bihar Movements gathered strength. Because of the close association of petitioner

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 95Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

no.3 Ram Nath Goenka with the late Shri Jayaprakash Narayan, efforts were made to secure hie
cooperation to persuade the late Shri Jayaprakash Narayan to withdraw from the Bihar Movement.
His refusal to intercede on behalf of the Government led to further inquiries by which both he and
the Express Group of companies were sought So be pressurized and persecuted.

The White Paper on the Misuse of Mass Media during the Internal Emergency issued by the
Government of India in August, 1977 brigs out certain facts. After the Proclamation of Emergency by
the President On June 5, 175, various acts of repression were perpetrated against the Express Group
o Companies subverting lawful processes, well-established conventions and administrative
procedures and practices and by abuse of authority and misuse of power. It was evident therefore
that a ‘high level meeting' where the Ministers of Law & Justice and Information & Broadcasting
were present, it was decided that ‘inquiries into the Express Group of Newspapers and Shri Ram
NathGoenka's industrial empire were to be given immediate attention’. All that the Express Group
of Newspapers, particularly the Indian Express, had to face during the Emergency is now a matter of
history.

There is a considerable body of literature dealing with the role of the media during the period of
Emergency. Perhaps the two best known papers which attempted to stand up to the Government's
repressive tactics were the Indian Express and the Statesman. The Indian Express had been cool to
Government pressure to publicize the benefits of Emergency. The Government then arrested Kuldip
Nayar, the Editor-in-Chief, dissolved the Board of Directors and appointed a new Board under the
Chairmanship of K.K. Birla consisting of persons approved by the Government; printed in other
newspapers allegations of financial offences committed by petitioner no.3 Ram Nath Goenka, the
proprietor of the paper; withdrew Government advertisements and reduced the credit limits
provided by the banks; cut off the supply of electricity and finally issued an abrupt notice of the
auctioning of the Indian Express Buildings at New Delhi for failure to pay outstanding taxes - which
Goenka was disputing in Court. The Express Building was sealed of for two days but by that time the
harassment of the newspaper had attracted attention throughout the word. This became an
embarrassment to the Government which stopped some of the harassment but continued the
financial persecution. The newspaper was about to collapse when the new elections of 1977 gave it a
new life. White Paper on Misuse of Mass Media at paragraphs 38 to 44; Shah Commission's Report
at pp. 34-35, Indian Politics and the Role of the Press by Shared Karkhanis at pp. 139-140.

As against respondent no.2,, it was suggested during the course of hearing by learned counsel for the
petitioners that obviously one of the tasks entrusted to respondent no.2 as the Lt. Governor of Delhi
was to ‘discipline the press' by demolition of the Express Buildings. I refrain from expressing any
opinion on that aspect but it is quite evident that no action was contemplated against the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. by any of the respondents prior to February 17, 1980. Respondent no.2 upon
assumption of his office as the Lt. Governor of Delhi on that day immediately set on a course of
action against the Indian Express which culminated in the issue of the impugned notices. It cannot
be doubted that his initiative to call for the files from the Municipal Corporation relating to the
construction of the new Express Building was an action of his own not provoked by anyone, much
less at the instance of respondent no.1, the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing. The
sequence of events set in motion immediately after his assumption of office as the Lt. Governor have

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 96Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

already been set out in detail which demonstrate the extent to which and the keenness with which he
pursued the matter. It would appear that the entire administrative machinery was geared into action
by respondent no.2 and he 'activated' the taking of steps culminating in the issue of the impugned
notices.

In their effort to salvage the situation,learned counsel appearing for respondents nos.1 and 2 during
the course of their respective submissions tried to impress upon us that it cannot be said from the
circumstances appearing that the authorities have not acted bona fide with the object of using their
powers for the purposes authorised by the Legislature but had acted with an ulterior object to
achieve any Minister or collateral purpose. The submissions of learned counsel for respondent no.1
may be summarized thus : (1) There was no imminent danger of demolition of the Express Building
nor was the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 issued by the Engineer Officer, Land &
Development Office, a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease. It was merely a notice of an
exploratory nature requiring the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the lease should
not be forfeited under cl.5 of the lease-deed for alleged breaches of cls.2(5) and 2(14) thereof. The
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. should have therefore entered appearance before the Land &
Development Officer and showed cause against the action proposed. It was only if the Land &
Development Officer was not satisfied with their explanation, that he would put up the papers
before the Lt. Governor for necessary action. It would then be for the lessor i.e. the Union of India,
Ministry of Works & Housing to decide whether or not the lease should be forfeited under cl. 5 of the
lease-deed. (2) He drew our attention to the Supplementary affidavit of M.K. Mukherjee, Secretary,
Ministry of Works & Housing where it was denied that the impagned notice of re-entry dated March
10, 1980 was issued by the Engineer Officer at the behest or at the instigation of the Lt. Governor.
Mukherjee had averred therein that S. Rangaswami, Additional Land & Development Officer called
for a report and the file of the case on March 5, 1980 when a press clipping was put up to him in the
usual course from the office of the Public Relations Officer. The Engineer Officer asked for putting
up tho case with a detailed note immediately. The decision to send the notice 9 taken without the
reference to the Lt. Governor. A note on the file pointed out that the rate at which the plot was
initially given to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. was concessional @ Rs. 36,000 per acre as
against the prevailing rate of Rs. 1.25 000 per acre for construction of building. The note was put up
by Rangaswami to the Land Development officer and was also seen by tho Joint Secretary (Delhi
Division) and the Secret Ministry of Work & Housing. In this note, Rangaswami further pointed out
that additional premium and additional ground rent would at all events to recovered from the lessee
together with interest. The learned counsel accordingly contended that it was on the basis of this
that the impugned notice was issued by the Engineer Officer on March 10, 1980 and said that it was
worthwhile mentioning that till then the report of the Three- Member Committee was not before the
Central Government, nor WAS there any coo communication in that behalf from the Lt. Governor.
The report of the Committee was itself dated March 12, 1980 and a copy thereof was forwarded by
the Lt. Governor on March 14, 1980. It was therefore urged that the impugned notice by the
Engineer Officer purporting to act on behalf of the lessor i.e. the union of India, Ministry of Works
Housing was not based either on the report of the Three-Member Committee obtained by the Lt.
Governor or on the basis of any communication from him. (3) Further, he urged that the Lt.
Governor as the Administrator had to keep himself informed and cannot be aid to have acted mala
fide merely because of any possible personal malus animus on his part, if the quality of the action

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 97Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

WAS itself in complete accord with the law. (4) It was said that the Government itself was in
possession of relevant records and applied its mind to them and the impugned notice issued by the
Engineer Officer who was empowered to act on b half of the President under Art. 299(1) of the
Constitution having been authenticated in the manner required by Art. 77(3), it must be deemed to
be the decision of the President on the advice of the Council of Ministers as enjoined by Art. 74(2)
and the Court was precluded from making any investigation into the Circumstances attendant (5)
Finally, he submitted that it was for respondent no.2 to meet the charges of mala fides levelled
against him. Whatever be the merit of the charge against the Lt. Governor, his action led only to the
collection of material on the basis of which the impugned notice was issued, and the action of
respondent no.1 was unassailable. I find it rather difficult to accept this line of argument which is
nothing but an afterthought.

While adhering to his stand that the Lt. Governor was a successor to the Chief Commissioner ofDelhi ant was therefore competent to exercise the powers of the lessor i.e. the Union of India,
Ministry of Works & Housing, in relation to the lease-deed and that the Land & Development Officer
was under his administrative control, learned counsel for respondent no.2 refuted the charge of
personal bias. He reiterated that the Lt. Governor was the alter ego of the President in relation to
such territory which he is called upon to administer on behalf of the President. One of the primary
functions of the Lt. Governor, as the Administrator, was to be aware of facts brought to his
knowledge and therefore respondent no.2 could not have turned a blind eye to the action of
Sikander Bakht, the then Minister for Works & Housing in making a highly fraudulent, illegal and
improper grant of sanction to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to build the new Express Building
with an increased FAR of 360. He also maintained that the Lt. Governor as the appointed agent or
nominee of the President was entitled to act on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry
of Works & Housing in relation to the lease. Further, the contention was that respondent no.2 as the
Lt. Governor was well within his rights (1) in calling for and making perusal of the respective files
from the Ministry of Works & Housing, Delhi Development Authority and the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi pertaining to the construction of the new Express Building with an increased
FAR of 360, (2) in constituting a Three-Member Committee to inquire into the circumstances
relating to the grant of sanction by the then Minister for Works & Housing and to take necessary
steps as regards the unauthorised construction of the new Express Building, and (3) in forwarding
the report of the Three-Member Committee to the concerned authority, meaning the Minister for
Works & Housing for taking necessary steps. It was contended that the petitioners have made wild,
reckless and baseless allegations against respondent no.2 merely because he directed an
investigation into the affairs. In any event, he contended that this was a case of transferred malice
and the question of mala fides could not be decided without impleading the late Prime Minister. I
am afraid, the contention cannot prevail. The petitioners have impleaded respondent no.1, the
Union of India and pleaded the necessary facts with sufficient particulars. The lightening speed with
which respondent no.2 acted on assumption of his office as the Lt. Governor of Delhi on February
17, 190 creates an impression that he started an ‘inquisition into the affairs of the previous
Government at the Centre. One should have thought that respondent no.2 holding the high position
as the Lt.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 98Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Governor should have acted with greatest circumspection, than arrogate to himself the powers of the
Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing in relation to the property of the Union, including the
lease in question. It was somewhat strange that the Land & Development Officer who was a minor
functionary of the Ministry of Works & Housing should have filed a counter supporting the action of
respondent no.2. I regret to say that the Land & Development Officer deliberately made an
inaccurate statement that he is not under the administrative control of the Ministry.

I may now deal with the submissions advanced by learned counsel for respondent no.1. The
contention that there was no imminent danger of demolition of the Express Building nor was the
impugned notice by the Engineer Officer a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease, is against the
very terms of the impugned notice. The submissions of the learned counsel run counter to the
counter-affidavit filed by respondent no.2 on behalf of the respondents. There is a categoric
averment that the grant of sanction by the then Minister for Works & Housing was illegal, improper
and irregular. It is therefore futile to contend that the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 was
not a notice of re- entry upon forfeiture of lease but merely a notice of an exploratory nature
requiring Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the lease should not be forfeited under
cl. 5 of the lease-deed. Further, the contention that the decision to send the notice was taken without
reference to the Lt. Governor does not appear to be substantiated by the facts on record. me
so-called note of Rangaswami, Additional Land & Development Officer put up before the Joint
Secretary (Delhi Division) or the Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing was for making a demand
for payment of additional premium and ground rent and it never authorized the issue of the
impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 by the Engineer Officer directing a forfeiture of the lease.

The facts speak for themselves. M.K.. Mukherjee, Secretary, Ministry of Works & Housing in his
supplementary affidavit avers that the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 was issued by the
Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office on the basis of press reports i.e. reports of the press
conference called by respondent no.2 on March 4, 1980. The sudden spurt of activity on the part of
Rangaswami Additional Land & Development Officer calling for a report and the file ant the
Engineer Officer directing that the case be put up with a detailed note immediately on March 5,
1980 is a circumstance which speaks for itself. It followed upon the press conference called by
respondent no.2 on March 4, 1980 after A the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal
Corporation, Delhi had already issued a notice on March 1, 1980 requiring Express Newspapers Pvt.
Ltd. to show cause why the double basement of the new Express Building where the printing press
was installed should not be demolished under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation
Act, 1957. These circumstances clearly show that the respondents were building up a case against
the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.

In the facts and circumstances, I am constrained to hold that the impugned notices dated March 1,
1980 and March 10, 1980 were not issued bona fide in the ordinary course of official business for
implementation of the law or for securing justice but were actuated with an ulterior and extraneous
purpose and thus were wholly mala fide and politically motivated.

Whether construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 constitutes a
breach of the Master Plan or the Zonal Development Plan or Clauses 2(5) and 2(14) of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 99Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

lease-deed. I. The Delhi Development Act, 1957: Master Plan for Delhi: Zonal Development Plan for
D-II area viz. the Press Enclave in the Mathura Road Commercial Complex.

Question is as to whether the construction of the new Express Building on the residual area of 2740
sq.yards on the western portion of plots nos. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg with an increased
FAR of 360 constitutes a breach of cls. 2(5) and 2(14) which entitled the Engineer Officer, Land &
Development Office, Ministry of Works & Housing to issue the impugned notice of re-entry dated
March 10, 1980 purporting to act on behalf of the Government of India, Ministry of Works &
Housing to show cause why the Union of India should not re-enter upon and take possession of
plots nos. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg together with the Express Buildings built thereon
under cl.5 of the indenture of lease dated March 17, 1958. It is not disputed that the Ministry of
Works & Housing with the Minister at the head was responsible for the following items of work viz.
the Property of the Union, Town and Country Planning, Delhi Development Authority, Master Plan
for Delhi and Administration of the Delhi Development Act, 1957 and Allotment of Government
lands in Delhi, and was also responsible for all attached and subordinate offices or organizations
concerned with any of the subjects specified aforesaid including the subordinate office of the Land &
Development Officer, New Delhi, dealing with the administration of lease of nazul lands. The
functions of the Ministry of Works & Housing are described in Chapter XXV of the publication
entitled Organizational set up and Functions of the Ministries Departments of the Government of
India, issued by the Department of Personnel & Administrative Reforms, Cabinet Secretariat,
Government of India. Hence, the Minister for Works & Housing was and is the ultimate authority
responsible for the following items of work viz. the property of the Union, town and country
planning, Delhi Development Authority, Master Plan of Delhi, Administration of Delhi Development
Act, 1957, Land & Development Office dealing with the administration of nazul landsin the Union
Territory of Delhi.

It is common ground that the Press Enclave on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg otherwise known as the
Mathura Road Commercial Complex is not a ‘development area' within the meaning of s.2(3)(3) of
the Delhi Development Act, 1957. Admittedly, the Master Plan does not prescribe any FAR for the
Mathura Road Commercial Area. In the Master Plan at p.50 the permitted uses in the Use Zone C-2,
namely, the zone in which the press area falls are specifically mentioned and it is clear therefrom
that the generally permitted uses do not include Newspaper and printing presses. The business of
printing and publishing of newspapers and installation of printing press is permissible only if such
user is allowed by competent authority after special appeal. S. 14 of the Act prohibits any person
from using or permitting to be used any land or building in any area otherwise than in conformity
with the plans. The Delhi Development Authority by its letter dated November 4, 1978 conveyed to
the petitioners that the set of building plans submitted by the petitioners had been examined as per
norms and the Authority had no objection to the amalgamation of plots nos. 9 and 10 and in
allowing an overall FAR of 360 taking into account the existing FAR. It was further stated that the
basement had been excluded from the calculations of the FAR. The installation of the press
machinery like any other service machinery was expressly permitted. The petitioners were directed
to submit the plans to the concerned authorities as per norms. It would therefore appear that the
construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 for starting a Hindi
Newspaper and the installation of the printing press in the double basement was allowed by the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 100Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Delhi Development Authority, in accordance with the provisions of the Master Plan.

It is clear from the provisions of s.12(4) read with 6. ]4 that permission for development of the
residual area i.e. the construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 by the
petitioners for use as a printing press had to be sough, for, and was given, by the competent
authority i.e. the Delhi Development Authority after 'special appeal’ in accordance with the
provisions of the Master Plan. Where permission for development in respect of such land had been
applied for and obtained under the Act, the construction of the Express Building undertaken and
carried out in terms thereof could not be treated to have been unlawfully undertaken or carried out
under s. 53(3)(a) of the Act. As already stated, the Central Government through the Ministry of
Works & Housing is given an overriding authority in the matter of administration of the Delhi
Development Act including the Master Plan, and the Zonal Development Plans, and the provisions
of the Delhi Development Act take effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent there with
contained in any other law. That is to say, merely because the Municipal Corporation of Delhi while
granting sanction to the building plan on January 9, 1979 got deleted the basement beyond plinth
line as well as the second basement, that was of no legal consequence. By virtu of the permission
granted by the DDA to the sanction Plan of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360
with a double basement beyond the plinth area for installation of the printing press, the same must
prevail. Under 6. 41(3) of the Act, the Central Government through the Ministry of Works &
Housing had certainly the authority to issue a direction to the Delhi Development Authority to
examine the question as to whether the petitioners could be granted permission to construct the
Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for installation of the
Printing press. and to grant Permission therefore.

The Floor Area Ratio, commonly known as 'FAR' is the restriction on the number of floors in a
building with reference to the plot area.

Part of Chapter II of the Master Plan contains the Zoning Regulations which form an integral part of
the Master Plan which indicate the land use permissible in various zones and the density, coverage,
floor area ratio and set- backs for various types of development. Paragraph 2 has divided the Union
Territory of Delhi for purposes of the zoning regulations into twenty-four use zones. Each use zone
has its special regulations because a single set of regulations cannot be applied to the entire city, as
different use zones vary in their character and functions. The area in question falls in Use Zone C-2 :
General Business and Commercial, District Centre, Sub- District Centre etc. Paragraph 4 contains
provisions regarding uses in the various use zones, such as residential, commercial, industrial,
recreational etc. At P- 50, there are provisions relating to Use Zone C-1: Retail Shopping. The
permitted uses in Use Zone C-2, namely, the zone in which the press area is located do not include
"Newspapers and printing presses except where allowed by competent authority after special
Appeal- Paragraph 5 contains provisions regarding density, coverage, floor area ratio requirements.
At p.60, these requirements for commercial and retail areas are set out under Item IV. It would
appear that the commercial areas of Connaught Place Extension, Minto Road and Ranjit Singh Road
are in zone D- IT. The FAR for Connaught Place Extension in zone D-I was reduced on April 27,
1974 to 250 but the FAR of the other commercial areas, namely, of Minto Road and Ranjit Singh
Road remained at 400. The relevant extract is as below :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 101Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

"IV. Commercial I and Retail ;

(a) Connaught Place Extension, Minto Road and Ranjit Singh Road - The size of plot
will naturally depend on the layout of the commercial area but any further
sub-division of plots in the Connaught Place and its proposed extension area is not
desirable.

FAR 400 Maximum ground floor coverage 50% Covered garages for cars & cycles 5%
First floor coverage 50% Coverage for second floor and above 35% There is a limit to
the number of floors but this is subject to light and air planes.

Semi-basement is allowed with a coverage not exceeding the ground floor for
parking, servicing and storage and the same is not taken into FAR calculations."

The Master Plan then provides for FAR coverage for already built-up commercial areas and a list of
19 localities is set out and they all relate to the walled city of Delhi like Chandni Chowk etc. To this
was added as the 20th item Jhandewalan Scheme on December 24, 1976.

The entire case of the Union of India as well as the other respondents as presented before us is that
under the Master Plan an FAR exceeding 300 was totally prohibited for any commercial area
including the Mathura Road Commercial Complex. This is factually wrong. The Master Plan
admittedly does not refer to the press enclave situate on the Mathura Road commercial area, nor
does such area fall within the already built-up commercial areas i.e. the walled city of Old Delhi, as
set out in the Master Plan at pp.60-61. Since the attempt of the respondents is to bring the press
area within he FAR coverages prescribed for the already built-up commercial areas in the walled city
of Old Delhi, it is of utmost importance for a proper understanding of the case to set out the relevant
portion :

"IV. Commercial and Retail

(b) F.A.R, coverages etc. for already built-up Commercial areas in the Walled City like
Chandni Chowk, etc. (List given below) :

In such cases, coverages permissible would be as applicable in the existing building
bye-laws of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, e.g., 80 per cent on the ground floor
and 70 per cent on the first floor and 80 on, with 150 F.A.R. for a two- storey
construction, 200 F.A.R. for a three-storey construction, 250 F.A.R. for a four-storey
construction and 80 on, provided that the F.A.R. will not exceed 300.

Eventually, Learned Counsel appearing for respondent no.1 had to accept that the already built-up
commercial areas set out in the Master Plan at p.61 dealt with areas other than Mathura Road
Commercial Area where the press area in question is situate.
It is quite obvious that the Master Plan does not prescribe any FAR for the press enclave situate on
Mathura Road commercial area nor does such area fall within the already built-up commercial area
as defines in the Master Plan i.e. commercial area falling within the walled city of Old Delhi.
Apparently, the contention that the FAR of no commercial area in Delhi can exceed 400 is wholly
misconceived inasmuch as the Master Plan in express terms permits FAR of the commercial areas in

Minto- Road and Ranjit Singh Road at 400. The Zonal Development Plan for the D-II area approved

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 103Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

by the Central Government in November 1966 mentions four commercial areas, namely, (1) Asaf Ali
Road commercial area (2) Minto Road commercial area (3) Mathura Road commercial area, and (4)
Circular Road Commercial area (opposite Ramlila Ground). It is provided that the general
regulations for development should be an FAR of 400 in respect of these areas, the total area of
which is stated to be 30.50 acres. It is therefore entirely incorrect to say that where in Delhi is there
an FAR of more than 300 for any commercial area as stated in the Report of the Town & Country
Planning Organisation dated April 14, 1978 relied upon by the respondents. In the Zonal
Development Plan for a D-II area, it is mentioned that Asaf Ali Road commercial area is fully
developed and there is no room for its expansion , but the same is not said about Mathura Road
commercial area which is described as fully commercialized with press and other allied trading
buildings. The statement relating to Mathura Road commercial area is set out below :

"Similarly Mathura Road commercial area is also fully commercialized with press and
other allied trade buildings according to building bye-laws to built-up areas.

It would be seen the statement is prefaced by the word 'similarly' and thereafter the word '‘also'
appears.

Learned counsel appearing for respondent no.1 the Union of India contends that the use of the word
‘similarly' can only mean that Mathura Road commercial area is also fully developed like Asaf Ali
Road commercial area, and further that the statement that buildings on Mathura Road have been
constructed according to the building bye-laws applying to built-up areas means that it was fully
commercialized and had been built-up according to the relevant bye-laws which regulates and
control the construction of commercially built-up area and therefore the relevant bye-law applicable
would be bye-law no.25(2) (IV) (B) of the Municipal Bye-laws which puts a ceiling on FAR at 300.
He tries a draw support, for this contention from what next follows in the Zonal Development Plan
where it is stated "Only two areas, namely, circular Road and Minto Roads commercial areas are to
be developed . It is said that the significance of the word 'only' can mean nothing than that like the
other similar areas, namely, Asaf Ali Road commercial area and Minto Road commercial area,
Mathura Road commercial areas had no room for expansion because it was also fully developed.
According to him, what follows immediately thereafter in the Master Plan is to provide for general
regulations for development and not to areas which are fully developed and such regulations for
development cannot therefore apply to such areas. I am afraid, on a plain construction, the
contention cannot be accepted.

The word 'similarly', in the context in which it appears, can only imply that Mathura Road
commercial area as having close resemblance even though obviously distinct in nature i.e. although
Asaf Ali Road commercial area is fully developed, in comparison Mathura Road commercial area
bears a marked likeness or resemblance as it is fully commercialized. But by no rule of construction
it 16 susceptible of the meaning that it is fully developed. I cannot but take judicial notice of the fact
that at the time when the Zonal Development Plans were Approved by the Central Government in
November 1966, the development in the press area was still going on since the Gandhi Memorial
Hall, otherwise known as Pearey Lal Bhawan on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg was then under
construction. Besides, even the so-called fully developed areas, viz., the Asaf Ali Road commercial

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 104Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

area which was not fully developed, they would not be subject to the restriction FAR of 300 and a
fortiori the Mathura Road commercial area so long as they were not brought within the purview of
paragraph 4(b) of the Master Plan by a notification issued by the Central Government for their
inclusion in the list of ‘already built-up commercial areas' as specified at p.61. A building in these
areas can always be pulled down and reconstructed with an FAR of 400. The Express Newspapers
Pvt. Ltd. have placed on record a recent advertisement dated March 8, 1982 issued by the Delhi
Development Authority as published in the Indian Express announcing public auction of certain
plots of land in the Asaf Ali Road commercial area. It is mentioned in the advertisement that the
auction purchaser would be entitled to construct a building with the following specifications :

"Apart from basement of 86.11% of ground floor coverage of 100%, a mezzanine floor
of 25% of the ground floor, four floors each of 75% coverage, to the benefit of a higher
FAR being permitted in future. subject only to proportionate payment of premium.

It 18 therefore evident that although in the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area, Asaf Ali Road
commercial area is described as fully developed with no room for expansion, the FAR of which is
admittedly 400, there could be still a further increase in FAR subject to payment of premium. This
could only be under the provisions of the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area and therefore it
must logically follow that the FAR prescribed in the Zonal Development Plan for Mathura Road
commercial area where the press enclave is situate is 400. It is of some significance that the
aforesaid advertisement had been issued by none else than P. Chakravarty, one of the members of
the Three- Member Committee. It is regrettable that the Three-Member Committee should have
purposely misled the authorities by describing the press area on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg as an
‘already built-up area’ which relates to the walled city of Old Delhi for which the FAR beyond 300
was not permissible. The press area is in Mathura Road commercial area which is not far from Asaf
Ali Road commercial area. It not only falls in the same D-II area but is treated as part of a complex
of four commercial areas in the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area. This press area is not even
described as fully developed as is the Asaf Ali Road commercial area; it is only describe as fully
commercialized. If FAR 400 is prescribed and allowed for Asaf Ali Road commercial Area which is
fully developed, it could not possible be impermissible for the press area which although fully
commercialized was still not fully developed.

There is no factual basis for the assertion of the respondents that nowhere in Delhi the FAR for any
commercial area can exceed 300. This is directly contrary to plots in Asaf Ali Road commercial area
which have FAR 400 and a ground coverage of more than 90%. As already stated, the Delhi
Development Authority has sold by public auction plots which permit construction of commercial
buildings with FAR of 400, basement of 86.11% and 100% ground coverage. In Bhikaji Cama Place,
the Delhi Development Authority has auctioned plots for construction of a five-star hotel Hyatt
Regency with an FAR of more than 500. Even 'Vikas Minar', the main building which houses the
offices of the Delhi Development Authority situate on I.P. Estate, in close proximity to the Mathura
Road Commercial Area, in the D-II area in Use Zone D-II for which the permissible FAR is 150 has
been built-up with an FAR exceeding 400. II. The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 : The Delhi
Municipal (Building) Bye-laws, 1959 : Applicability of Bye-law 25(2) (IV-B).

It is significant that the allegation of the alleged breach of FAR regulation is made for the first time
in the affidavits and which forms the many plank of the arguments asserting the right of the lessor
i.e. the Union of India, the re-entry upon forfeiture of lease is not foreshadowed in either of the
impugned notices dated March 1, 1980 or March 10, 1980 issued by the Engineer Officer, Land &
Development Office. But, since the point has been argued at great length and since the argument is
that the permission accorded by Sikander Bakht, the then Minister for Works & Housing was
non-est if the FAR exceeded the legal limit of FAR 300, this question has to be dealt with on merits.
According to the Union of India, both in the arguments as well as in the affidavits, it is asserted that
in processing the application for additional construction i.e. Of the new Express Building proceeded
on the basis that the FAR in the Press Area was 300. The assertion that every officer referred to only
an FAR 300 for the Press Area is based upon the TCPO's note dated April 14, 1978 mentioned in
Three Member Committee's report in which it is specifically stated :

"As per Master Plan, FAR 300 in Commercial area does not exist for any area in Delhi
whatsoever."

As stated above, this was factually wrong being contrary to the Master Plan and the Zonal
Development Plan for the D-II area. It is also contrary to the fact that: (1) In the Asaf Ali Road
commercial area, plot. are of FAR 400 and ground coverage of more than 90%, (2) In Bhikaji Cama
Place plots have been auctioned for the construction of Five Star Hotel with an FAR of mo re than
500; (3) Vikas Minar, the Delhi Development Authority's building is constructed with an FAR
exceeding 400 situate in 'Use Zone : Government and semi- Government Offices', for which the
permissible FAR is only

150. There is no material on record to substantiate that there is no specific rule or bye-law laying
down FAR ceiling for the Press Area was 300. In fact, The Union of India in the very first affidavit

unequivocally admits this position and avers :

".... It is submitted that under the Master Plan, Commercial and Retail Zone is
divided into the following parts :

(1) Connaught Place Extension, Minto Road and Ranjit Singh Road.
(ii) Already built up commercial area in the walled city, like Chandni Chowk, etc.

(iii) District Centres and proposed central business districts in Shahdara and Karol
Bagh.

(iv) Community Centres and retail centres shown in the Plan.

(v) Neighbouring shopping center. It is no doubt true that none of these areas make
any specific reference to Press Enclave situated on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 106Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

(Emphasis supplied) It is therefore admitted that the Master Plan does not prescribe
any FAR for the Press Area in the Mathura Road commercial area.

Learned counsel appearing for the Union of India seeks to spell out new argument that none of the
officials who were conversant with the matter ever referred to an FAR of 400 the mentioned in the
Zonal Development Plan for D-II area (which comprises of the press area) and contends that since
in the Zonal Development Plan the Mathura Road Commercial Area is described as similar to the
Asaf All Road commercial area which 'is fully developed with no room for expansion’ and again as
‘fully commercialized with press and other allied trade buildings built according to bye-laws
applying to the press area’; the FAR of 400 (with ground coverage of 50%) as specified in the Zonal
Development Plan for D-II area can not obviously apply to the press area. During his address he put
the question : How could be the Mathura Road commercial area be fully commercialized even if it is
not fully developed ?

The floor area ratio or FAR is the restriction on the number of floors in a building with reference to
the plot area. The expression 'FAR' is defined in bye-law 2(33) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation
(Buildings) Bye-laws, 1959 in the following terms :

"2. Definitions- In these bye-laws, unless the context otherwise requires :

(33) floor Area Ratio or FAR means the quotient obtained by dividing the multiple of
the total of the covered area on all floors and 100 by the area of the plot i.e. FAR Total covered area of all floors x 100 Plot area”

Where FAR is not specified in the Master Plan which admittedly is the case in regard to press area
on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, the only bye-law applicable would be bye-laws 21 and 22. Bye-law 21
(1) reads :

"21. Maximum height of buildings :- (1) Except with the permission in writing of the
commissioner, and subject to the provisions contained in bye-Law 19, no building
shall be erected or raised to a greater height than seventy feet as measured from the
level of the centre of the adjacent portion of the nearest street. Note : This bye-law
shall be applicable only to those buildings which are not otherwise governed by FAR
wherever specified in the Master Plan."

This bye-law restricts the height of a building to 70 feet. Now, this height is to be measured from the
centre of the adjacent portion of the 'nearest street’. Admittedly, as is clear from the sanction plan,
the height of the new Express Building is about 47 feet (see section plan of the sanction plan: 1"= 8
ft.), the adjacent portion which is the service road is on level with the plinth of the additional
construction. Taking Mathura Road as the ‘nearest street’, the level of Mathura Road stretches from
2 ft. to 5 ft. higher than the plinth level of the additional construction. In any view of the matter, the
additional construction could therefore be permissible if it did not exceed a height of 63 feet. This is
because of bye-law 21(1) and also because of FAR with which is linked the ground floor coverage is
not specified in the Master Plan. Bye-law 22 further restricts the maximum height of a building

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 107Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

permissible under bye-law 21 and it, insofar as material, provides :
"22. Maximum height of buildings with reference to width of streets:
Subject to the provisions of bye-laws 19 & 31, the maximum height of any building
abutting on to any street shall be regulated by the width of such street as follows :

(iv) when the width of the street is 40 ft. Or more, the maximum height shall be the
width of the street;

Note : This bye-law shall be applicable only to those buildings which are not
otherwise governed by floor area ratios wherever specified."

Even though the maximum height of 70 feet is specified in bye-law 21, in order to avoid congestion
the maximum height is further restricted under bye-law 22 in proportion to the width of the
abutting street. In the instant case, Mathura Road which is the abutting street measures in width
150 feet (see the sketch plan of Zonal Development Plan for D-II area). This is apart from the
immediately abutting service road which, even if reckoned as an abutting street, is 63 feet in width.
Therefore, applying bye-law 22(4) read with bye-law 21(1), it is the service road of the street that
governs the height of the buildings in the press area as well as the number of floors, the minimum
floor height being already specified in bye-law 19. The restriction on the height of buildings is
therefore governed by the width of the street subject to the maximum height of 70 feet and this is
the measure adopted where FAR for a particular area is not specified in the Master Plan.

The learned counsel then adverts to the further description with reagard to the Mathura Road
commercial area, namely, that the press and other allied trade buildings have been constructed
according to building bye- laws applying to 'built up areas’. According to him these bye-laws
according to which the buildings have been erected were to apply to ‘built up areas’ so that the net
result is that the Mathura Road commercial area was fully commercialized and has been built up
according to the relevant bye-laws which controlled the construction of commercially built- C up
area. He contends that the description contain a declaration that the whole area was a commercial
area and that it was fully commercialized and the relevant bye-law applicable to the Mathura Road
commercial area was and is bye-law 25(2)(IV-B) which puts a ceiling on FAR at 300. It is next
contended that since the Mathura Road commercial area was a fully developed and commercial area
built up according to the relevant bye-laws, it has not been declared to be a ‘development area’
under s.12(1) of the Act. Sub-s.(2) thereof forbids the Delhi Development Authority to undertake or
carry out development of any land in an area which is not a development area and therefore the
matter falls to be governed by sub-s.(3) which forbids development of land except with the approval
or sanction of the local authority i.e. the Municipal Building Bye-laws applicable to 'built up areas’
which evidently refers to bye-law 25(2)(IV-B). The relevant provisions of bye-law 25 provide as
follows :

"25. Permissible covered area : (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in these bye- laws no
building shall be erected or allowed to be erected in contravention of the Master Plan or any Zonal

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 108Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Development Plan.

(2) The following provisions shall apply to buildings in different use zones IV. Commercial and
Retail Zones :

A.Minto Road and Ranjit Singh Road area.

B. Already built-up commercial areas as indicated in the Master Plan or such other areas as may be
declared commercial areas by the appropriate authority from time to time.

(a) Coverage :

The maximum permissible coverage shall be subject to the provisions of bye-laws 26 & 27 and the
requirement of the FAR as provided in sub-Cl.(b) below.

(b) F.A.R:

The FAR shall not exceed in the case of building having the storeys mentioned in column 1 below by
the figure mentioned in column 2 below :
1 2
Two sroreys 150
Three storeys 200
Four storey 250
More than Four storeys 300
(c) STOREYS :

The number of storeys shall be subject to the provisions of bye-law 22 relating to the maximum
height, of bye-law 31(1) 6 (2) relating to air and light planes and the provisions that the FAR does
not exceed 300". The contention put forward by learned counsel for respondent NO. 1 is that there
are two important factors governing construction of buildings viz. the ground floor coverage and the
FAR. Normally, for all commercial buildings, the ground floor coverage is 25%. However, under
bye-law 26 read with the note appended thereto, as amended in 1964, for certain commercial
buildings ground floor coverage of 80% is permitted. He relies upon the relevant portion of bye-law
26 which reads ;

"26. Open specs in Commercial and Public Buildings
No commercial or public building or ground of such buildings in any bazar, market or commercial
area shall have a ground floor covered area of that 80 per cent of the area of the plot........

Note : This bye-law shall be applicable only to buildings covered by bye-law 25(2) (IV-B) . He
accordingly contends that all buildings in the press area including the new Express Building have a
ground coverage of 80% under bye-law 26 and to such buildings bye-law 25(2)(IV- B) which limits
the FAR to 300 is applicable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 109Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

The fallacy of the argument of the learned counsel lies in the assumption that all buildings in the
press area including the Express Buildings are constructed with a ground coverage of not more than
80% under bye-law 26 and therefore only bye-law 25(2)(IV-B) which limits the FAR to 300 is
applicable in this case. The contention overlooks the note appended to bye-law 26 which reads:

"This bye-law shall be applicable only to buildings covered by bye-law 25(2) (IV-B). Bye-law
25(2)(IV-B) only applies to : 'already built-up commercial areas as indicated in the Master Plan or
such other areas as may be declared as commercial areas by the appropriate authority from time to
time’. As already stated, the expression ‘already built-up commercial area’ as defined in the Master
Plan at pp.60-61 refers to the walled city of Delhi like Chandni Chowk, etc. The list of already
built-up commercial areas admittedly does not include the press area on the Mathura Road.

The matter can also to viewed from another angle. At the time of construction of buildings in the
press area, there were no restrictions as to the FAR along the Mathura Road and the only restriction
on construction of such buildings was that the allottees of the plots in the press area should
construct buildings upto a height of 60 ft. me petitioners constructed the old Express Building to the
east of the sewer line with an FAR of 260 with reference to the entire plot leased to them i.e. plots
nos. 9 and 10 although the building occupied only half of the area. After construction of the old
Express Building to the east of the sewer line in March 1958, the perpetual lease was executed on
March 17, 1958. me supplemental lease was also executed in November 1964. These documents were
in conformity with the agreement for lease entered into on May 26, 1954. The said building was to
be constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications as had been previously proposed and
submitted by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. and approved of in writing by the Chief
Commissioner of Delhi which permitted construction by the petitioners of a building on the entire
area of plots nos. 9 and 10 with 100% ground coverage as stated above.

After the discovery of the underground sewer pipeline by the petitioners which was a fact only
within the knowledge of the Central Government and had not been disclosed to the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. at any time, the parties entered into negotiations for modification of the
agreement. It was agreed between the parties that in view of the drain running through the plots and
till the drain was not diverted, the petitioners would construct their building only to the east of the
drain and in such a way as to leave the drainage system unaffected. The petitioners were thus
disabled from building on a substantial part of the land allotted to them until the underground drain
was realigned outside the boundary of the leasehold premises. In effect, an area of 2740 square
yards to the west of the drain had to be left as a residual piece of land out of the total area of 5703 sq.
yards. It is pertinent to observe that all other newspapers like the Times of India, Patriot, National
Herald etc. who had been granted similar: plots on the Mathura Road on same conditions and were
allowed to build on the entire area of their respective plots without any restrictions whatever. After
further negotiations, the lease agreement was entered into between the parties on November 27,
1957 80 as to protect the underground sewer drain and restrict the construction of the building to
the east of the drain. J.N. Ambegaokar, Under Secretary to the Ministry of Works & Housing by his
letter dated April 11, 1956 confirmed that the allotment of land to the Indian Express Newspapers on
the Mathura Road had been revised on the terms set out therein. The revised allotment was subject,
among others, to the following conditions :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 110Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

1. An area of 2740 sq. yards to the west of the pipeline was allotted on a premium @
Rs. 36,000 per acre plus 2.5% annual ground rent thereon. The said area was to be
maintained as an open space i.e. lying vacant for parking space.

2. The remaining area of 2965 sq. yards to the east of the pipeline was settled on a
premium @ Rs. 1,25,000 per acre plus 2.5% annual ground rent thereon.

The Central Government reserved to themselves the right to divert the sewer line passing through
the leasehold premises.

The effect of the revised terms as per Ambegaokar's letter was that the area to the east of the sewer
line measuring 2965 sq. yards was treated as buildable plot and the remaining area of 2740 sq.yards
treated as non-buildable plot. In respect of the buildable plot there was admittedly 100% coverage
with five floors i.e. an assumed FAR of 500 as in those days there were no building bye-laws or
restrictions providing for an FAR. But actually the old Express Building was built with an FAR of
260. Significantly, a separate ground rent and separate premium was chargeable for the buildable
plot on which the old Express Building stood @ Rs. 1,25,000 per acre and a ground rent of 2.5%.
The lessor i.e. the Union of India left with the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. the area to the west of
the drain measuring 2740 sq.yards on a reduced premium @ Rs. 36,000 per acre and a ground rent
@ 2.5% thereof. It was evidently not within the contemplation of the parties that the area 80 kept
was to be kept green in perpetuity i.e. an area which could not be built upon under any
circumstances because the premium chargeable therefor was @ Rs. 4,840 per acre.

It must therefore be held that the permission granted by Sikander Bakht, the then Minister for
Works & Housing for the construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360
with a double basement for installation of the printing press was not in violation of the Master Plan
for Delhi or the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area or the Delhi Municipal Corporation
(Buildings) Bye-laws, 1959 inasmuch as ex facie bye-law 26 read with 25(2)(IV-B) was not
applicable to the press area on the Mathura Road. Admittedly, the Master Plan does not prescribe
any FAR for the press enclave. The Zonal Development Plan for the first time prescribed FAR for the
four commercial areas for general business and commercial areas, namely : (1) Asaf Ali Road
Commercial Area (2) Minto Road Commercial Area (3) Mathura Road Commercial Area, and (4)
Circular Road Commercial Area (opposite the Ramlila Ground). All these commercial areas fall
within D-II area for which the Zonal Development Plan prescribes an FAR of 400. Validity of the
show cause notice dated March 1, 1980 issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone,
Municipal Corporation, Delhi under as. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.

At the Press Conference convened by respondent no.2 on March 1, 1980, he handed over a press
release alleging that the additional building put up by petitioner no.1, Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.,
was in contravention of law and inter alia it was stated that the Municipal Corporation had been
advised to take immediate action in regard to the unauthorized deviations from the sanctioned plan.
On the same day. the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal Corporation, Delhi served a
notice to petitioner .1 to show cause why action should not be taken for demolition of the structures
set out therein under as 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. The objected

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 111Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

portions of construction in terms of the impugned show cause notice are as under :

" (1) Construction of an upper basement without sanction or, in other words, a
working platform or installations of the machinery; and (2) Unauthorized
construction of an excess basement beyond sanction.

The three alleged unauthorized constructions are :
(a) A triangular pit dug in front of the building;
(b) A left working platform in the basement; and
(c) The basement beyond the plinth area of the new building.

Each of these structures was specifically approved by the Delhi Development Authority as per ‘usual
norms'.

Section 53(3)(a) of the Delhi Development Act provides, inter alia, that :
53(3). Notwithstanding anything contained in such other law 
(a) when permission for development in respect of any Land has been obtained under
this Act such development shall not be deemed to be unlawfully undertaken or
carried out by reason only of the fact that permission, approval or sanction required
under such other law for such development ‘has not been obtained."

The words ‘such other law' within their amplitude include a Law like the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act and the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Buildings) Bye-laws, 1959 framed
thereunder. The non- obstante clause in s. 53(A)(i) clearly gives an overriding effect to the sanction
granted by the Delhi Development Authority for the construction of the new Express Building with
an increased FAR of 360 and a double basement for installation of printing press or the working
platform. the effect of grant of such permission by the Authority was to modify the sanctioned plans
of the Municipal Corporation to that extent. That apart, the terms 'development' as defined in s.2(d)
of the Act includes the carrying out of buildings...... in, on, over or under land in any building etc.
and in wide enough to include the structures in question. As the Authority approved each of these
structures for which the impugned show cause notice had been issued by the Zonal Engineer
(Building), City Zone, Municipal Corporation, it is clear that he had acted beyond his authority and
power.

The impugned notice alleges that a basement was under construction in the triangular portion of the
plot. In fact, the alleged construction was not a basement at all. The circumstances under which the
triangular pit came into existence has been explained by the petitioners. It appears that while the
under-ground sewage drain was being diverted, it burst and water from the drain flooded the entire
pit that had been dug for the foundation of the building and they allege that water had reached 14 ft.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 112Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

in height and it endangered the foundation of the original Express Building. The service road
parallel to Bahadurshah Zafar Marg was also in imminent danger of caving in. Petitioner no.1 had
therefore to build supporting walls which became a storage tank. The construction of walls in the
triangular area was meant to strengthen and re-enforce the foundation of the original building as
well as to prevent the road from caving in. What alleged in the show cause notice as a proposed
basement under construction was merely for fortuitous construction necessitated by the drain
flooding the pit and now it is merely meant to house a water static tank needed for fire fighting
purposes. Such fire fighting arrangement is necessary to prevent fire hazard which inflicted huge
losses in various multi-storeyed buildings like Kanchunjunga and the Hindustan Times buildings.
The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. further allege that they were advised by the fire- brigade
authorities to construct a static tank.

It would, therefore, appear that 'excess basement is in two parts :

"(1)So much of the excess basement as was the result of subsidence of 8000 sq. ft. of
land caused by bursting of a part of the sewer line while it was being shifted. The
petitioner no. 1 built supporting walls which became a storage tank and it covers an
area of 4,500 sq. ft.

(2) Underground tunnel, meant for use as a passage for labour and movement of
news-print from the old to the new Express Building and it measures 450 sq. ft.

The Municipal Corporation is treating this storage tank as an unauthorized construction. It was got
deleted from the sanctioned plan because in the original plan there was a provision for a smaller
water tank. Ultimately, the objection is to a bigger storage tank.

There is no dispute that all the structures are below the ground. The main purpose of the upper
basement i.e. a working platform measuring 6000 sq. ft. was meant to work the printing press.
Without the water storage tank the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. would not get the completion
certificate and it is difficult to understand how the underground tunnel passage, to connect the old
and new Express Building would cause traffic hazard. At any rate, such minor deviation would not
result in a demolition of the Express Buildings. The manner in which the impugned notice was got
issued by the Municipal Corporation at the direction of respondent No. 2 shows that it was done
with an ulterior purpose. The illegality of the action is writ large and the manner in which it wag
done creates a ground for belief that the action was motivated.

The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. were asked to show cause within three days from the date of issue
of the notice as to why an order of demolition should not be passed under sub-s. (1) of s.343 failing
which action was to be taken for demolition under sub-ss. (2) and (3) of s. 344. It is evident from
the list of dates furnished by the learned counsel for the Municipal Corporation that during the
period from February 18, 1980 to the date of issue of the impugned notice, the officials of the
Municipal Corporation had been waiting upon respondent no. 2, holding inspection of the premises
and directly reporting to him in respect of the alleged deviations. It is alleged that the second
basement was not in the sanctioned plan which measured 8914 sq. ft. (according to petitioners it

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 113Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

measured only about 6000 sq. ft.) and the excess basement over the sanctioned basement works out
to 5450 sq. ft. and of which the water storage tank measures 4095 sq. ft. and the under-ground
tunnel measures about 500 sq. ft. and, therefore, ss. 343 and 344 of the Act were attracted.

The contention of learned counsel appearing for the Municipal Corporation is that the Express
Newspapers Pvt. ltd. have been guilty of suppressio veri as they have not mentioned the fact that on
the objection of the Municipal Authorities, they deleted all the aforementioned three portions set
out in the notice. It was urged that the construction of these structures was admittedly carried on in
violation of the sanctioned plan. It was pointed out that the tank as recommended by the Chief Fire
Officer by his letter dated January 5, 1979 was for the construction of an underground water storage
tank over the area of 550 sq. ft. for the requirement of fire fighting and fire protection measures. It
was, however, asserted that the recommendation of the Chief Fire Officer was not according to
building bye- laws and, therefore, not binding on the Municipal Corporation. The proposal for the
construction of a water storage tank in a corner of the building covering 550 sq. ft. was accordingly
got deleted. It was also pointed out that the water storage tank as constructed measuring 4095 sq. ft.
was eight times bigger than the one recommended by the Chief fire Officer. I am afraid, I am unable
to appreciate this line of reasoning. If a water tank of this magnitude was permitted to be
constructed, the water stored in it would be sufficient for the entire Press Enclave at Bahadurshah
Zafar Marg. I fail to see any rational basis for the objection raised. The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
have at a considerable cost, constructed a large enough water storage tank to serve the entire Press
Enclave and if it is sufficient to serve all the buildings on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, the Municipal
Corporation should, indeed, thank the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. for making provision for the
protection of all the buildings. In the recent past, the devastating fire which engulfed many
multi-storeyed buildings like Hindustan Times, Kanchunjunga, Gopala Tower etc. showed that the
authorities could not bring under control such fires for want of sufficient water facilities.

S. 14 of the Delhi Development Act which applies to all areas in Delhi irrespective of whether such
area is a development or non-development area or a slum area, lays down that the use of the land
shall be in accordance with the plan, i.e., in conformity with the Master Plan and Zonal
Development Plan. m e Press Area falls within the 'Use Zone' C-II which is dealt with at page 50 of
the Printing Master Plan. It is evident from the uses as specified for the said zone that installation of
printing machinery for production of newspaper has to be specially permitted by the Delhi
Development Authority 'under Special Appeal’ provision laid down in the Master-Plan read with s.
14 of the Act. It is in pursuance of these statutory provisions that the letter dated November 4, 1478
of the Joint Director (Building), Delhi Development Authority was addressed to the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd., inter alia permitting the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to instal in the
basement printing press machinery like any other service machiney. It is apparent from the building
plan that the Delhi Development Authority approved of the same with the second basement ‘as per
norms of ground coverage and F.A.R.' and the permitted second basement of 14,440 sq. ft. However,
it appears that the Municipal Corporation while granting sanction to the building plan on January 9,
1979, got deleted the basement beyond plinth line as well as the second basement with the
observations that 'it in no manner overpowers the authority of the Delhi Development Authority or
any other person or body’. In view of the difficulty created, the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. did not
construct the second basement of 14,440 sq. ft. but limited the construction to a working platform of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 114Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

about 6000 sq. ft.

The Express Newspaper Pvt. Ltd. have specifically averred in sub-paras (a) to (k) or para 33 that the
machines they have planned to instal and which have been specifically permitted to instal in the
basement by the Delhi Development Authority, are of 24 sq. ft. in height from the foundation. This
is the reason why on account of which, the height of the basement has been sanctioned at 26 ft. The
newsreels are fed at the bottom of those machines and the printed matter is collected at the top i.e.
On the second basement for delivery to vans and trucks at the street level. The Express Newspapers
Pvt. Ltd. have produced photographs which show the two levels of the machines that are to be
installed in the basement. One has, therefore, to approach the machines at the bottom to feed the
news-print in and at shoulder level to receive the printed papers as well as to service the machines.
All modern printing presses require a slab or a working platform where the printing paper is
received and from which the machine can be served. The working platform is a necessary
appurtenance which is incidental to and necessary for, the machines to be installed by them. They
further allege that in the Indraprastha Estate itself, buildings of the National Herald, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants, the Times of India and Milap, amongst others, have were than one floor
beneath the ground floor. The construction of these structures has been specifically sanctioned by
the Municipal Corporation. They have placed on record, the sanctioned plans of the Times of India
and the National Herald allowing them to construct such a working platform. The photographs
relating to the Times of India building which is only 300 yards away from the Express Buildings
show that such a platform had been constructed and is in regular use in the Times of India building.
The working platform in the Times of India building is a concrete platform measuring about 6000
sq.ft. The petitioners contend that allowing their competitors to construct such a working platform
and disallowing construction of the platform in the case of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. is
clearly violative of the petitioners' fundamental right to equality before the law guaranteed by Art. 14
of the Constitution. Further, in case the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. are denied the facility of such
a platform, the machinery would be rendered ineffective and this would be a serious infringement of
their fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to carry on any trade or
business guaranteed under Arts. 19(1)(a) and (g) of the Constitution
The petitioners’ case is that the working platform which the respondents wrongly described as a
double basement is incidental to and absolutely essential for the machines. The choice before them
was to construct it with wood, tin or R.C.C. slab. They preferred to build it in R.C.C. A working
platform made of wood would have been a serious fire hazard. Beneath it, at given time almost the
entire basement would be stacked with news-print reels which are highly combustible. The ink a
large stock of which has also to be stored in the basement is also highly combustible. Moreover, the
number of electric wires and connections is 80 large that it could not run the risk of a wooden
platform. Finally, if wooden platform was constructed, considering the heavy loads it would have to
bear, would have required frequent and extensive maintenance. A working platform of steel would
have presented similar problems; it is a conductor of electricity and hence a hazard to the workmen
and it would have been extremely noisy which would have required frequent and extensive
maintenance. Thus, from all points of view, those of safety, G economy and efficiency, the
petitioners cast a R.C.C. slab as being more appropriate for the needs of the Press. From the
photographs on record, it is quite apparent that the printing press is a heavy machinery which is

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 115Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

installed on the lower basement with a height of 24 ft.

The petitioners have alleged that in the Indraprastha Estate itself, buildings of the National Herald,
Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Times of India and Milap, amongst others, have more than
one floor beneath the ground floor. The construction of these structures has been specifically
sanctioned by the Municipal Corporation.

The petitioners contend that the slab of the working platform constructed by them does not fall
within the meaning of the expression ‘covered area’ in sub-cl.(22) of cl.2 of the Building Bye-laws,
since it is below the plinth level. There is, therefore, no addition to the covered area at all. The Delhi
Development Authority which granting sanction clearly stated that the area of the basement would
not be included in the calculation of F.A.R. The petitioners also contend that the erection of such a
platform does not fall within the meaning of the expression 'to erect a building’ which is defined in a.
331 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act to mean to erect or re-erect a building and hence no
sanction is required for the same. The Delhi Development Authority specifically approved
construction of double basement as per the plan approved by it and in terms of s.53(3) of the Delhi
Development Act, such approval has an overriding effect, and, therefore; the Zonal Engineer
(Building) acted beyond his authority in issuing the impugned notice under ss. 343 and 344 of the
Act.

As already stated, the petitioners have clearly averred that such a working platform exists not only in
the old Indian Express building but also in the Times of India and the National Herald buildings,
amongst others, in the press Enclave and this has not been denied by the Municipal Corporation. In
fact, the answer is building plan of the Times of India was sanctioned before the Corporation itself
had come into existence i.e. in 1957, when in fact, the building plan of the Times of India was
sanctioned in the year 1962. Similarly, the building plan of the National Herald was sanctioned in
the year 1964. It is difficult to believe that the Municipal Corporation is not aware that such a
working platform is absolutely essential and is necessary for the printing press. If the upper
basement of the working platform constructed by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. is demolished,
the installation of the printing press itself in the lower basement with the sanction of the Delhi
Development Authority under the appropriate statutory provision would be nullified and the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. would not be in a position to operate the printing press at all.

The contention of the learned counsel appearing for the Municipal Corporation is that under the
Master Plan and the Building Bye-laws, not more than one basement is permissible and that any
basement more than one will have to be reckoned for the purpose of FAR appears to be only
mis-conceived. It is evident from page 16 of the Printed Master Plan and the Zonal Development
Plan for D-II area at pages 935 and 936 that semi-basement, meaning a second basement is
permissible under the Master-Plan as well as the Zonal Development Plan. The Bye-laws of the
Delhi Municipal Corporation do not prohibit second basement and on the contrary bye-law 54 uses
the term 'basements’. In respect of commercial zone in Minto Road in Ranjit Singh Road, bye-law 25
(2) (IV) specifically provides for a semi-basement. Our attention was drawn to the statement of the
Minister for Works & Housing made in the Parliament on November 5, 1982, showing that in the
Meridian Hotel, a 5-Star hotel, sponsored by M/s. Pure Drinks not only two basements have been

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 116Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

permitted but also a semi- basement and a service floor without reckoning any one of them for
computation of FAR. Further, the advertisements issued by the Delhi Development Authority for
auctioning hotel sites at Bhikaji Cama Place and New Friends Colony show that the double
basements are permissible and have, in fact, been permitted in the case of these hotels.

It is urged that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. have no right to construct the upper basement
particularly when the Corporation refused to accord sanction to it and that, in any event, it was not
such an unavoidable necessity as to break the law. It is said that the second basement, conveniently
called, the working platform for the operation of flouncing of the printed newspaper is just an
afterthought. He argued that even i some receiving floor may perhaps be necessary to receive the
printed newspaper from the machine, it could be achieved by locating the machines on a suitable
pedestal or by laying the floor of the basement in such a manner as to discharge the newspapers on
the ground floor. It is difficult to conceive how the huge printing press with a height of 24 ft. could
be placed on a pedestal or be laid on the floor of the basement in such a manner as to discharge the
newspapers on the ground floor. It is common ground that there is a working platform in all the
other printing press in the same line of buildings like that of the Times of India, the National
Herald, Patriot and the old Indian Express Building. In all these buildings, the printing presses are
installed in the lower basement and there is an over-hanging platform in the printing press in each
of the buildings to receive the printed material. I do not see any justification for the Municipal
Corporation to object to the construction of the working platform. If the Municipal Bye-laws do not
permit the construction of a double basement then they would be clearly violative of Art. 14, 19(1)
(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Shri M.C. Bhandare, learned counsel appearing for respondent nos. 3 and 4, Municipal Corporation
of Delhi and Zonal Engineer (Building, City Zone, Municipal Corporation, Delhi is fair enough to
state that if the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. were to make an application for modification of the
sanctioned plan pertaining to the new building with respect to the basement and the working
platform which according to the Municipal Corporation constitute double basements and the
inter-connecting underground passage connecting the existing Indian Express Building the same
shall be considered having regard to consideration of justice and the needs of the petitioners and
also taking into consideration that the new building has been constructed for installing a printing
press and that the press so installed cannot function without the working platform which the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. have already constructed, as well as the fact that the underground
passage has been constructed by them for inter-connecting the new building with the existing Indian
Express Building. He further states that the Municipal Corporation will compound the deviation
which is minimum on payment of such composition fee as is payable under the bye-laws.

Learned counsel states that this shall not be treated as precedent for others.

Applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel : In my considered opinion the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. having acted upon the grant of permission by Sikandar Bakht the then
Minister for Works & Housing and constructed the new Express Building with an increased FAR of
360 and a double basement in conformity with the permission granted by the lessor i.e. the Union of
India, Ministry of Works & Housing with the concurrence of the Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 117Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

Authority on the amalgamation of plots nos. 9 and 10, as ordered by the Vice-Chairman by his order
dated October 21, 1978 as on 'special appeal’ as envisaged in the Master Plan having been directed,
the lessor is clearly precluded from contending that the order of the Minister was illegal, improper
or invalid by application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

In 1948, Denning, J. in Robertson v. Minister of Pensions, L.R., [19491 1 K.B. 227, laid the
foundation to the applicability of promissory estoppel in public law. As Prof. de Smith in his Judicial
Review of Administrative Action, 4th edition at p.103 observes :

"There is a growing body of authority, attributable in large part to the efforts of Lord
Denning, to the effect that in some circumstances when public bodies and officers, in
their dealing with a citizen, take it upon themselves to assume authority on a matter
concerning him, the citizen is entitled to rely on their having the authority that they
have asserted if he cannot reasonably be expected to know the limits of that
authority; and he should not be required to suffer for his reliance if they lack the
necessary authority.

The learned author then states :

"But it is extremely difficult to define with any degree of precision the circumstances
in which the courts will be prepared, in the interest of 'fairness' to the individual to
derogate from orthodox notion of ultra vires.

Professor H.W.R. Wade in Administrative Law, 5th edition, at page 232 observes that the basic
principle of estoppel is that a person who by some statement or representation of fact cause another
to act to his detriment in reliance on the truth of it is not allowed to deny it later, even though it is
wrong. Justice here prevails over truth. Estoppel is often described as a rule of evidence, but more
correctly it is a principle of law. As a principle of common law it applies only to representations
about past or present facts. But there is also an equitable principle of 'promissory estoppel’ which
can apply to public authorities. The fact in Robertson's case were these. The War Office wrote to
Robertson, an Army Officer, who had claimed a disablement pension on account of the War injury,
that his disability had been accepted as attributable to military service. But for this injury the
responsible department was the Ministry of Pensions which the War Officer had not consulted. The
Ministry later decided that the disability was not attributable and the Pension Appeal Tribunal
upheld that decision. In relying on the War Office letter the claimant had refrained from getting a
medical opinion and adducing the other evidence which might have strengthened his case for such
disability pension against the Ministry. On appeal to the Court, Denning, J. reversed the decisions of
the Ministry and the Tribunal holding that the Crown was bound by the War Office letter and
observe :

"The Crown cannot escape by saying that estoppels do not bind the Crown, for that
doctrine has long been exploded. Nor can the Crown escape by praying in aid the
doctrine of executive necessity, that is, the doctrine that the Crown cannot bind itself
so as to fetter its future executive action. It would appear that Denning, J. evoked two

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 118Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

doctrines :

(1) that assurances intended to be acted upon and in fact acted upon; were binding; and (2) that
where a Government department wrongfully assumes authority to perform some legal act, the
citizen is entitled to assume that it has that authority, and he dismissed the contention that
estoppels do not bind the Crown by saying that 'that doctrine has long been exploded’ and that the
Crown cannot fetter its future executive action. Professor Wade points out that the proposition
about wrongful assumption of authority evoked by Denning , J. was immediately repudiated by the
House of Lords in a later case in which Denning, LJ. had again put it forward in Howell v. Falmouth
Boat Construction Company Ltd., L.R. [1951] A.C. 837, it is beyond the scope of this judgment to
enter into a discussion as to how far Denning J's dictum can still be regarded as part of the common
law in England. But there appears to be a school of thought in India laying down that the doctrine of
promissory estoppel applies to the Government except under certain circumstances.

In Union of India & Ora. v. Indo Afghan Agencies Ltd [1968] 2 S.C.R. 366, Shah, J. speaking for the
Court stated with approval the following observations of Denning, J. in Robertson's case :

"The Crown cannot escape by saying that estoppels do not bind the Crown for that
doctrine has long been exploded. Nor can the Crown escape by praying in aid the
doctrine of executive necessity, that is, the doctrine that the Crown cannot bind itself
so as to fetter its future executive action.

and the learned Judge held that this doctrine applies in India.

In Century Spinning & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. & Anr. v. The Ulhasnagar Municipal Council & Anr.,
[1970] 3 S.C.R. 854, Shah, J. in remanding the petition to the High Court which it had dismissed in
limine again observed :

"In Indo-Afghan's case this Court held that the Government is not exempt from the
equity arising out of the acts done by citizens to their prejudice, relying upon the
representations as to its future conduct made by the Government. This Court held
that the observations made by Denning, J. in Robertson's case applied in India."

The learned Judge observed that the court was not concerned with the principle which was
dis-approved by Lord simonds in Falmouth's case and he added :

"If our nascent democracy is to thrive different standards of conduct for the people
and the public bodies cannot ordinarily be permitted. A public body is, in our
judgment, not exempt from . liability to carry out its obligation arising out of
representations made by it relying upon which a citizen has altered his position to his
prejudice."

In MotiLaL Padampat Sugar Mills Co.(P) Ltd. y. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors., [1979] 2 S.C.R- 641,
Bhagwati, J. speaking for himself and Tulzapurkar, J. laid great stress on the facts that the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 119Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

principles laid down by Denning, J. in Robertson's case were accepted by the Court in the Indo
Afghan's case but accepted the rejection of Lord Simonds and Lord Normands in Falmouth's case of
the extended principles enunciated by Denning, J. in Robertson's case as Laying down the-correct
law. But the learned Judge went down to say that this rejection did not mean that there could be no
estoppel against the Crown or the public authority.

I am not oblivious that there was a discordant note struck by Kailasam, J. speaking for himself and
Fazal Ali, J. in Jit Ram Shiv Kumar & Ors. v. State of Haryana & Anr., [1980] 3 S.C.R. 689, holding
that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked for preventing the Government from
discharging its functions under law. It is also not applicable when the officer and the Government
act out-side the scope of their authority. The doctrine of ultra vise will in that event come into
operation and the government cannot be held bound by the unauthorized acts of his officers.

It is not necessary for purposes of this judgement to solve the apparent conflict between the decision
of the Bhagwati , J. in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills' case as to the applicability of the doctrine of
estoppel for preventing the Government from discharging its functions under the law. In public law,
the most obvious limitation and doctrine of estoppel is that it cannot be evoked 80 as to give an
overriding power which it does not in law possess. In other words, no estoppel can legitimate action
which is ultra vires. Another limitation is that the principle of estoppel does not operate at the level
of Government policy. Estoppels have however been allowed to operate against public authority in
minor matters of formality where no question of ultra vires arises : Wade, Administrative law, 5th
edition, pp. 233-34.

The principles laid down in Maritime Elec. Co. v. General Dairies Ltd., [1937] A.C. 610 P:C., and by
Lord Parker, CJ. in Southend-on Sea-Corporation v. Hodgeson (Wickford) Ltd., [1962] 1 Q.B. 416,
relied upon by learned counsel appearing for respondent no.1 the Union of India are clearly not
attracted in the facts and circumstances of the present case. In the present case, admittedly, the then
Minister for Works & Housing acted within the scope of his authority in granting permission of the
lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to
construct new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for
installation of a printing press for publication of a Hindi newspaper under the Rules of Business
framed by the President under Art. 77(3). Therefore, the doctrine of ultra vires does not come into
operation. In view of this respondent no.1 the Union of India is precluded by the doctrine of
promissory estoppel from questioning the authority of the Minister in granting such permission. In
that view, the successor Government was clearly bound by the decision taken by the Minister
particularly when it had been acted upon.

Quantum of conversion charges : Extent of Liability : Forum of determination.

During the course of hearing, we wanted the parties to clarify the exact legal position. Shri Arun
Jetley appearing for the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. made a statement that the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. sought permission to construct the new Express Building with an FAR of 360
for the purpose of their press only as they intended to start a Hindi daily newspaper from Delhi. He
clarified that the sub-letting of portions thereof in the year 1982 to the Reserve Bank of India and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 120Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

the Steel Authority of India with the permission of the Court was subject to the giving of an
undertaking by the sub-lessees that they would vacate the premises under the orders of the Court,
and this was purely an ad-interim arrangement. He further stated that the Express Newspapers Pvt.
Ltd. in these petitions do not claim to enforce any right to sub-let any part of the new building; and,
if and when they seek to sub-let any part thereof, they would apply to the lessor i.e. the Ministry of
Works & Housing for permission for change of user and pay the necessary additional ground rent
and conversion charges as applicable to others in the Press Enclave situate at Bahadurshah Zafar
Marg.

Dr. L.M. Singhvi appearing for respondent no. 5 , the Land & Development Officer made a
statement that the notice issued by the Engineer Officer dated March 10, 1980 in supersession of his
earlier notice dated March 7, 1980 was issued on behalf bf the Land & Development Officer not
because there was any breach of the terms of the lease by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. by the
construction of a new building with an FAR of 360 together with the existing Indian Express
Building, but because of nonsubmission of the sanctioned plan to the Land & Development Officer
and construction of the new building without the sanction of the lessor i.e. the Union of India. He
clarified that the Land & Development Officer is not an authority competent to question the decision
of the Ministry of Works & Housing to permit construction of the Indian Express Building covering
an FAR of 360. The whole purpose of the. aforesaid notice of the Engineer Officer dated March 10,
1980 sent on behalf of the Land & Development Officer was to realize the amount of Rs. 54,000
which had been refunded on account of the portion kept green being built up and for the purpose of
checking the deviations, if any, from the sanctioned plan.

Undoubtedly, the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. are liable to pay conversion charges in terms of cl.
2(7) of the lease-deed but c the question is : how much is the amount and what should be the basis.
On this vexed question, the submissions advanced furnish no easy solution for us to adjudicate
because it involves technical expertise. According to Shri Nariman, learned counsel for the
petitioners no conversion charges are payable in respect of the new Express Building with an
increased FAR of 360 built on the residual area of 2740 sq. yards as per the circular of the
Government of India, Ministry of Works & Housing dated February 19, 1970 apart from Rs. 54,000
towards additional premium for change of use of the leased land, which was non- buildable
becoming buildable with the removal of the underground sewer-line, and additional ground rent at
2-2/1% of the additional premium. According to him, the distinction now sought to be drawn by
respondent no.5 , Land & Development Officer between conversion of green area to 'newspaper' and
thereafter to commercial is nowhere borne out from any notification, order or even practice of the
Land & Development Office. The only two sets of rates prescribed are for 'residential' and for
‘commercial’ use for newspapers. Newspaper press is, in fact, not a commercial use under the
Master Plan. Even taking the commercialization rate of Rs. 750 per sq.yard for the residual area of
2740 sq.yards at the date of permission for the residual area, the amount works out to 2740 x 1/2 =
11.02 lacs. Upon that basis, out of this, a sum of Rs. 6.9 lacs was admittedly spent by the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. for diverting the sewer to make the land buildable. The rate of
commercialization charges was admittedly Rs. 750 per sq.yards in the press area in the Mathura
Road commercial complex for the period from April 14, 1976 to March 31, 1979 when there was an
upward revision of the said rates. Our attention was drawn to the notification of the Government of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 121Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

India dated May 15, 1974 laying down rates for the period from April 14, 1976 (item 67 relates to the
press area) and the notification dated June 25, 1979 revising the above rates w.e.f. April 9, 1979
(Group 3, item 5 relates to the press area).

It is further submitted that the formula furnished by Dr.Singhvi, learned counsel appearing for
respondent no.2 , the Lt. Governor and respondent no.5 the Land & Development Officer for
computation of conversion charges for change of user is wholly inaccurate. It overlooks the fact that
the commercial charges would be only 50% of the difference between the market value on the date
of conversion and-the premium already paid. That this is the correct formula is disclosed by the
Government to Parliament. According to the formula, only 50% of the difference between the
current market value on the date of conversion and the premium paid previously is payable as
additional premium to the Government and not 100% of the said difference, as asserted. The
learned counsel submits that in view of the stand taken by the Land & Development Officer who
evidently has mis- stated vital facts and tried to mislead the Court the petitioners cannot hope any
kind of justice at his hands.

Shri Nariman further contends that although by reason of the circular of the Government of India
dated February 19, 1970 whereunder the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. were not bound to pay any
premium for additional construction in respect of the lease granted (even where the actual leasedeeds are no executed), nevertheless, they are prepared to pay whatever amount that this Court may
teem fit as and by way of commercial charges in order to avoid another round of litigation.
Alternatively, they were prepared as they have always been ant what was stated at the very opening
day of the hearing of this case, to have this question of quantum of conversion charges terminated
by an impartial ant independent person like a retired Judge of the Supreme Court named by this
Court, to which the respondents were not agreeable. Since there is no administrative or statutory
remedy provided, he prayed that the Court may direct payment of such amount, if any as may be
deemed just and proper particularly having regard to the fact that even if the open land of 2740
sq.yards were allotted for the first time in 1978 to a particular person for commercial purpose, the
only charge that can be levied would be market rate of Rs. 750 per sq.yards i.e. aggregate of Rs.
22.05 lacs. Of this only 50%, namely, Rs. 11.02 lacs is recoverable by the lessor i.e. the Union of
India, Ministry of Works & Housing as per norms.

The Land & Development Officer hat filed a note that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. did not and
have not come to him with sanctioned plan of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi ant were now
seeking to avoid a monetary liability arising from their real intention of turning the new Express
Building into a real estate venture by grossing nearly a crore of rupees of rental per month by means
of this writ petition. It is stated that the liability of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. now is
enormous because of commercial sub-letting instead of newspaper use. They have not yet applied to
the lessor and as and when they to, they would be liable to pay conversion charges at the prevailing
rates. That would obviously come to a amount much larger than Rs. 50,425 tendered by the Express
Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. by cheque dated September 21, 1982 because of admitted commercial
sub-letting. He stated that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. would have to pay a large amount of
money as subletting charges as permission for FAR of 360 though illegally given, was accorded only
for newspaper use. The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. therefore stand to gain crores of rupees in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 122Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

rental income at the rate of Rs. 16 per sq.ft. per month from the huge additional constriction. If ant
when permission is granted under the lease they would have to make at least one lumpsum payment
to the lessor who owns the land in addition to further additional ground rent. It is accordingly stated
that the Court should extend no assistance to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. from avoiding the
norms and procedure for obtaining the sanction of the lessor i.e. by applying to Land &
Development Officer and from evading payment of charges uniformly levied. Further if the original
declared 'real and genuine intention' of using the space for its newspaper was adhered to by the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. their monetary liability would be very small.

The Land & Development Officer further asserts that the petitioners apprehended. that if their real
intention of commercial sub-letting were to be disclosed, they would have had to make payment and
comply with the terms which they wanted to evade ant avoid. That is why instead of complying with
the notice of the Engineer Officer dated March 10, 1980, the petitioners moved this Court through
the present writ petitions on April 1, 1980 alleging breach of their fundamental rights under
Art.19(1) (a), Art. 14 ant Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution ant obtained at-interim ex- parte stay on
April 7, 1980. It was clear from the writ petitions that by the end of February, 1980 the entire
structure of the new Express Building except the small portion were completed at a cost of
approximately Rs. 1.30 crores.

While accepting that the conversion charges for the new Express Building build on the residual area
of 2740 sq. yards utilized for newspapers use would amount to Rs. 54,000, the Land Development
Officer has also "without prejudice" to the rights and contentions of the respondents tentatively
worked out the conversation charges as indicated in the following chart :

1. Conversion charges for changing use of 2740 sq. yards of open area from green to
buildable area for Newspaper Press, the purpose for ‘which plot nos.9 and 10 were
allotted as per original allotment and Perpetual Lease.

Total area to be kept vacant 2740 sq. yards, as per perpetual lease cl.2(14) =0.566 acres Conversion
charges now to be recovered for construction of additional building on the open area for starting a
Newspaper = Area of vacant land now permitted to be built up x (concessional rate for newspapers Rate for land to be kept open already charged) The concessional rate applicable for newspaper use
for all press plots in Mathura Road i.e. Rs. 1.25 lacs per acre and the vacant land in plots 9 and 10
was charged at Rs. 36,000 per acre.

2. Additional ground rate (AGR)
payable per annum on this
account = Conversion charges )
)x 2-1/2
for green space )

Arrears of A.G.R. from 1978 to 1983 (five years) plus interest.

Dr. Singhvi appearing for respondent no.5 , Land & Development Officer submits that unless the
Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. furnished the Municipal Corporation of Delhi the sanctioned plans

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 123Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

asked for in the impugned notice, it is not possible to work out the conversion charges and other
charges and submit the same for approval to the Ministry of Works & Housing and after receipt of
their approval to intimate the same to the lessee i.e. the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. According to
the learned counsel a rough estimate of the charges payable by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. On
the basis of the date available with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi was arrived at as given in the
chart given above, if commercial sub-letting were to be permitted. On the basis of the calculations
therein the estimated conversion charges come to approximately Rs. 3.30 crores. The learned
counsel also stated that on the admitted position the only rental @ 16 5 per sq.ft. per month
collected by the Express Newspapers Pvt.Ltd. would be Rs. One crore per year approximately.

We cannot possibly in these proceedings under Art.32 under- take an adjudication of this kind but I
am quite clear that respondent no.5 the Land & Development Officer having already indicated his
mind that the amount of conversion charges would be more than Rs. 3.30 crores, it would not
subserve the interests of justice to leave the adjudication of a question of such magnitude to the
arbitrary decision of the Land & Development Officer who is a minor functionary of the Ministry of
Works & Housing. We were informed by Shri Sinha, learned counsel for respondent no.1, the Union
of India that the Central Government were contemplating to undertake a legislation and to provide
for a‘forum for adjudication of such disputes. As stated earlier, we had suggested that the dispute as
to the quantum of conversion charges payable be referred to the arbitration of an impartial person
like a retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India, but this was not acceptable to the respondents.
The Union of India may in the contemplated legislation provide for the setting up of a tribunal with
a right of appeal, may be to the District Judge or the High Court, to the aggrieved party. If such a
course is not feasible, the only other alternative for the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of
Works & Housing would be to realize the conversion charges and additional ground rent, whatever
be recoverable, by a duly constituted suit. Till then I would restrain the Union of India, Ministry of
Works & Housing and the Land & Development Officer or any other officer of the Ministry from
taking any steps for termination of the lease held by petitioner no.1, Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
for non-payment of conversion charges or otherwise for the construction of the Express Building till
the final determination of such amount to be realized by a statutory tribunal or by a Civil Court.

For these reasons, I would, therefore, for my part, quash the impugned notices.

The result therefore is that these petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution must succeed and are
allowed with costs. The notice issued by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office dated
March 10, 1980 purporting to act on behalf of the Government of India, Ministry of Works &
Housing requiring the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the lessor i.e. the Union of
India, Ministry of Works & Housing should not re enter upon and take possession of plots nos. 9
and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi together with the Express Building built thereon,
under cl.5 of the indenture of lease dated March 17, 1958 for alleged breaches of cls. 2(5) and 2(14)
thereof, and the earlier notice dated March 1, 1980 issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), City
Zone, Municipal Corporation, Delhi requiring them to show cause why the aforesaid buildings
should not be demolished under 88. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, are
quashed. It is declared that the construction of the new Express Building on the residual portion of
2740 square yards on the western side of plots nos. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg with an

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 124Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for installation of a printing press for publication of a
Hindi daily newspaper was with the permission of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of
Works & Housing and did not constitute a breach of clauses 2(5) and 2(14) of the lease-deed.

It is directed that the respondents, particularly the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing,
the Delhi Development Authority, and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, shall forbear from giving
effect to the impugned notices in the manner threatened or in any other manner whatsoever. It is
further directed that the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing shall enforce its claim for
recovery of conversion charges by a duly constituted suit or by making a law prescribing a forum for
adjudication of its claim. It is also directed that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi shall compound
the construction of the double basement of the new Express Building, the excess basement beyond
the plinth limit and the underground passage on payment of the usual composition fee.

The petitioners shall be entitled to recover their costs from respondents nos. 1 and 2.

VENKATARAMIAH, J. I have gone through the judgment which my learned Brother Justice A.P.
Sen has just now delivered. I agree that Shri Jagmohan, Lt. Governor of Delhi, the second
respondent herein, has taken undue interest in getting the impugned notices issued to the Ist
petitioner and his action which has come up for consideration in this case is not consistent with the
normal standards of administration. I am satisfied that the said notices were issued by the
authorities concerned under the pressure of the second respondent. The question whether the
notices should be issued or not does appear to have been considered independently by the
concerned administrative authorities before issuing them. Shri Lal Narain Sinha, the learned
counsel for the Union Government has submitted that the Lt. Governor was a total stranger to the
lease and had no sort of right or power under the lease deed to set in motion any action against the
lessees. He has further submitted that the land leased under the lease deed being nazul land is
exclusively owned by the Union Government ant the powers delegated to the former Chief
Commissioner of Delhi under the lease deed were no longer exercisable by the present Lt. Governor
of Delhi. Shri Lal Narain Sinha, learned counsel for the Union of India, specifically stated that on the
date on which action was initiated in this case by the Lt. Governor against the petitioners, the Lt.
Governor had acted without authority or power. The clam of the Lt. Governor that he was the agent
of the Union Government in regard to the lease in question and that he could take the steps he had
taken under the lease thus stands repudiated. It is unfortunate that the Lt. Governor persisted in
justifying his action even after the learned counsel for the Union of India had disowned all the
actions of the Lt. Governor. The Lt. Governor failed to make a distinction in this case between the
power with respect to the subject 'Property of the Union and the revenue therefrom' which is in
Entry 32 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the general powers of
administration entrusted to him under Article 239 of the Constitution as the Administrator of the
Union Territory of Delhi. The property in question is a part of the estate of the Central Government.
Mere nearness to the seat of the Central Government does not clothe the Lt. Governor of Delhi with
any power in respect of the property of the Central Government. He can discharge only those powers
which are entrusted to him by the Constitution and the laws.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 125Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

It is also not correct to claim that all the powers of the former Chief Commissioner of Delhi have
devolved on the Lt. Governor and continue to vest in him. It is surprising that the Land and
Development office which is under the Central Government, functioned in this case as an office
under the Lt. Governor of the Union Territory of Delhi and even in the conduct of this case it
allowed itself to be controlled and guided by the h Lt. Governor till a very late stage when Shri Lal
Narain Sinha, learned counsel for the Union of India took a definite stand and submitted that the Lt.
Governor had no voice in the matter.

The material available in this case is sufficient to hold that the impugned notices suffer from
arbitrariness and non-application of mind. They are violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Hence
they are liable to be quashed. It is not necessary therefore to express any opinion on the contentions
based on Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.

The rest of the questions relate truly to the civil rights of the parties flowing from the lease deed.
Those questions cannot be effectively disposed of in this petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution. The questions arising out of the lease, such as, whether there has been breach of the
covenants under the lease, whether the lease can be forfeited, whether relief against forfeiture can be
granted etc. are foreign to the scope of Article 32 of the Constitution. They cannot be decided just on
affidavits. These are matters which should be tried in a regular A civil proceeding. One should
remember that the property belongs to the Union of India and the rights in it cannot be bartered
away in accordance with the sweet will of an Officer or a Minister or a Lt. Governor but they should
be dealt with in accordance with law. At the same time a person who has acquired rights in such
property cannot also be deprived of them except in accordance with law. The stakes in this case are
very high for both the parties and neither of them can take law into his own hands.

I, therefore, quash the impugned notices and direct the respondents not to take any further action
against the petitioners pursuant to them. I express no opinion on the rights of the parties under the
lease and all other questions argued in this case. They are left open to be decided in an appropriate
proceeding. It is, however, open to both the parties if they are so advised to take such fresh action as
may be open to them in law on the basis of all the relevant facts including those which existed before
the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 was issued by the Engineer Officer of the Land and
Development Office to vindicate their respective rights in accordance with law. This order is made
without prejudice to the right of the Union Government to compound the breaches, if any,
committed by the lessee and the regularise the lease by receiving adequate premium there- fore
from the lessee, if it is permissible to do so.

It is open to the Delhi Municipal Corporation to examine the matter afresh independently and to
take such action that may be open to it in accordance with law. The Delhi Municipal Corporation
may, if so advised, instead of taking any further action against the petitioners permit the petitioners
to compound the breaches, if any, committed by them in accordance with law.

I allow the petitions accordingly. The costs of the petitioner No. 1 shall be paid by the Union
Government and the Lt. Governor of Delhi. There shall be no order as to costs against the other

respondents. The other petitioners shall bear their costs.

MISRA, J. [have perused the judgment prepared by brother Justice A.P. Sen as also the judgment of
brother Justice E.S. Venkataramiah. While I agree that the impugned notices threatening re-entry
and demolition of the construction are invalid and have no legal value and must be quashed for
reasons detailed in the two judgments, which I do not propose to repeat over again, I am of the view
that the other questions involved in the case are based upon contractual obligations between the
parties. These questions can be satisfactorily and effectively dealt with in a property instituted
proceeding or suit and not by a writ petition on the basis of affidavits which are 80 discrepant and
contradictory in this case.

The right to the land and to construct buildings thereon for running a business is not derived from
Article 19(1)(a) or 19(1)(g) of the Constitution but springs from terms of contract between the parties
regulated by other laws governing the subject, viz., the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the Master
Plan, the Zonal Development Plan framed under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and the Delhi
Municipal Bye-laws, 1959 irrespective of the purpose for which the buildings are constructed.
Whether there has been a breach of the contract of lease or whether there has been a breach of the
other statutes regulating the construction of buildings are the questions which can be properly
decided by taking detailed evidence involving examination and cross- examination of Witnesses.

I accordingly allow that writ petitions with costs against the Union Government and the Lt.
Governor of Delhi and quash the impugned notices.

REVIEW PETITION NO.. 670 OF 1985 ORDER We have gone through the application for review
and the connected papers. The application is supported by an affidavit by the petitioner Jagmohan,
former Lieutenant- Governor of Delhi who was respondent no.2 in Writ Petitions Nos. 535-539 of
1980, decided on October 7, 1985. He seeks review of the judgment delivered by this Court
principally on the ground that there is an error apparent on the face of the record as the judgment
turns on certain arguments and statements attributed to Shri L.N. Sinha, learned counsel appearing
for respondent no.1, the Union of India and to Shri M.C. Bhandare , learned counsel appearing for
respondent no.3 , Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The petitioner Jagmohan avers in the affidavit
that the contents of Paras 1 to 3 are true to his knowledge and based on information derived from
the counsel appearing in the case which he believes to be true. Along with the application for review
he has annexed a letter dated October 12, 1985 addressed by Shri P.P.Singh who was assisting Shri
L.N.Sinha asserting that the learned counsel had never advanced the arguments attributed to him
the judgment and a letter of Shri M.C. Bhandare, dated October 13, 1985 addressed to Shri B.P.
Maheshwari, Advocate-on-Record of respondent no.3 , Municipal Corporation of Delhi denying that
he ever made the statement attributed to him at pp. 189-190 of the judgment delivered by one of us
(Sen, J). In the first letter, Shri P.P. Singh writes to say :

"There are certain statements in the judgment which are attributed to Shri Sinha
having made in the course of his arguments which do not seem to be correct as
having been made by him. I have discussed the matter with Mr. Sinha and he agrees
with me that it is not correct that he made the following statements during his course
of arguments :

(a) "He has further submitted that the land leased under the lease deed being nazul
land is exclusively owned by the Union Government and the powers delegated to the
former Chief Commission of Delhi under the lease deed were no longer exercisably by
the present Lt. Governor of Delhi."

(b) "Lo. On the date on which the action was initiated in this case by the Lt.
Governor against the petitioner the Lt. Governor had acted without authority or
power.

(c) That "the Learned Counsel for the Union of India had disowned all the actions of
the Lt. Governor."

(d) That the Learned Counsel for Respondent NO.1 i.e. the Union of India "contended
that Lt. Governor, as an Administrator had no function as the Lessor or its delegatee"

(e) That "the Lt. Governor could not usurp the powers and functions of the Union of
India in relation to the property of the Union and therefore had no functions in
relation to the lease in question"

(f) That "the Central Government were contemplating to undertake a legislation and
to provide for a Forum for adjudication of such disputes (Shri Sinha did inform the
Court that he had advised the Central Government to undertake a legislation for
empowering the Government to condone the violations of the nature involved in the
present case in public interest)"

seseeee It is incorrect as stated at pages 90-91 of the judgment that the Learned Counsel
for the Union of India conceded that the Impugned Notice was invalid and had no
legal effect."

In the second letter Shri M.C. Bhandare writes to Shri B.P. Maheshwari, and states :

"Your clients, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, have acquired from you as to how
His Lordship Mr. Justice A.P. Sen, in his judgment has made the following
observations :

"Shri M.C. Bhandare, learned counsel appearing for respondent nos. 3 & 4, municipal
Corporation of Delhi and Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal
Corporation, Delhi is fair enough to state that if the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.,
were to make an application for modification of the sanctioned plan pertaining to the
new building with respect to the basement and the working platform which according
to the Municipal Corporation constitute double basements and the inter-connecting
underground passage connecting the existing Indian Express Building, the same shall
be considered having regard to consideration of justice and the needs of the
petitioners and also taking into consideration that the new building has been

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

constructed for installing a printing press and that the press so installed cannot
function without the working platform which the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd., have
already constructed, as well as the fact that the underground passage has been
constructed by them for inter-connecting the new building with the existing Indian
Express Building. He further states that the Municipal Corporation will compound
the deviation which is minimum on payment of such composition fee as is payable
under the bye-laws.

Learned counsel states that this shall not be treated as a precedent for others."
(pages 189-190 of the Judgment)"
After settling out what he mentions were his submissions, he says:

seseeee I never made the statement attributed to me. However, I did say that any cause
shown by the petitioners would be considered in accordance with law. I may
categorically state that there was no statement on my part that the deviation were
minimum or that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi would compound the deviations
on payment of such composition fee as was payable under the bye-laws. This assumes
that the composition is permissible under the bye-laws, which was a disputed matter.
I did not state that this should not be treated as a precedent for others. I never made
an argument whereby I contended that there would be a discriminatory treatment
either in favour or against the Indian Express.

He thus categorically asserts that there was no statement on his part that the deviations were
minimal or that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi would compound the deviation on payment of
such composition fee as payable under the Bye- laws. Further, he denies that he ever stated that
composition of the deviations, according to his statement, by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi
should not be treated as a precedent for others.

It is unfortunate that the two senior counsel have chosen this devious and, indeed, curious method
of disowning arguments advanced by them. The proper thing for them to do would have been to file
affidavits and either file petitions for review or have the matters listed, with the permission of the
Court, for being mentioned. Instead, the modus operandi adopted was to address letters to the
Advocates-on- Record who in turn have, for reasons best known to them, passed on the letters to the
petitioner Jag Mohan who was not their client at all. Advance copies of this petition laying emphasis
on the aforesaid two letters of counsel appearing for other parties which, we do not doubt have the
effect of scandalizing the Court, appear to have been given to the press for publication. We deprecate
the conduct of those involved in this unsavory event. We feel greatly concerned that the advocates of
this Court who are not mere pleaders for parties but officers of the Court should stoop to such
blameworthy tactics, unworthy of the high traditions of the noble and learned profession to which
they belong. We feel grieved and not a little perturbed at all this.

Every word written in the judgement formulating the arguments advanced by Shri L.N. Sinha,
learned counsel for respondent no. 1, Union of India 18 taken from our minute-books in which we
noted the arguments of counsel almost verbatim during the course of hearing particularly because
the matter involved questions of grave public importance. It is therefore highly improper for Shri
P.P. Singh who was assisting Shri L.N. Sinha to suggest in his letter dated October 12, 1985 that the
argument attributed to learned counsel for respondent no. 1 in the judgment were never advanced
by him. We cannot possibly act on any correspondence that passed between the petitioner
Jagmohan and Shri P.P. Singh, Advocate-on-Record of respondent no. 1., Union of India or that
between Shri M.C. Bhandare, and Shri B.P. Maheshwari, Advocate-on-Record for respondent no. 3,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

As regards the allegation made by Shri M.C. Bhandare in his letter dated October 13, 1985 addressed
to Shri B.E. Maheshwari it is enough to mention that we recorded three statements made by counsel
during the course of hearing. We distinctly remember that on September 14, 1983 during the course
of hearing we required learned counsel appearing for the parties to clarify the legal position. Two of
the statements were recorded on September 14 1983, one by Dr. L.M. Singhvi appearing for
respondent No. 2, Lt. Governor of Delhi and respondent No. 5, Land & Development Officer as to
the amount of conversion charges payable, and the other by Shri Arun Jaitley appearing for the
petitioners regarding the willingness of the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to pay the conversion
charges. The third statement by Shri M.C. Bhandare learned counsel for respondent No. 3,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi was recorded on September 15, 1983 signifying the willingness of
the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to compound the deviations as they were minimal on payment of
the usual composition fee. We have satisfied ourselves by perusing the Minutes of the Court
proceedings as recorded by the Court Master on September 14 and 15, 19&3 that the statements of
all the three counsel were recorded in the minutes. We have no doubt that the statements were
shown to all the counsel.

The typescript of the statements made by Shri M.C. Bhandare as recorded in the Minutes of the
Court proceedings by the Court Master on September 15, 1983 reads as follows :

"Shri Bhandare appearing for the Municipal Corporation is fair enough to say that the
petitioner would make an application for modification of the sanctioned plan with
respect to the basement and the working h platform and the inter-connecting
underground passage the same shall be considered having regard to the
consideration of justice and the needs and also taking into consideration that the
building has been constructed for installing a printing press and that the press cannot
function without the working platform which is already constructed. The learned
counsel states that this shall not be treated as precedent for others. The Municipal
Corporation will compound the deviation which is minimum on payment of whatever
composition fee."

The statement attributed to Shri M.C. Bhandare learned counsel for respondent No. 3 at pp.189-190
of the judgment is virtually a verbatim reproduction of t he correct draft prepared from the rough

draft of the statement actually made by him in Court subject to certain grammatical variations

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1902038/ 130Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 7 October, 1985

signifying the willingness of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to compound the deviations as they
were minimal on payment of the usual composition fee.

We are constrained to observed that the review application is lacking in bonafides, based on false
averments and constitutes a flagrant abuse of the process of the Court. The allegations contained in
the aforesaid two letters are wholly inaccurate and totally false. Such attempts to question the
sanctity of the Court proceedings unless ruthlessly curbed will have the tendentious effect of making
fearless dispensation of justice by the Courts in India almost impossible.

We had been extremely indulgent with the petitioner Jagmohan, who was respondent No. 2 in the
aforesaid Writ Petitions. In the joint counter filed by him on behalf of the respondents he made
several statements which were far from accurate but we refrained from taking any action. This crude
attempt on his part by filing this review application on totally false allegations is an attempt to
subvert the course of justice. His conduct in casting serious aspersions on the Court by suggesting in
paragraph 10 that the delay in the pronouncement of the judgment was responsible for 'facts stated
and submissions made on behalf of the respondent, having a decisive bearing on the case' escaping '
the attention of their Lordships' virtually amounts to gross contempt of Court. We cannot also help
in observing that there has in this case been lamentably complete lack of candour and want of
probity on the part of some of the counsel in making factually incorrect statements and thereby
casting aspersions on the Court.

The review application is accordingly dismissed. Nothing that we have said will affect the separate
judgements delivered by each one of US.

We direct the Registrar of this Court to keep the documents enumerated hereinafter in sealed covers
under his custody, namely:

1. The minute-book of the Court proceedings maintained by the Court Master, dated
September 14 and 15, 1983.

2. The original draft typescripts of the aforesaid statements prepared by the Court Master on
September 14 and 15, 1983.

3. The shorthand notebook of the Private Secretary to Sen, J. dated September 15, 1983 from which
the correct drafts of the statements actually made by the counsel on September 14 and 15, 1983 were
prepared.

4. The fair drafts prepared by the Private Secretary of the said statements on September 15, 1983.

The Registrar shall also keep the original records of Writ Petitions Nos. 535-539 of 1980 ina
separate sealed cover under his custody.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CIVIL APPEAL NO.4154 OF 2000

Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. and another ...Appellant(s)

Versus
Minguel Martins and others . ..Respondent(s)
WITH

Civil Appeal Nos.4155 and 4156 of 2000

JUDGMENT
SINGHVI, J.

1. The above noted appeals are directed against order dated 25.4.2000 passed by Goa Bench of the
High Court of Bombay in Writ Petition No.330 of 1991 Shri Minguel Martins vs. M/s Sociedade e
Fomento Industries Pvt. Ltd. and others, Writ Petition No.36 of 1992 Goa Foundation and another
vs. Fomento Hotels and Resorts Limited and others and Writ Petition No.141 of 1992 Shri Gustavo
Renato de Cruz Pinto vs. State of Goa and others whereby directions have been given for demolition
of construction made in survey No.803 (new No.246/2) within the area of Gram Panchayat,
Taleigao, for resumption of the land acquired on behalf of appellant No.1, Fomento Resorts and
Hotels Limited, earlier known as M/s. Gomantak Land Development Pvt. Ltd. and keeping public
access to the Vainguinim beach from point ‘A’ to point ‘B' shown in plan Exhibit-A open without
any obstruction of any kind.

2. For deciding the questions arising in the appeals, it will be useful to notice the relevant facts:
(i) Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto owned several parcels of land in Village Taleigao, District Tiswadi, Goa.
He sold plots bearing survey Nos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) to Gustavo Renato da

Cruz Pinto and plots bearing survey Nos.787 and 805 (new Nos.246/1 and 245/1) to M/s. Sociedade
e Fomento Industries Pvt. Ltd. (appellant No.2 herein).

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 1Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

(ii) After purchasing the land, appellant No.2 leased out the same to appellant No.1. The latter
submitted an application to Gram Panchayat Taleigao (for short ‘the Gram Panchayat’) for grant of
permission to construct hotel complex near Vainguinim beach. On a reference made by the Gram
Panchayat, Chief Town Planner, Government of Goa, Daman and Diu vide his letter dated 1.8.1978
informed that the plans submitted by appellant No.1 are in conformity with the regulations in force
in the area but observed that right of the public to access the beach must be maintained by providing
necessary footpath. Paragraph 2 of that letter reads as under:
"The road leading to the hotel complex is at present used by general public to
approach the Vainguinim Beach which is popular picnic spot for the people of Panaji,
as well as other parts of Goa. It will need to be ensured that the right of access to the
beach is maintained by the applicant by providing the necessary footpath to the
beach at an appropriate place. The parking facilities provided will also have to take
care of the parking of vehicles of such members of the public in an appropriate
manner. This will ensure that the beach remains open to public as it is at present and
that the public is not deprived of this beautiful and frequently used beach."

[emphasis added]

(iii) Thereafter, the Gram Panchayat issued letter dated 22.8.1978, whereby appellant
No.1 was permitted to lay access road linking Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road to the
construction site and construct the hotel subject to the conditions specified in the
letter including the one relating to public access to the beach. This was reiterated by
the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat in his letter dated 1.12.1978.

(iv) In furtherance of the permission granted by the Gram Panchayat, appellant No.1 commenced
construction of the hotel, which is now known as Hotel Cidade de Goa on the land forming part of
survey No.787 (new No.246/1) and completed the same by May, 1983 in different stages, the details
of which are given below:
"Period Physical Progress Expenditure Ex

1983 water supply and sanitation

and electrical works and
civil works and interiors
of fourth cluster of rooms.

(v) During construction of the hotel building, appellant No.1 made an

application dated 29.9.1979 to the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat, for permission to change the
location of the footpath and parking area by stating that in view of installation of 10,000 Kg. gas
tank (poisonous gas at high pressure), pressurized water tank and high voltage electric transformer
near the hotel building, it will not be in public interest to locate the footpath and parking area at the
sanctioned site.

(vi) The Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat neither forwarded the application of appellant No.1 to the
Town and Planning Department for eliciting its views nor placed the same before the Gram
Panchayat. Instead he, on his own, wrote letter dated 29.9.1979 to appellant No.1 giving an
impression that the Gram Panchayat does not have any objection to the change of location of the
footpath and parking area. Thereafter, appellant No.1 is said to have shifted access to the beach from
the location originally sanctioned. However, the maps produced before this Court during the course
of hearing show that the footpath is still near the gas tank.

(vii) In the meanwhile, Shri Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto, Smt. Surana Pepfira Pinto and Miss
Befta Sara Da Costa Pinto filed Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior
Division, at Panaji against appellant No.2, Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto and four others for a decree of
possession by pre-emption in respect of the land comprised in survey Nos.787 and 805 and also to
restrain the defendants, their agents, servants, etc. from changing, alienating or raising any
construction on the suit land by alleging that they were owners of property bearing survey Nos.803,
804, 806, 807, 788 and 789 situated at Taleigao and since time immemorial they and their
predecessors were using footpath passing through survey Nos.787, 805 and 769 for going to
Panaji-Dona Paola-Bambolim road, which was sought to be obstructed. Defendant No.1 in the suit
(appellant No.2 herein) filed written statement to contest the suit. After some time, the parties

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 3Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

compromised the matter in terms of which the plaintiffs gave up their claim for pre- emption in
respect of plot bearing survey Nos.787 and 805 and defendant No.1 agreed to exchange the plot
bearing survey No.790 with plots bearing survey Nos.788 and 789 belonging to the plaintiffs and
also that it will have no right of access through any of the properties of the plaintiffs. As a sequel to
this, the plaintiffs applied for withdrawal of the suit. By an order dated 20.12.1978, the Civil Judge
permitted them to do so.

(viii) Soon after withdrawal of the suit for pre-emption, appellant No.1 made an application dated
15.11.1978 to Shri Shankar Laad, Minister of Revenue, Government of Goa for acquisition of land
comprised in survey Nos.788, 789, 803, 804, 806 and 807 (new Nos.246/3, 246/4, 246/2, 245/2,
etc.) of Village Taleigao, Dona Paula for construction of Beach Resort Hotel Complex by highlighting
its benefit to the State. Paragraphs 3 to 6 of the application, which have bearing on the decision of
these appeals, read as under:

"3. It is proposed to put up a hotel complex in the two phases, in the first phase it is
proposed that a hotel building is put up in Plot No. 787 in the second phase it is
proposed that a Yoga Centre, Health Club and Water Sports facilities for promoting
tourism are put in Plot No. 805. Our Hotel Project which is estimated to cost Rs.150
lakhs and will have 100 rooms in its first phase will add to meeting the much needed
demand for accommodation by the international tourists.

4. In the first phase of the hotel complex it is necessary to develop plot No.787 and to immediately
proceed to construct the Hotel Building thereon. The land in plot No.787 consists of hilly and rocky
area and the land abutting on the beach is also of different levels. In order to put up a hotel building
in this plot it would be necessary to undertake cutting of rock which would disturb the topography of
the area entailing considerable expense. It is, therefore, necessary that the lay-out for the hotel
building is finalized in a manner that the rock cutting is minimized and, at the same time, the
natural surroundings of the rock and foliage is maintained. Exclusive cutting of rock is also likely to
result in land-slides and may pose danger to the foundation of the hotel buildings and its residents.
It is, therefore, necessary to construct the hotel building as near the beach as possible, i.e. on the
lowest level of the land abutting the beach.

5. There are two small plots bearing No.788 and 789 area abutting the beach. Those two small plots
fall almost midway along the beach frontage of our said plot No.787 and project into the said plot.
Those two small plots are in the lowest level of the land and as such are most suited for including in
the lay-out plan of the hotel. These two small plots being closest to the beach it is essential for us to
install a first aid post and a medical aid centre for providing safety measures to the people using the
beach facilities. Besides it is a precondition for a beach resort hotel giving comforts to provide those
facilities both for the residents and for public at large. Keeping in view those factors it is necessary
that these two small plots of land are immediately acquired and included in the lay-out plan of the
hotel. It is also necessary that the acquisition of these two small plots of land is urgently completed
and possession handed over to enable the lay out plan of the hotel building to be readjusted at this
initial stage itself, on the ground prepared by proper leveling and terracing before the actual
construction work could begin. It is, therefore, necessary that the two plots of land be urgently

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 4Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

acquired in the first instance so that there is no delay whatsoever in implementing the first phase of
the hotel project.

6. In order to take in hand the second phase of the hotel complex it would be desirable to acquire
plot Nos. 803 and 804 which intervene between our second Plot No. 805 and our first plot No. 787
and plot Nos. 806 and 807 which adjoin our second plot No. 805. This would enable us to undertake
the second phase of the project as described above. The entire complex will then become one
composite unit and these facilities could then be easily availed of by the hotel residents and the
resident of this territory. The facilities provided by the hotel will be open for use on membership to
non-residents also. Such facilities are not readily and easily available to the people of this."

(ix) Acting on the application made by the developer, the Government of Goa issued notification
No.HD/LQN/315/78 dated 29.10.1980 under Section 4(1) of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short
‘the 1894 Act') for acquisition of the plots comprised in survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and survey
No.804 (new No.245/2).

(x) After holding enquiry under Section 5A of the 1894 Act, the State Government issued declaration
under Section 6, which was published in Gazette dated 27.10.1983.

(xi) Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and some others filed Writ Petition No.8/1984 for quashing the
aforementioned notifications on various grounds including the one that before acquiring the land,
government did not make enquiry as per the requirement of Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition
(Companies) Rules, 1963 (for short ‘the Rules’). The writ petitioners also highlighted discrepancies
in different notifications issued by the State Government. Respondent No.2 in the writ petition
(appellant No.1 herein) filed reply affidavit stating therein that Rule 4 of the Rules is not mandatory
and non compliance thereof did not affect legality of the acquisition. In paragraphs 67 and 76 of the
reply affidavit, it was averred that part of the project i.e. hotel is complete and has started
functioning. In paragraph 79, it was averred that besides the hotel project, cottages were proposed
to be constructed on plot bearing survey No.805 and the acquired land in survey Nos.803 and 804
will be used for putting up health club, yoga centre, water sports and other recreational facilities,
which are integral part of the project.

(xii) By an order dated 26.6.1984, Goa Bench of the High Court of Bombay allowed the writ petition
and quashed the impugned notifications only on the ground of non compliance of Rule 4 of the
Rules. That order was reversed by this Court in M/s. Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. vs. Gustavo
Renato Da Cruz Pino and Others [(1985) 2 SCC 152] and the case was remitted to the High Court for
deciding other grounds of challenge. It, however, appears that after the judgment of this Court, the
parties compromised the matter and the writ petition was withdrawn on 26.3.1985.

(xiii) In the meanwhile, appellant No.1 entered into an agreement with the government as per the

requirement of Section 41 of the 1894 Act. The agreement was signed on 26.10.1983. The opening
three paragraphs and Clauses 3, 4 and 6 of the agreement read as under:

Company for the acquisition of the said land or its value as undeveloped land at the time of
resumption, whichever is less, but excluding the cost or value of any improvements made by the
Company to the said land or any structure standing on the said land, shall be paid as compensation
to the Company.

Provided that the said land and the amenities, if any, created thereon shall not be so resumed unless
due notice of the breach complained of has been given to the Company and the Company has failed
to make good the breach or to comply with any directions issued by the Government in this behalf,
within the time specified in the said notice for compliance therewith."

[Emphasis added]

(xiv) Although, the agreement was signed on 26.10.1983, possession of the acquired land was given
to appellant No.1 only after withdrawal of Writ Petition No.8 of 1984 for which permission was
granted on 26.3.1985.

(xv) After delivery of possession of the acquired land, Smt. Anju Timblo, Director of appellant No.1,
made an application to Panjim Planning and Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as ‘the
Development Authority') under Sections 44(1) read with Section 49(1) of the Goa, Daman & Diu
Town and Country Planning Act, 1974 (hereinafter described as ‘Town & Country Planning Act') for
grant of permission for extension of the existing hotel building on survey Nos.246/1, 246/3 and
246/4 (old survey Nos.787, 788 and 789). The applicant did not seek extension of hotel building to
survey No.246/2 apparently because of the express embargo contained in Clause 4(viii) of the
agreement that the company shall never construct any building or structure in the acquired land.

(xvi) The aforementioned application was considered by the EEC in its 23rd meeting held on
11.6.1987 and was favourably recommended subject to the condition that pedestrian path along the
beach may be made available by constructing an access from the jetty so that public can reach the
beach during the high tide period. Thereafter, the matter was considered in the meeting of the EDC
held on 11.9.1987 and it was decided to accept the recommendations of the EEC, subject to the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 7Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

condition regarding pedestrian path. The decision of the EDC was communicated to Smt. Anju
Timblo by the Chief Town Planner vide his letter dated 14.10.1987, the relevant portion of which
read as under:

"In continuation of this office letter No. DE/4757(DZ/2009)3055/87 dated 10.7.87, it is to inform
that the project was discussed in the 10th meeting of the Eco Development Council held on 11.9.87
and the Council has cleared the project as per the plans submitted by you with condition that
pedestrian path be made available by construction an access from the jetty so that the public can
reach the beach even during high tide."

(xvii) In furtherance of the decision taken by the EDC, the Development Authority issued an order
under Section 44(3)(c) read with Section 49(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act whereby
permission was granted to appellant No.1 for extension of the existing hotel building. The opening
paragraph and Clause 10 of the conditions incorporated in that order, read as under:

"Whereas an application has been made by Shri/Smt. Anju Timblo, Development permission is
issued for extension to the existing Hotel Building with respect to his/her land zoned as commercial
zone bearing Survey No. 246 approved Sub No. 1, 3 and 4 Chalta No. - P.T. Sheet No.__ of
Taleigao Village Town in accordance with the provisions of Section 44(1)/49(1) of the Goa, Daman
and Diu Town and Country Planning Act, 1974, read with Rule 13 of the Planning & Development
Rules 1977 framed thereunder. And whereas, a development charge affixed at Rs.84,170/- has been
paid by him/her.

Therefore, under the powers vested in this Authority under Section 44(3)) / 49(2) of the Goa,
Daman & Diu Town & Country Planning Act, 1974, the above said applicant is granted development
permission to carry out development in accordance with the enclosed plans subject to the following
conditions:-"........

10) The Pedestrian path has to be made available by constructing an access from the jetty so that the
public can reach the beach even during high tide." (xviii) After some time another application was
made on behalf of appellant No.1 under Section 46 read with Section 44 of the Town and Country
Planning Act for renewal of the permission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988 with a deviation in
respect of plots bearing survey Nos.246/1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, for the first time, a request was made for
raising construction in survey No. 803 (new No.246/2) in the garb of making deviation from the
permission already granted. This application was not put up either before the EEC or EDC and was
straightaway considered by the Goa Town and Country Planning Board (for short ‘the Board’) in its
meeting held on 20.6.1991 as an additional item and the following decision was taken:- "The
proposal relating to extension/deviation of Hotel Cidade de Goa which also involves relaxation in
number of floors was considered and approved subject to the condition that the height shall not
exceed the stipulated limit of 17.5 mts. which was applicable at the time when the project was
approved".

(xix) The above reproduced decision of the Board was forwarded by the State Government to the
Development Authority. However, without even waiting for consideration by the competent body,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 8Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

appellant No.1 appears to have started construction by deviating from the approved plan. This
compelled the Chairman of the Development Authority to send letter dated 12.7.1991 to appellant
No.1 requiring it to refrain from going ahead with further construction.

(xx) It is not borne out from the record that matter relating to extension of the hotel building on plot
bearing survey No.803 (new No.246/2) was ever placed before the EDC, but the Development
Authority suo moto passed order dated 20.4.1992 vide which permission was granted to appellant
No.1 to carry out the development on plot bearing survey No.246/1, 2, 3 and 4 subject to the terms
and conditions specified therein, including the following:

"The condition No.10 of the Order No.PDA/T/7471/297/88 dated 15.4.1988 should be strictly
adhered to."

(xxi) When appellant No.1 started extension of the hotel building in violation of the permission
accorded by the EDC, Shri Minguel Martins, who claims to have purchased plots carved out of
survey No.792 (new No.242/1), popularly known as ‘“Machado's Cove’, filed Writ Petition
No.330/1991, for issue of a direction to the State Government, Village Panchayat Taleigao and other
official respondents to remove the illegal construction made by appellant No.1, to refrain from
granting any permission for construction or regularizing the construction already made by appellant
No.1 and also revoke the permission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988. He further prayed for issue
of a direction to respondent Nos.1 and 2 in the writ petition (appellants herein) to keep the
traditional access to the beach open and not to put up any further construction on plots bearing
survey Nos.787 and 803, which would interfere with the public road, parking lot and public access
to the beach. In paragraph 3 of his petition, Shri Minguel Martins made a mention of the alleged
violation of the conditions contained in letters dated 1.8.1978 and 22.8.1978 issued by the Chief
Town Planner and Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat respectively by asserting that respondent Nos.1
and 2 (appellants herein) have closed the road and footpath to the beach and commenced
construction of the parking, which he has been challenged in Writ Petition No.284/1991. In
paragraphs 5 to 7, he referred to agreement dated 26.10.1983, and alleged that in complete violation
of the mandate thereof, respondent Nos.1 and 2 have made construction in survey No.803 and
blocked public access to the beach. He also pleaded that even though the land was acquired for
sports and recreational facilities and use thereof for any other purpose is prohibited by the terms of
agreement, the official respondents are trying to regularize illegal structures put up by respondent
Nos.1 and 2 and even violation of CRZ is being ignored. Another plea taken by Shri Minguel Martins
was that respondent Nos.1 and 2 have constructed sewerage treatment plant and laundry without
obtaining permission from the competent authority under the Water (Prevention and Control of
Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

(xxii) In the reply affidavit filed on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2 in Writ Petition No.330/1991
(appellants herein), it was pleaded that the petitioner is liable to be non- suited on the ground of
laches and also on the ground that disputed questions of fact are involved. It was further pleaded
that the writ petition has been instituted with an oblique motive at the instance of Dr. Alvaro de
Souze Macahdo, one of the co-owners of survey No.792 and developer of Machado's Cove, namely,
M/s. Alcon Real Estate Private Ltd., who filed Civil Suit No.67 of 1986 for similar relief but could not

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 9Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

persuade Civil Judge, Junior Division, Panaji to entertain their prayer for temporary injunction. The
appellants alleged that after having failed to secure injunction from the civil court, Victor
Albuquerque, the partner of M/s. Alcon Real Estates Private Ltd. filed Writ Petition No.284/1991
and Minguel Martins filed Writ Petition No.330/1991 and this was indicative of the fact that the
petitioner was in collusion with the developer of Machado's Cove. They also questioned, the locus of
the petitioner by stating that plot bearing survey No.792 has not been sub-divided and he does not
have any interest in that property. On merits it was averred that road, car parking facilities and
footpath leading to the beach have been provided in accordance with the condition imposed by the
Chief Town Planner and Gram Panchayat and the same are in existence since 1979 and are being
used by the public without any obstruction. The appellants denied existence of a pathway through
survey Nos.792 and 803 and pleaded that members of the public do not have the right to access the
beach through survey No.803. The appellants also relied on Section 16 of the 1894 Act and averred
that even if there existed access to the beach through the acquired land, the same stood extinguished
after vesting of the land in the government, possession of which was given to appellant No.1 on
26.3.1985. On the issue of extension of hotel building, the appellants pleaded that additional
construction was made in accordance with the permission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988 and
after obtaining approval of the proposed deviation from the competent authority. As regards, the
laundry and water treatment plant, it was averred that temporary sheds were constructed for
laundry after obtaining permission from the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat and that treated
effluent are intended to be used for gardening, manuring and other purposes for which no separate
permission was necessary. The appellants referred to Suit No.313/1978/A filed by Gustavo Renato
da Cruz Pinto and others for decree of possession by pre-emption and averred that the so called
admissions made in the written statement about the existence of public pathway through plots
bearing survey Nos.792 and 803 is not binding on them because contents of the written statement
were not verified by the authorized representative of appellant No.2, on the basis of personal
knowledge and in their rejoinder, even the plaintiffs had not accepted the existence of such pathway.
In support of their plea that there is no public pathway or access to the beach through survey Nos.
792 and 803, the appellants relied on the judgment of Special Civil Suit No. 67/1986 - Alvaro De
Souza Machado and another vs. Sociedade De Fomento Industrial Pvt. Ltd. and another.

(xxiii) The Goa Foundation, which is the registered society and is engaged in the protection of
ecology and environment in the State of Goa and Dr. Claudo Alvares, Secretary of the Goa
Foundation filed Writ Petition No.36/1992 with prayers similar to those made in Writ Petition No.
330/1991. They also invoked Article 51(g) of the Constitution of India and pleaded that the
Vainguinim beach, which is a public asset, is sought to be privatized by the respondents (appellants
herein) and they have advertised the hotel in foreign country as having a private beach. In
paragraph 9 of Writ Petition No.36/1992, the petitioners claimed that the villagers of Taleigao and
general public have been using access to the beach that run through plots bearing survey Nos.792
and 803 (new Nos.242/1 and 246/2) in addition to the path running along the boundary of survey
No.787 (new No.246/1). They relied on the admissions contained in the written statement filed on
behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A to show that public access to the beach
exists through survey No.803 and pleaded that in complete disregard of agreement dated
26.10.1983, the appellants have constructed hotel building without obtaining permission from the
competent authority and they have unauthorisedly put up wall encircling those plots and thereby

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 10Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

privatized Vainguinim beach.

(xxiv) Shri Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto, who had earlier filed Special Civil Suit No.313/78/A for
pre-emption, also joined the fray by filing Writ Petition No.141/1992. He claimed that public access
to the beach through plot bearing survey No.803 has been blocked in utter violation of the
conditions specified in agreement dated 26.10.1983. Another plea taken by Gustavo Renato da Cruz
Pinto was that the land was acquired under Section 40(1)(b) of the 1894 Act and, therefore, the
respondents in the writ petition are duty bound to provide amenities to the public in terms of
agreement dated 26.10.1983, which they have failed to do.

(xxv) The reply affidavits filed in Writ Petition Nos.36/1992 and 141/1992 were substantially similar
to the counter filed in Writ Petition No.330/1991 except that in the reply affidavit of Writ Petition
No.36/1992, the appellants denied that they were trying to privatize Vainguinim beach. They
claimed that the disputed construction is located at a distance of 200 meters from high tide line and
about 1000 meters from Dona Paula jetty. According to the appellants, the beach in question is not a
type of coastal beach but has exclusiveness and in that sense it was advertised as a private beach.
While defending Writ Petition No.141/1992, Smt. Anju Timblo claimed that there has been no
violation of agreement dated 26.10.1983 and the construction has been made after obtaining
permission from the competent authority. She also enclosed permission granted by the Sarpanch of
the Gram Panchayat for putting up temporary shed for washing machines.

(xxvi) A separate reply affidavit was filed by Shri Moraed Ahmed, Member Secretary of
Development Authority in Writ Petition No.330/1991. The substance of his affidavit was that the
Development Authority has neither granted approval to the deviation nor renewed the development
permission of appellant No.1. He also referred to the illegal construction found at the time of
inspections conducted on 15.5.1990 and 14.5.1991 which blocked public access to the river or
reduced its width and averred that on being asked to do so, appellant No.1 demolished the
obstruction/illegal construction.

3. At the hearing of the writ petitions, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners did not
press the grounds of challenge involving violation of CRZ Regulation and construction of sewerage
treatment plant without obtaining permission/consent from the competent authority. After taking
note of their statement, the High Court considered other issues raised before it and held that the
land was acquired under Section 40(1)(b); that the extension of the hotel building on an area
measuring 1000 square meters of survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and other constructions were
legally impermissible. The High Court negatived the argument of the appellants' counsel that in view
of Section 16 of the 1894 Act encumbrance, if any, stood wiped out by observing that traditional
public right of way cannot be strictly treated as an encumbrance and existence of the way which was
in use from time immemorial by the public openly, peacefully and continuously can not be affected,
more so, because in the agreement itself, access through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) is
acknowledged in the form of Clause 4(ix). The High Court also rejected the explanations given by
the appellants for advertising the beach as a private beach and held that they cannot obstruct the
passage by putting up wall/barbed wire fencing. In the end, the High Court observed that after
executing agreement dated 26.10.1983, the State Government totally abandoned its duty and did not

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 1Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

bother to ensure compliance of the condition incorporated in it.

4. On the aforesaid premise, the High Court allowed the writ petitions and gave the following
directions:
a. The constructions which have come up in survey No.246/2 (old 803) are required
to be demolished and the concerned authorities shall take action in this respect,
within a period of eight weeks from today and the compliance report within two
weeks therefrom. b. A notice for resumption of the land as required under proviso to
clause 6 of the agreement dated 26.10.1983 shall be issued within ten weeks by the
Government to the hotel to show cause as to why, in the circumstances, the acquired
land should not be resumed. The Government shall then take appropriate decision in
accordance with law.

c. The access which is shown in plan Exh.A colly which is at page 33 of Writ Petition
No.141 of 1992 shall be kept open without any obstruction of any kind from point A-B
in order to come from Machado Cove side from point A to 803 (246/2 new) and then
to go to the beach beyond point B. We have already pointed out that this plan is to the
scale.

d. The challenge relating to yellow access and shifting the same to purple access
which is raised in Writ Petition No.330/91 has been exhaustively dealt with in
separate judgment in connected Writ Petitions No.284/91 and 37/92 and the order
passed therein shall govern the said challenge.

5. Before proceeding further, we consider it necessary to mention that during the pendency of these
appeals, the appellants filed I.As. for permission to file additional documents including copy of the
agreement entered into between plot owners/developers of Machado's Cove (old survey No.792)
with plot purchasers showing the pathway to be maintained in terms of order dated 9.4.1992 passed
in W.P. No.141/1992, photographs showing the pathway and extension of the hotel building on
survey No.803 (new No.246/2) which is partly occupied by health club, gymnasium, beauty parlour,
barber shop, steam, sauna, video games arcade and aerobics and part of circulation hall, kitchen
etc., photograph showing development of garden in survey No.803, a sketch showing the location of
path as per Exhibit A, copies of correspondence between the developer and appellant No.1 on the
one hand and functionaries of the State Government and Gram Panchayat on the other hand, orders
of the Development Authority, letter dated 12.7.1991 of the Chairman of the Development Authority,
pleadings of and/or evidence produced by the parties in Special Civil Suit Nos.313/1978/A and
67/1986 and the judgment of Special Civil Suit No.67/1986.

6. It is also apposite to mention that while issuing notice in Writ Petition No.141/1992, the High
Court passed an interim order directing appellant No.1 to maintain the public access from point ~A'
to “B' in survey No.803 (new No.246/2). In the special leave petitions, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the
directions contained in High Court's order and action initiated for resumption of the land were
stayed, but at the same time, the Court recorded that learned counsel for the petitioner has agreed

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 12Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

that pathway from point *A' to *B' in survey No.246/2 as shown at page 49 of Volume II of the
paper book in SLP (C) No.9875/2000 shall be maintained till further orders, [This page is a plan
showing the status of various plots including survey No.803 (new No.246/2) through which the
public path passes from point *A' to *B'].

7. Shri Anil B. Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, argued that land in survey
Nos.803 and 804 was acquired under Section 40(1)(aa) and not under Section 40(1)(b) of the 1894
Act and the High Court committed serious error in recording a finding that the acquisition was
under Section 40(1)(b). Learned senior counsel submitted that the expression "public purpose"
appearing in clause (aa) of Section 40(1) is relatable to the purpose of company and not as the term
is generally understood in the context of the provisions contained in Part II of the 1894 Act. Shri
Divan further submitted that in the absence of a specific stipulation to that effect in the notification
published under Section 4(1) of the 1894 Act and agreement dated 26.10.1983, the High Court was
not justified in issuing a mandamus for providing access to the beach through that survey number.
An alternative argument of Shri Divan is that the so called public access to the beach through survey
No.803 was running parallel to the nallah dividing survey No.803 on the one hand and survey
Nos.804 and 805 on the other hand and no useful purpose will be served by insisting on
maintaining that access because new path has been made available for access to the beach by
constructing road, car parking, etc. in compliance of the condition imposed by the Chief Town
Planner in his letter dated 1.8.1978 and by the Gram Panchayat while granting permission for
construction of hotel in survey No.787. Learned senior counsel referred to the affidavit filed on
behalf of the State Government before this Court and argued that when parties to the agreement
have clearly understood the terms thereof and the EDC gave permission for construction of sports
facilities and amenities without insisting that the same should be allowed to be used by members of
the public, except on paying the specified fees, the High Court committed an error by issuing a
mandamus for resumption of the land on the ground of the alleged violation of agreement dated
26.10.1983. Learned senior counsel extensively referred to the pleadings of three writ petitions and
additional documents filed in these appeals to show that hotel building was extended on plot
bearing survey No.803, after obtaining permission from the EDC and Development Authority and
submitted that the irregularity, if any, committed in that regard will be deemed to have been
regularized by order dated 20.4.1992 passed by the Development Authority. Shri Divan relied on
Clause 6 of the agreement and argued that even if the appellants can be said to have violated any of
the conditions of agreement, it is for the Government to take action for resumption of the land, after
giving opportunity to them to rectify the defect, etc. and the High Court could not have usurp the
power of the Government and directed demolition of the disputed construction. Learned senior
counsel also referred to judgment dated 13.3.2006 passed in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986 and
argued that in the face of unequivocal finding recorded by the competent court that there is no
pathway from survey No.792 (Machado's Cove) to survey No.803, the direction given by the High
Court for resumption of the land on the ground that access to the beach available to the public
through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) has been blocked in violation of the terms of agreement
dated 26.10.1983, is liable to be set aside. He further argued that the so-called admissions made in
the written statement filed in Special Civil Suit No.313/78/A cannot be read against the appellants
because the written statement was not signed by authorized representative of appellant No.2 on
personal knowledge and, in any case, the finding recorded by the competent court in Special Civil

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 13Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

Suit No.67/1986 should be treated as conclusive on the issue of non-existence of passage through
survey No.803. In support of this argument, learned senior counsel relied on the judgment of this
Court in Nagubai Ammal & ors. Vs. B. Shama Rao & ors. [(1956) SCR 451] and of Allahabad High
Court in Anurag Misra vs. Ravindra Singh and another [AIR 1994 Allahabad 124].

8. Shri Pallav Shihsodia, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Goa and other
official respondent, adopted the arguments of Shri Anil Divan and submitted that right of the public
to use the traditional passage through private land bearing survey No.803 (new No.246/2) could, at
the best, be treated as easementary right which stood extinguished with the acquisition of land
under Section 4(1) of the 1894 Act, and vesting thereof in the State Government in terms of Section
16. Shri Shishodia referred to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State in these appeals and
submitted that once possession of the acquired land was taken by the Government free from all
encumbrances, the writ petitioners could not have asked for an access to the beach through survey
No.803 for members of the public. He submitted that if public is allowed to use survey No.803,
there will always be a possibility of threat to the security of the inmates of the hotel, which will affect
inflow of tourist in the area and have adverse impact on the economy of the State.

9. Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior counsel for the Goa Foundation, referred to notification dated
29.10.1980 and agreement dated 26.10.1983 to show that the land in dispute was acquired for
execution of work for the benefit of general public and argued that the High Court did not commit
any error by recording a finding that the acquisition was under Section 40(1)(b). She pointed out
that the land was acquired with the sole object of enabling appellant No.1 to develop sports and
recreational facilities/amenities which could be used by the occupants of the hotel rooms as also the
general public and argued that the same cannot be said to be for the purposes of the company. Ms.
Jaising emphasised that on the date of acquisition, the appellant No.1 had already constructed the
hotel and argued that in the garb of creating facilities and amenities for the occupants of the hotel
rooms, it could not have extended hotel building on 1000 sq. meters of plot bearing survey No.803,
and that too in violation of the express bar contained in Clause 4(viii) of agreement dated
26.10.1983. She argued that order dated 20.4.1992 passed by the Development Authority permitting
construction on plot bearing survey No.803 is liable to be ignored in view of Clause 4(viii) of the
agreement. She further argued that even if this Court comes to the conclusion that appellant no.1
could construct building on survey No.803 by way of extension of the existing hotel, the disputed
construction cannot be saved because permission of the EDC was not obtained. Ms. Jaising invoked
the doctrine of public trust and argued that in view of the unequivocal condition incorporated in
Clause 4(ix) of the agreement that access to the beach will be maintained without any obstruction,
right of the members of public to go to the beach through survey No.803 cannot be stultified by
putting up wall/barbed wire fencing or by creating any other impediment. Learned senior counsel
submitted that the beach in question is not a private beach and, therefore, the public at large cannot
be denied the right to access the beach. She further submitted that if appellants are allowed to
prevent the public from going to the beach through the traditional path from Dona-Paola-Bambolim
Road through survey Nos.792 and 803, the same would amount to privatization of the public beach,
which is legally impermissible. As regards the judgment in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986, Ms.
Jaising submitted that the same is not relevant for deciding the issues raised in these appeals
because neither any of the writ petitioners nor the State Government were parties to that litigation

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 14Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

and, in any case, in view of the unequivocal stipulation contained in Clause 4(ix) of the agreement,
appellant No.1 cannot wriggle out of its statutory obligation to maintain passage through plot
bearing survey No.803. She countered the submission of Shri Divan that in view of the availability of
alternative access to the beach through the road, car parking and footpath constructed by appellant
No.1, the High Court should not have insisted on continuing access to the beach through survey No.
803 by asserting that the said access has been provided in terms of letter dated 1.8.1978 of the Chief
Town Planner and permission granted by the Gram Panchayat vide letter dated 22.8.1978 in lieu of
the access available to the public through survey No.787 and the same cannot be made basis for
depriving members of the public to continue to avail access to the beach through the traditional path
available to them survey No. 803. Learned senior counsel also pointed out that the alternative access
is totally illusory because it ends on the rocks through which no person can easily go to the beach.

10. We have considered the respective arguments/submissions. The questions which require
determination by this Court are:

(i) Whether land bearing survey Nos.803 (new No.246/2) and 804 (new No.245/2)
was acquired under Section 40(1)(aa) or it was an acquisition under Section 40(1)(b)?

(ii) Whether any public access was available to the beach through survey No.803
(new No.246/2) before its acquisition by the State Government and whether in terms
of Clause 4(ix) of the agreement, appellant No.1 is required to maintain the said
access/road to the beach, without any obstruction?

(iii) Whether public access to the beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2)
stood extinguished with the vesting of land in the State Government under Section 16
of the 1894 Act?

(iv) Whether construction of hotel building on a portion of survey No.803 (new
No.246/2) is contrary to the purpose of acquisition and is violative of the prohibition
contained in Clause 4(viii) of agreement dated 26.10.1983 and the High Court rightly
directed demolition thereof in accordance with Clause 6 of the agreement?

(v) Whether denial of the facilities and amenities created by appellant No.1 in survey
No.803 (new No.246/2) to the members of public is contrary to the purpose of
acquisition and is also violative of the agreement and this could be made a ground for
resumption of the acquisition of land?

Re: 1

11. The decision of this question depends on the interpretation of Sections 40 (1) and 41 of the 1894
Act. However, before adverting to those sections, we deem it proper to notice other relevant
provisions. Section 4 provides for publication of a preliminary notification evidencing prima facie
satisfaction of the government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any
public purpose. This section prescribes the mode of publication of notification and also indicates the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 15Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

steps which could be taken for survey etc. of the land for deciding whether the same is fit for the
purpose for which it is needed. Section 5A postulates giving of an opportunity to any person
interested in the land to raise objection against proposed acquisition and casts a duty on the
Collector to hear the objector in person and submit his report to the Government. Section 6
postulates making of a declaration containing satisfaction of the appropriate Government arrived at,
after considering the report, if any, made under Section 5A(2) that the particular land is needed for
a public purpose or for a company. This is subject to the provisions of Part VII of the Act. Section 39,
which finds place in Part VI, lays down that the provisions of Sections 6 to 37 (both inclusive) shall
not be put in force for acquiring land on behalf of a company under that part without the previous
consent of the appropriate Government, and unless the company executes an agreement in terms of
Section 41.

12. In R.L. Arora vs. State of U.P. [(1962) Suppl. 2 SCR 149] (hereinafter referred to as ‘first R.L.
Arora case’), the Constitution Bench considered the legality of the acquisition made on behalf of
Lakshmi Ratan Engineering Works Limited, Kanpur, which was engaged in manufacture of textile
machinery parts. The appellant, who was owner of the land, challenged the acquisition on the
ground that it was not for a public purpose. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the
impugned acquisition cannot be treated to have been made under Section 40(1)(b), merely because
the products of the company, for which land is sought to be acquired will be useful to the public. It
was urged that, if Section 40(1) is given such an interpretation, the Government will become an
agent for acquiring lands on behalf of the companies engaged in producing something which may be
used by the public. The respondents argued that Section 40(1)(b) is of wide amplitude and land can
be acquired under the Act for any company when the work set up by it is likely to prove useful to the
public. The majority of the Constitution Bench held that Section 40(1)

(b) must be read in conjunction with Section 41 to find out the intention of the legislature when it
provides for acquisition of land for a company through the agency of the Government, and rejected
the argument of the respondents by making the following observations:

sevseeneuves If we were to give the wide interpretation contended for on behalf of the respondents on the
relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 it would amount to holding that the legislature intended the
Government to be a sort of general agent for companies to acquire lands for them, so that there
owners may make profits. It can hardly be denied that a company which will satisfy the definition of
that word in s. 3(e) will be producing something or other which will be useful to the public and
which the public may need to purchase. So on the wide interpretation contended for on behalf of the
respondents, we must come to the conclusion that the intention of the legislature was that the
Government should be an agent for acquiring land for all companies for such purposes as they might
have provided the product intended to be produced is in a general manner useful to the public, and
if that is so there would be clearly no point in providing the restrictive provisions in ss. 40 and 41.
The very fact therefore that the power to use the machinery of the Act for the acquisition of land for
a company is conditioned by the restrictions in ss. 40 and 41 indicates that the legislature intended
that land should be acquired through the coercive machinery of the Act only for the restricted
purpose mentioned in ss. 40 and 41, which would also be a public purpose for the purpose of s. 4.

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 16Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

"Let us therefore turn to the words of s. 40(1)(b), which says that acquisition should be for some
work which is likely to prove useful to the public. Now if the legislature intended these words to
mean that even where the product of the work is useful to the public, land can be acquired for the
company for that purpose, the legislature could have easily used the words "the product of" before
the words "such work". The very fact that there is no reference to the product of the work in s.
40(1)(b) shows that when the legislature said that the work should be likely to prove useful to the
public it meant that the work should be directly useful to the public through the public being able to
use it instead of being indirectly useful to the public through the public being able to use its product.
We have no doubt therefore that when s. 40(1)(b) says that the work should be useful to the public it
means that it should be directly useful to the public which should be able to make use of it. This
meaning in our opinion is made perfectly clear by what is provided in the fifth term in s. 41. Before
the machinery of the Act can be put into operation to acquire land for a company, the Government
has to take an agreement from the company, and that agreement must provide, where acquisition is
needed for the construction of some work and that work is likely to prove useful to the public, the
terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. ........ "

13. With a view to over come the difficulty created in the acquisition of land for private companies
on account of the judgment in first R.L. Arora's case, Clause (aa) was inserted in Section 40(1) by the
Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1961. Section 40 (as it stands after 1961 amendment) and
Sections 41 and 42 of the 1894 Act read as under:

"40. Previous enquiry. - (1) Such consent shall not be given unless the appropriate Government be
satisfied either on the report of the Collector under section 5A, sub- section (2), or by an enquiry
held as hereinafter provided, 
(a) that the purpose of the acquisition is to obtain land for the erection of dwelling houses for
workmen employed by the Company or for the provision of amenities directly connected therewith,
or (aa) that such acquisition is needed for the construction of some building or work for a Company
which is engaged or is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or work which is for a public
purpose, or

(b) that such acquisition is needed for the construction of some work, and that such work is likely to
prove useful to the public.

(2) Such enquiry shall be held by such officer and at such time and place as the appropriate
Government shall appoint.

(3) Such officer may summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel the production of
documents by the same means and, as far as possible, in the same manner as is provided by the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) in the case of a Civil Court.

41. Agreement with appropriate Government. - If the appropriate Government is satisfied after
considering the report, if any, of the Collector under section 5A, sub- section (2), or on the report of

the officer making an inquiry under section 40 that the proposed acquisition is for any of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 17Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

purposes referred to in clause (a) or clause (aa) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 40], it shall
require the Company to enter into an agreement with the appropriate Government, providing to the
satisfaction of the appropriate Government for the following matters, namely :- (1) the - payment to
the appropriate Government of the cost of the acquisition; (2) the transfer, on such payment, of the
land to the Company. (3) the terms on which the land shall be held by the Company, (4) where the
acquisition is for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses or the provision of amenities connected
therewith, the time within which, the conditions on which and the manner in which the dwelling
houses or amenities shall be erected or provided;

(4A) where the acquisition is for the construction of any building or work for a Company which is
engaged or is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or work which is for a public purpose,
the time within which, and the conditions on which, the building or work shall be constructed or
executed; and (5) where the acquisition is for the construction of any other work, the time within
which and the conditions on which the work shall be executed and maintained and the terms on
which the public shall be entitled to use the work.

42. Publication of agreement.- Every such agreement shall, as soon as may be after its execution, be
published in the Official Gazette, and thereupon (so far as regards the terms on which the public
shall be entitled to use the work) have the same effect as if it had formed part of this Act."

14. In this case, we are not concerned with Clause (a) of Section 40(1) because the land in survey
Nos.803 (new No.246/2) and 8042 (new No. 245/2) was not acquired for erection of dwelling
houses for workmen employed by appellant No.1 or for provision of amenities directly connected
therewith.

15. The dispute between the parties centers round the remaining two clauses of Section 40(1).
According to the appellants, the acquisition was under Clause (aa), whereas writ-petitioners (private
respondents herein) pleaded that the acquisition was under Clause (b). A careful reading of the two
clauses shows that while Clause (aa) envisages acquisition for the construction of some building or
work for a company which is engaged or is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or work
which is for a public purpose, Clause (b) refers to acquisition for construction of some work which is
likely to prove useful to the public. The difference in the language of the two clauses clearly brings
out this distinction. In the second part of Clause (aa), the legislature has used the expression “in any
industry or work which is for a public purpose’. This means that the particular acquisition can be
treated to have been made under that clause if it is for construction of some building or work for a
company which is engaged or is likely to engage itself in any industry or work which may not
necessarily be useful to the public in general. As against this, usefulness of the construction of some
work to the general public is sine qua non for acquisition under Clause (b). The expression "public
purpose" used in Clause (aa) was interpreted in R.L. Arora vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & others
[1964] 6 SCR 784] (herein after referred to "second R.L. Arora's case") which was instituted by the
land owner for striking down the amendment made in 1961 for validating the acquisition, which was
quashed in the first R.L. Arora's case. It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that even if the
amendment was not treated ultra vires the provisions of the Constitution, the disputed acquisition is
liable to be annulled because the condition prescribed in Clause (aa) of Section 40(1) was not

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 18Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

fulfilled, inasmuch as the acquisition was not for a public purpose. It was submitted that unless
there was any direct connection or close nexus between the articles produced by the company and
general good of the public, the impugned acquisition cannot be treated as covered by Clause (aa).
The majority of the Constitution Bench rejected this argument and held:
"In approaching the question of construction of this clause, it cannot be forgotten that the
amendment was made in consequence of the decision of this Court in R.L. Arora case and the
intention of Parliament was to fill the lacuna, which, according to that decision, existed in the Act in
the matter of acquisitions for a company .... Further, a literal interpretation is not always the only
interpretation of a provision in a statute and the court has to look at the setting in which the words
are used and the circumstances in which the law came to be passed to decide whether there is
something implicit behind the words actually used which would control the literal meaning of the
words used in a provision of the statute.

Therefore, we have to see whether the provision in clause (aa) bears another construction also in the
setting in which it appears and in the circumstances in which it was put on the statute book and also
in view of the language used in the clause. The circumstances in which the amendment came to be
made have already been mentioned by us and the intention of Parliament clearly was to fill up the
lacuna in the Act which became evident on the decision of this Court in R.L. Arora case... . It was
only for such a company that land was to be acquired compulsorily and the acquisition was for the
construction of some building or work for such a company i.e. a company engaged or about to be
engaged in some industry or work which is for a public purpose. In this setting it seems to us
reasonable to hold that the intention of Parliament could only have been that land should be
acquired for such building or work for a company as would subserve the public purpose of the
company; it could not have been intended, considering the setting in which clause (aa) was
introduced, that land could be acquired for a building or work which would not subserve the public
purpose of the company .... Further, acquisition is for the construction of some building or work for
a company and the nature of that company is that it is engaged or is taking steps for engaging itself
in any industry or work which is for a public purpose. When therefore the building or work is for
such a company it seems to us that it is reasonable to hold that the nature of the building or work to
be constructed takes colour from the nature of the company for which it is to be constructed. We are
therefore of opinion that the literal and mechanical construction for which the petitioner contends is
neither the only nor the true construction of clause (aa) and that when clause (aa) provides for
acquisition of land needed for construction of some building or work it implicitly intends that the
building or work which is to be constructed must be such as to subserve the public purpose of the
industry or work in which the company is engaged or is about to be engaged. In short, the words
“building or work’ used in clause (aa) take their colour from the adjectival clause which governs the
company for which the building; or work is being constructed .. . . It is only in these cases where the
company is engaged in an industry or work of that kind and where the building or work is also
constructed for a purpose of that kind, which is a public purpose, that acquisition can be made
under clause (aa). As we read the clause we are of opinion that the public purpose of the company

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 19Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

for which acquisition is to be made cannot be divorced from the purpose of the building or work and
it is not open for such a company to acquire land under clause (aa) for a building or work which will
not subserve the public purpose of the company".

16. The same question was again considered in State of West Bengal and another vs. Surendra Nath
Bhattacharya and another [(1980) 3 SCC 237]. In that case, acquisition was made on behalf of a
company which was carrying on the business of manufacturing of sodium silicate, plaster of paris
etc. The manufactured goods of the company were widely used all over India, saving large amount of
foreign exchange which was earlier used for importing similar goods. The Division Bench of Calcutta
High Court quashed the acquisition on the ground that it was not for a public purpose. After
noticing the majority judgment in second R.L. Arora's case, the Court held:
"The effect of the observations made above leads to the irresistible conclusion that the words "public
purpose" are not to be interpreted in a restricted sense but takes colour from the nature of the
industry itself, the articles that it manufactures and the benefit to the people that it subserves. This
Court clearly indicated that the land should be acquired for building or work which would serve the
public purpose of the company and not public purpose as it is generally understood. In the instant
case, we have also set out the nature of the products of the company and have stressed the fact that
the articles produced by the company are used for the benefit of the people and as it saves lot of
foreign exchange, it is unmistakably for the general good of the country particularly from the
economic point of view. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the object of the company in
extending its operations by enlarging the area of its production was not for the public purpose of the
company. Taking an overall picture of the nature of the products of the company, its various
activities, the general public good that it seeks to achieve and the great benefit that the people
derive, it cannot be said that the acquisition, in the present case, was not for a public purpose.
According to the test laid down by this Court, it is sufficient if it is shown that the building sought to
be built or the work undertaken subserves the public purpose of the company which is completely
fulfilled in this case."

17. In Pratibha Nema and others vs. State of M.P. and others [(2003) 10 SCC 626], this Court
analysed the provisions of Part II and VII of the 1894 Act, referred to the earlier judgments in
Somwanti vs. State of Punjab [AIR 1963 SC 151], second R.L. Arora's case, Jage Ram vs. State of
Haryana [(1971) 1 SCC 671], Bajirao T. Kote vs. State of Maharashtra [(1995) 2 SCC 442] and
observed:- "These decisions establish that a public purpose is involved in the acquisition of land for
setting up an industry in the private sector as it would ultimately benefit the people. However, we
would like to add that any and every industry need not necessarily promote public purpose and
there could be exceptions which negate the public purpose. But, it must be borne in mind that the
satisfaction of the Government as to the existence of public purpose cannot be lightly faulted and it
must remain uppermost in the mind of the court.

Thus the distinction between public purpose acquisition and Part VII acquisition has got blurred
under the impact of judicial interpretation of relevant provisions. The main and perhaps the decisive

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 20Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

distinction lies in the fact whether the cost of acquisition comes out of public funds wholly or partly.
Here again, even a token or nominal contribution by the Government was held to be sufficient
compliance with the second proviso to Section 6 as held in a catena of decisions. The net result is
that by contributing even a trifling sum, the character and pattern of acquisition could be changed
by the Government. In ultimate analysis, what is considered to be an acquisition for facilitating the
setting up of an industry in the private sector could get imbued with the character of public purpose
acquisition if only the Government comes forward to sanction the payment of a nominal sum
towards compensation. In the present state of law, that seems to be the real position."

18. Section 41 lays down that if the appropriate Government is satisfied, after considering the report,
if any, of the Collector under Section 5A(2) or on the report of the officer making an inquiry under
Section 40, that the proposed acquisition is for any of the purposes referred to in clause (a) or (aa)
or clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 40, then it shall require the company to enter into an
agreement on the matters enumerated in Clauses 1 to 5. Clause 4(A) of Section 41, which is relatable
to an acquisition under Section 40(1)(aa), requires that the agreement must indicate the time within
which and the conditions on which the building or work shall be constructed or executed. Clause (5)
of Section 41, which is relatable to an acquisition under Section 40(1)(b), also postulates indication
of time within which work is executed or maintained and the terms on which public shall be entitled
to use the work.

19. In State of West Bengal vs. P.N. Talukdar [AIR 1965 SC 646] this Court considered a question
similar to question No.1 framed by us and observed: "..... Generally speaking the appropriate
government would not state in so many words whether it was proceeding under Clause (a), or
Clause (aa) or Clause (b). The question whether consent has been given under one clause or the
other or more than one clause has to be decided on the basis of the agreement and the notification
under Section 6. We have also no doubt that it is open to the appropriate government to give
consent on being satisfied as to one of the three clauses only or as to more than one clause. In the
present case reliance has been placed on behalf of the State Government on all the three clauses and
particularly on clauses (aa) and (b), to show that the consent was given after keeping in mind all the
three clauses of Section 40(1). The question as to which clause of Section 40(1) was acted upon by
the State Government to give consent is important because on that will depend the nature of the
agreement which has to be made under Section 41. Where the purpose of the acquisition is as
mentioned in Clause (a), the agreement has to provide for the time within which, the conditions on
which and the manner in which the dwelling houses or amenities shall be erected or provided.
Where the consent is based on Clause (aa), the agreement is to provide for the time within which
and the conditions on which, the building or work shall be constructed or executed. Where the
consent is given on the basis of Clause (b), the agreement, is to specify the time within which and the
conditions on which the work shall be executed and maintained, and the terms on which the public
shall be entitled to use the work. It will be seen from the above that there are bound to be differences
in the terms to be embodied in an agreement under Section 41 depending upon whether the consent
was given."

20. In the light of the above, we shall now consider whether on a conjoint reading of notification
dated 29.10.1980 and agreement dated 26.10.1983, acquisition of survey Nos.803 and 804 (new

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 21Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

Nos.246/2 and 245/2) can be treated as having been made under Section 40(1)(aa) or it was an
acquisition under 40(1)(b) of the 1894 Act. A brief recapitulation of the facts shows that soon after
commencing work for construction of the hotel, appellant No.1 approached the State Government
for acquisition of land comprised in various survey numbers including survey Nos.803 and 804
(new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) by indicating that the first phase of its project envisages construction of
hotel building in survey No.787 and in the second phase, it was intending to put up a yoga centre,
health club and water sports facilities in survey No.805 for promoting tourism, which will also be
useful to the general public. Appellant No.1 pointed out that two small plots bearing survey Nos.788
and 789, abutting the beach, are required for installing a first aid post and a medical aid centre,
which are necessary for beach resort hotel and for providing safety measures and facilities to the
residents of the hotel and also for the public at large, using the beach. Appellant No.1 then
submitted that for second phase of the hotel complex, it will be desirable to acquire survey Nos.803
and 804 so that the entire complex will become one composite unit. In the end, appellant No.1
indicated that the facilities provided by the hotel will be open for use to the non-residents on
membership basis. The notification issued by the State Government under Section 4(1) shows that
the land was needed for a public purpose, namely, the tourism development project - construction of
hotel at Curla, Vainguinim, Taleigao. In our view, as appellant No.1 was engaged in executing a
project of tourism development, i.e., construction of hotel along with amenities like yoga centre,
health club and water sports facilities, acquisition of survey Nos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and
245/2) was clearly relatable to its project. This is also borne out from the language of agreement
dated 26.10.1983, which records satisfaction of the Government that the land was needed for the
purpose of executing tourism development project of appellant No.1. Clause 4

(ii) of the agreement shows that appellant No.1 was required to undertake the work of creation of
sports and recreational facilities / amenities within one year of getting possession and complete the
same within three years. This work was certainly ancillary to the tourism development project being
executed by appellant No.1. Therefore, there is no escape from the conclusion that the acquisition
was under Section 40(1)(aa) of the 1894 Act and the contrary finding recorded by the High Court is
legally unsustainable. It is also necessary to bear in mind that tourism is an important industrial
activity in Goa which attracts tourists from all over the country and abroad. A huge amount of
foreign exchange is generated by this industry apart from providing employment and ancillary
benefits to a large section of the population of the State. Therefore, acquisition of land for tourism
development project is certainly for a public purpose.

Re: 2

21. For deciding the question whether public access to the beach was available through survey
No.803 (new No.246/2) before its acquisition in the year 1980, it will be profitable to notice the
pleadings of the parties and contents of the documents produced by them. In all the writ petitions,
the petitioners claimed that there exists passage through survey No.803 which is being used by the
public for many years for going to the beach. In para 6 of his writ petition, Minguel Martins referred
to the affidavit of Avdhut Kamat filed by appellant No.2 in civil suit for a decree of pre- emption
instituted by Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and two others. In other two petitions, the writ
petitioners relied on the averments contained in the written statement filed on behalf of appellant

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 22Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A to support their assertion regarding existence of access to
the beach through survey No.803. Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto also placed on record a copy of the
affidavit of Avdhut Kamat and plan prepared by him showing access to the beach from point *A' to
*B' in survey No.803. In that plan starting point of access from the beach was at point *B' in survey
No.803 and it ended at point *A' touching northern boundary of that survey number towards
Machado's Cove.

22. In paragraphs 2F to 20, 2R, 2S, 3E and 3H of the written statement filed on behalf of appellant
No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A, the following averments were made:

"2F. As shown before, the properties 803, 804, 787, 788, 789 and 805 are bounded on the South by
seashore beyond which the river zuari lies. A part of this shore which forms the boundary to the said
properties is used as public way. This public way after passing through the seashore and some
private road goes upto Dona Paula jotty. This, public way is used by the members of the public
including the fisher folk to go from th said seashore upto Dona Paula jetty and vice-versa, from time
immemorial, without objection whosoever, openly, peacefully and continuously and as a matter of
right.

2G. The beach existing at the south of property 803 and 787 is a public resort and it is visited by
members of the public from all parts of llhas Taluka. For this purpose there is a ramp (stone
construction) built on the ground in property 803 as a means of access to the beach. There is also a
similar ramp in the property 787. The existence of the ramps and the date of their construction is
lost in antiquity but has been known to exist at least for the last seventy years.

2H. In order to have access to the portion of the beach existing in the property 803, there is a
footpath starting from the ramp and going towards North upto the culvert linking property 803 with
property 792 of Machado therefrom after crossing the property of Machado in the same direction, it
touches the public footpath going from Dona Paula to Calapur. At present, the said footpath touches
the Panaji-Dona Paula-Bambolim road and crosses the property of Machado.

2I. The way mentioned in the proceeding para 2H is being used by members of the public living in
the village Calapur and also by other members of the public coming from different parts of Taluka
Ilhas. This way is clearly visible on site. 2J. The Plaintiffs family have access to the properties 803,
804, 788 and 789 through the said way mentioned in para 2H and they have been using this access
for the last fifty years. The family of the Plaintiffs have their residential house at St. Cruz village and
this way in the nearest way for them.

2K. The access to the property 788 and 789 of the Plaintiff's family is through the property 803 and
through the portion of the beach used as a public way and standing on the Southern side.

2L. The access to the property 804 is through the property 803 and for that purpose there exists a
culvert.

2M. The access to the property 806 is in the continuation of the way leading from 803 and 804 and
then going to the beach and to property 806. 806 has also direct access to the seashore which is
used as public way.

2N. It is not true that that the way to 806 goes from property 805 as represented in the map
annexed to the Plaint.

20. The access to the property 807 is through the property of Machadio Survey No. 792 and more
particularly the way which goes just in line with the Eastern boundary of property of Machado. This
latter was given access also to property 806 after passing through properties which stand at the East
of property 807 and 805. As represented in the map annexed to the Plaint, 807 has access through
804 and 803.

2R. The members of the public coming through the way mentioned in Para 2P were using either the
portion of beach in property 787 or portion of beach in property 803. Whenever they were using the
ramp existing in the property 803, they used the way which connects the footpath mentioned in
Para 2P with the footpath stated in Para 2H and thereafter they were going to the ramp through the
way to 2 (H).

28. The ways mentioned in Para 2F, 2H and 2P have been used by the members of the public and
villagers from immemorial times, openly, peacefully, continuously in order to come to the beach and
they are public ways and have been so dedicated as is evidenced by the long and continuous user.

"3E. From this parking place a footpath is maintained alongside the Eastern boundary of property
787 and Western boundary of property 803 going to the south upto the Sea Shore.

3H. The Plaintiffs have not come to the Court with clean hands and hence deliberately omitted to
represent in the map annexed to the plaint the ramps existing in the properties 787 and 803 and
giving access to the beach. Similarly the Plaintiffs have deliberately omitted to represent in the map
the public way mentioned in Para 2H and 3E, the Plaintiffs have further deliberately, in order to
snatch injunction, wrongly represented the way mentioned in 2(k)."

[Emphasis added]
23. Along with the written statement, appellant No.2 filed affidavit of Shri Avdhut Kamat, who was
engaged as consulting engineer for the hotel project. In paragraph 2 of his affidavit, Shri Kamat

stated as under:

"2. I say that under instructions from said Fomento, I have prepared a plan of property bearing
survey No. 787 to 807. The properties with survey No.787, 790, 798, 800, 801, 802 and 805 have

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 24Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

been purchased by said Fomento from Defendants No.2 to

5. The plan has been drawn by me taking into consideration the old survey, new survey and present
position on the site. The new numbers of the survey are also shown in the plan. On the said plan, I
have shown existing public pathways by red pencil lines. From the said plan it appears that none of
the Defendant's lands (all of which are hatched on the plan) are, in fact, enclosed property, since all
of them have access to public ways. The pathways marked red in the plan have been personally
checked by me with the assistance of my assistants Engineers and can be verified on the site."

[Emphasis added] The affidavit of Shri Kamat was accompanied by the plan marked as Exhibit-A
which depicted various pathways including the one going from the beach to Dona-Paola-Bambolim
Road through survey Nos.803 and 792.

24. In the reply affidavit filed in Writ Petition No.141/1992, appellant No.1 did not dispute the
correctness of the written statement filed in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A or the affidavit of Shri
Avdhut Kamat and plan prepared by him after personally inspecting the site. The High Court relied
on the averments contained in the written statement and held that the existence of public access to
the beach/pathway leading to the beach through survey No.803 cannot be doubted.

25. Shri Anil Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants heavily relied on judgment
dated 13.3.2006 passed by Civil Judge, Panaji in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986 - Alvaro De Souza
Machado and another v. Sociedade De Fomento Industrial Pvt. Ltd. and another and argued that the
finding recorded by the High Court on the issue of existence of public access to the beach through
survey No.803 should be treated as redundant because the same is entirely based on admissions
made in the written statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A
and the competent court has found that the same are not binding on the appellants (who were
defendants in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986). He pointed out that learned Civil Judge, Panaji has
found that written statement was not verified by the concerned person on personal knowledge and,
therefore, admissions made therein cannot be made basis for recording an adverse finding against
the defendants in the suit. In the first blush, this argument of the learned senior counsel appears
attractive but on a closure scrutiny, we do not find any merit in it. The learned Civil Judge who
decided the suit filed by Alvaro De Souza Machado and another relied upon the judgments of this
Court in Nagubai Ammal & others v. B. Shama Rao & others (supra) and of the Allahabad High
Court in Anurag Misra vs. Ravindra Singh and another (supra) and held that the admissions made
in the earlier suit in paragraphs 2A, 2C, 2E, 2F to 28, etc. cannot be treated as binding on the
defendants because contents of the written statement were verified by using the words "true to the
best of my information which I believe as true" and not on personal knowledge. This approach of the
learned Civil Judge was clearly contrary to Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which
provides for verification of pleadings. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 lays down that save as otherwise
provided, by any law for the time being in force, every pleading shall be verified at the foot by the
party or by one of parties pleading or by some other person proved to the satisfaction of the court to
be acquainted with the facts of the case. Sub-rule (2) lays down that the person verifying shall
satisfy, by reference to the numbered paragraphs of the pleadings, what he verifies of his own
knowledge and what he verifies upon the information received and believed to be true. Sub-rule (3)

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 25Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

requires that the verification shall be signed by the person making it and shall state the date on
which and the place at which it was signed. By amending Act No. 46/1999 the requirement of filing
an affidavit by the person verifying the pleadings was incorporated but that provision does not have
any bearing on this case.

26. The plain language of Order VI Rule 15(2) makes it clear that the pleadings can be verified by the
concerned person on his own knowledge or upon the information received and believed to be true by
him/her. The written statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A
was verified by Smt. Anju Timblo who represented the appellants cause before various functionaries
of the State Government and its instrumentalities and also filed reply affidavits in different writ
petitions. Smt. Anju Timblo did not claim that she is acquainted with the topography/geography of
the area which included survey Nos.792 and 803. Therefore, she could not have verified the written
statement containing the admission regarding existence of passage/pathway to beach through
survey No.803 on her own knowledge. Therefore, verification of the written statement containing
admission about the existence of passage through Machado's Cove and survey No.803 on the basis
of information which she believed to be true was in consonance with Order VI Rule 15(2) and the
learned Civil Judge committed an error in holding that the admissions contained in the written
statement of the earlier suit were not binding on the defendants. Another error committed by the
learned Civil Judge was that he altogether overlooked the statement made by Smt. Anju Timblo,
who appeared as a witness on behalf of the defendants in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986 and candidly
accepted in the cross-examination that the written statement filed in Special Civil Suit
No.313/1978/A contained admissions about existence of access to the beach through survey No.803.
It is also significant to note that neither the writ petitioners nor the State of Goa were parties to the
second suit and, therefore, they did not get opportunity to show that admissions contained in the
written statement of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A were rightly relied upon by
the High Court and the learned Civil Judge could not have taken a contrary view.

27. It was neither the pleaded case of the appellants before the High Court nor it was argued on their
behalf that the admissions contained in the written statement filed in the previous suit about
existence of access to the beach from Dona-Paola- Bambolim Road through survey Nos.792
(Machado's Cove) and 803 were made under a bonafide mistake and the affidavit of Shri Avdhut
Kamat and the sketch prepared by him were contrary to the actual physical status of various survey
numbers mentioned therein. Therefore, the High Court cannot be said to have erred in relying upon
the admissions made in the written statement of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No. 313/1978/A
that there existed access to the beach through survey Nos.792 and 803 before its acquisition by the
State Government.

28. The propositions of law laid down in Nagubai Ammal's case and Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri's
case on which reliance has been placed by Shri Divan do not have any bearing on the cases in hand.
In Nagubai Ammal's case, this Court considered the legality of the sale made in execution of decree
passed on a mortgage deed. The appellants, who were defendants in the suit for declaration of title
to certain building sites, resisted the respondents’ claim based on the purchase made in execution of
mortgage decree. That suit was decreed in 1921 and the lands were purchased by the decree holder
in 1928. The mortgager was adjudged an insolvent in 1926. Suit to enforce the mortgage deed was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 26Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

brought in 1933 impleading the official receiver and the purchaser in execution of the maintenance
and charge decree, but the appellants were not impleaded as parties. In execution of the decree
passed in the second suit, the lands were sold to a third party. The respondents' father purchased
the land in 1938 from the said third party. The learned District Judge held that the appellants’ title
acquired by the purchase of 1920 stood extinguished by the sale held in execution of the charge
decree by operation of Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. Before the Supreme Court, the
appellants relied on the admission made by Abdul Huq (predecessors of respondents), and the
respondents themselves that the decree and sale in the suit instituted in 1920 were collusive. While
rejecting the argument, this Court observed:

"An admission is not conclusive as to the truth of the matters stated therein. It is only a piece of
evidence, the weight to be attached to which must depend on the circumstances under which it is
made. It can be shown to be erroneous or untrue, so long as the person to whom it was made has not
acted upon it to his detriment, when it might become conclusive by way of estoppel. In the present
case, there is no question of estoppel, as the title of Dr. Nanjunda Rao arose under a purchase which
was longer prior to the admissions made in 1932 and in the subsequent years. It is argued for the
appellants that these admissions at the least shifted the burden on to the plaintiff of proving that the
proceedings were not collusive, and that as he gave no evidence worth the name that these
statements were made under a mistake or for a purpose and were, in fact, not true, full effect must
be given to them. Reliance was placed on the well-known observations of Baron Park in Slatterie v.
Pooley [[1840] 6 M. & W. 664, 669; 151 E.R. 579, 581], that "what a party himself admits to be true
may reasonably be presumed to be so", and on the decision in Rani Chandra Kunwar v. Chaudhri
Narpat Singh : Rani Chandra Kunwar v. Rajah Makund Singh [[1906- 07] L.R. 34 L.A. 27], where
this statement of the law was adopted. No exception can be taken to this proposition. But before it
can be invoked, it must be shown that there is a clear and unambiguous statement by the opponent,
such as will be conclusive unless explained. It has been a already pointed out that the tenor of the
statements made by Abdul Hug, his legal representatives and the plaintiff was to suggest that the
proceedings in O. S. No. 100 of 1919-20 were fraudulent and not collusive in character. Those
statements would not, in our opinion, be sufficient, without more, to sustain a finding that the
proceedings were collusive."

In Anurag Misra's case (supra), the learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court held that
vague allegations about the ownership of the premises made by the tenant in his written statement
filed in a suit for eviction cannot be treated as admission about the contract of tenancy with the
plaintiff/landlord and the tenant cannot be estopped from subsequently disputing the relationship
of landlord and tenant by pleading that somebody else is the owner of the premises in question.

29. In neither of the afore-mentioned cases, this Court or Allahabad High Court considered whether
unequivocal admission made by a party in a contemporaneous litigation can be ignored on the
ground of so-called defect in verification. That apart, as we have already found, verification of the
written statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No. 313/1978/A was in
conformity with Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the High Court rightly relied
upon the same for holding that existence of public access to the beach through survey No.803 (new
No.246/2) cannot be doubted.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 27Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

30. The appellants attempt to confuse the existence of access to the beach from point *A' to *B' in
survey No.803 with the so-called access running along side nallah deserves to be discarded because
no such case was projected before the High Court and no argument was advanced on that score. It is
also worth mentioning that in his letter dated 1.12.1978 the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat had
made a specific mention of public footpath which runs on survey No.787 and forms the boundary of
survey No.803 and the parking area which was shown as situated on the Northeast corner of survey
No.787 adjacent to survey No.803. There is no mention in any of the documents of the so-called
access along side the nallah dividing survey No.803 (new No.246/2) on the one hand and survey
Nos.804 and 805 on the other hand.

31. Once it is held that there existed public access to the beach through survey No.803 (new
No.246/2) before its acquisition by the State Government in 1980, the appellants are duty bound to
act in accordance with Clause 4(ix) of the agreement, which has the force of law by virtue of Section
42 of the 1894 Act. That clause casts a duty on appellant No.1 to maintain access to the beach
without obstruction of any kind whatsoever. The argument of Shri Anil Divan and Shri Pallav
Shishodia, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants and the State of Goa respectively,
that the Court may relieve the appellants of the obligation to maintain access to the beach through
survey No.803 (new No.246/2) because an alternative access has been provided by constructing
road, parking area and public footpath, in furtherance of the permission accorded by the Gram
Panchayat for construction of hotel in survey No. 787, cannot be accepted for the simple reason that
the agreement was executed between the President of India and appellant No.1 in the backdrop of
acquisition of survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and 804 (new No.245/2) and survey No.787 on which
the hotel was constructed has nothing to do with the acquisition proceedings. Therefore, the
alternative road, parking and public footpath provided by appellant No.1 in lieu of the access
available through survey No.787 cannot be made basis for depriving members of the public of their
age old right to go to the beach through survey No.803 (new No. 246/2).

32. The matter deserves to be considered from another angle. The public trust doctrine which has
been invoked by Ms. Indira Jaising in support of her argument that the beach in question is a public
beach and the appellants cannot privatize the same by blocking/obstructing traditional access
available through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) is implicitly engrafted by the State Government in
Clause 4(ix) of the agreement. That doctrine primarily rests on the principle that certain resources
like air, sea, waters and the forests have such a great importance to the people as a whole that it
would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership. These resources are gift of
nature, therefore, they should be freely available to everyone irrespective of one's status in life. The
public trust doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of the
general public rather than to permit their use for private ownership or commercial purposes. This
doctrine puts an implicit embargo on the right of the State to transfer public properties to private
party if such transfer affects public interest, mandates affirmative State action for effective
management of natural resources and empowers the citizens to question ineffective management
thereof. The heart of the public trust doctrine is that it imposes limits and obligations upon
government agencies and their administrators on behalf of all the people and especially future
generations. For example, renewable and non-renewable resources, associated uses, ecological
values or objects in which the public has a special interest (i.e. public lands, waters, etc.) are held

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 28Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

subject to the duty of the State not to impair such resources, uses or values, even if private interests
are involved. The same obligations apply to managers of forests, monuments, parks, the public
domain and other public assets. Professor Joseph L. Sax in his classic article "The Public Trust
Doctrine in Natural Resources Law: Effective Judicial Intervention" (1970), indicates that the Public
Trust Doctrine, of all concepts known to law, constitutes the best practical and philosophical
premise and legal tool for protecting public rights and for protecting and managing resources,
ecological values or objects held in trust. The Public Trust Doctrine is a tool for exerting
long-established public rights over short-term public rights and private gain. Today, every person
exercising his or her right to use the air, water, or land and associated natural ecosystems has the
obligation to secure for the rest of us the right to live or otherwise use that same resource or
property for the long term and enjoyment by future generations. To say it another way, a landowner
or lessee and a water right holder has an obligation to use such resources in a manner as not to
impair or diminish the people's rights and the people's long term interest in that property or
resource, including down-slope lands, waters and resources.

33. In Illinois Central Railraod Co. vs. People of the State of Illinois [146 US 387], the United States
Supreme Court considered whether the State could abdicate its general control over the sub-merged
land. In the year 1869, the Ilonois legislature made a substantial grant of sub-merged land - a mile
strip along the shores of Lake Michigan extending one mile out from the shoreline - to the Illinois
Central Railroad. This was repealed in 1869. The State of Illinois sued to quit title. The Supreme
Court while accepting the stand of the State of Illinois held that the title of the State in the land in
dispute was a title different in character from that which the State held in lands intended for sale. It
was different from the title which the United States held in public lands which were open to
pre-emption and sale. It was a title held in trust

-- for the people of the State that they may enjoy the navigation of the water, carry on commerce
over them and have liberty of fishing therein free from obstruction or interference of private parties.
The abdication of the general control of the State over lands in dispute was not consistent with the
exercise of the trust which required the Government of the State to preserve such waters for the use
of the public.

34. In Robbins vs. Deptt. of Public Works [244 NE 2d 577], the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts restrained the Public Works Department from acquiring Fowl Meadows, "wetlands of
considerable natural beauty ... often used for nature study and recreation" for highway use.

35. In National Audubon Society vs. Superior Court of Alpine County [33 Cal 3d 419], the Supreme
Court of California considered whether a permit can be granted to the Department of Water and
Power of the City of Los Angeles to appropriate water of four of the five streams flowing into Mono
Lake, which is the second largest lake in California. Some environmentalists, using the public trust
doctrine, brought law suit against Los Angeles Water Diversions. The Supreme Court of California
explained the concept of public trust doctrine in the following words:

" “By the law of nature these things are common to mankind -- the air, running water, the sea and
consequently the shores of the sea.' (Institutes of Justinian 2.1.1) From this origin in Roman law, the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 29Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

English common law evolved the concept of the public trust, under which the sovereign owns “all of
its navigable waterways and the lands lying beneath them as trustee of a public trust for the benefit
of the people.'"

While dealing with the State's power as a trustee of public property, the Court observed:
"Thus, the public trust is more than an affirmation of State power to use public property for public
purposes. It is an affirmation of the duty of the State to protect the people's common heritage of
streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands, surrendering that right of protection only in rare cases
when the abandonment of that right is consistent with the purposes of the trust..."

The Court recorded its conclusion in the following words:
"The State has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in the planning and
allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust uses whenever feasible. Just as the history
of this State shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite
unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system
administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm
to trust interests. (See Johnson, 14 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 233, 256-57/; Robie, Some Reflections on
Environmental Considerations in Water Rights Administration, 2 Ecology L.Q. 695, 710-711 (1972);
Comment, 33 Hastings L.J. 653, 654.) As a matter of practical necessity the State may have to
approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the
State must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust (see
United Plainsmen v. N.D. State Water Cons. Comm'n [247 NW 2d 457 (ND 1976)] at pp.462-463,
and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust."

36. The Indian society has, since time immemorial, been conscious of the necessity of protecting
environment and ecology. The main moto of social life has been "to live in harmony with nature".
Sages and Saints of India lived in forests. Their preachings contained in Vedas, Upanishadas,
Smritis etc. are ample evidence of the society's respect for plants, trees, earth, sky, air, water and
every form of life. It was regarded as a sacred duty of every one to protect them. In those days,
people worshipped trees, rivers and sea which were treated as belonging to all living creatures. The
children were educated by their parents and grandparents about the necessity of keeping the
environment clean and protecting earth, rivers, sea, forests, trees, flora fauna and every species of
life.

The Constitution of India, which was enforced on 26th January, 1950 did not contain any provision
obligating the State to protect environment and ecology, but the people continued to treat it as their
social duty to respect the nature, natural resources and protect environment and ecology. After
almost three decades of independence, the legislature recognized the importance of protecting and
improving environment and safeguarding forests and wild life and Article 48A was inserted in Part
IV of the Constitution by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 whereby a duty was
imposed on the State to endeavour to protect and improve the environment and safeguard forests
and wild life of the country. By the same amendment Article 51A was inserted in the form of Part

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 30Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

IVA which enumerates fundamental duties of every citizen. Article 51A(g) declares that it shall be
the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests,
lakes, rivers and wild life and to have compassion for living creatures. Thereafter, the Courts
repeatedly invoked Articles 48A and 51A for protecting environment and ecology and several orders
were passed in public interest litigation mandating the State to take action for protecting forests,
rivers and anti pollution measures. The importance of the public trust doctrine was also recognized
by this Court and the same was applied for protecting natural resources which have been treated as
public properties and are held by the government as trustee of the people. In M.C. Mehta v. Kamal
Nath and others [(1997) 1 SCC 388], this Court considered whether a private company running
tourists resort in Kullu-Manali valley could block the flow of Beas river and create a new channel to
divert the river to at least 1 kilometer down stream. After adverting to the theoretical and
philosophical basis of the public trust doctrine and some judgments on the subject, this Court
observed:

"We are fully aware that the issues presented in this case illustrate the classic struggle between those
members of the public who would preserve our rivers, forests, parks and open lands in their pristine
purity and those charged with administrative responsibilities who, under the pressures of the
changing needs of an increasingly complex society, find it necessary to encroach to some extent
upon open lands heretofore considered inviolate to change. The resolution of this conflict in any
given case is for the legislature and not the courts. If there is a law made by Parliament or the State
Legislatures the courts can serve as an instrument of determining legislative intent in the exercise of
its powers of judicial review under the Constitution. But in the absence of any legislation, the
executive acting under the doctrine of public trust cannot abdicate the natural resources and convert
them into private ownership, or for commercial use. The aesthetic use and the pristine glory of the
natural resources, the environment and the ecosystems of our country cannot be permitted to be
eroded for private, commercial or any other use unless the courts find it necessary, in good faith, for
the public good and in public interest to encroach upon the said resources.

37. In MI. Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. Radhey Shyam Sahu and others [(1999) 6 SCC 464], the Court
applied public trust doctrine for upholding the order of Allahabad High Court which quashed the
decision of Lucknow Nagar Mahapalika permitting appellant - M.I. Builders Pvt. Ltd. to construct
an underground shopping complex in Jnandewala Park, Aminabad Market, Lucknow, and directed
demolition of the construction made on the park land. The High Court noted that Lucknow Nagar
Mahapalika had entered into an agreement with the appellant for construction of shopping complex
and given it full freedom to lease out the shops and also to sign agreement on its behalf and held
that this was impermissible. On appeal by the builders, this Court held that the terms of agreement
were unreasonable, unfair and atrocious. The Court then invoked the public trust doctrine and held
that being a trustee of the park on behalf of the public, the Nagar Mahapalika could not have
transferred the same to the private builder and thereby deprived the residents of the area of the
quality of life to which they were entitled under the Constitution and Municipal Laws.

38. In Intellectuals Forum, Tirupathi vs. State of A.P. and others [(2006) 3 SCC 549], this Court
again invoked the public trust doctrine in a matter involving the challenge to the systematic

destruction of percolation, irrigation and drinking water tanks in Tirupati town, referred to some

judicial precedents including M.C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath (supra), M.I. Builders Pvt. Ltd. (supra),
National Audubon Society (supra), and observed:

"This is an articulation of the doctrine from the angle of the affirmative duties of the State with
regard to public trust. Formulated from a negatory angle, the doctrine does not exactly prohibit the
alienation of the property held as a public trust. However, when the State holds a resource that is
freely available for the use of the public, it provides for a high degree of judicial scrutiny on any
action of the Government, no matter how consistent with the existing legislations, that attempts to
restrict such free use. To properly scrutinise such actions of the Government, the courts must make
a distinction between the Government's general obligation to act for the public benefit, and the
special, more demanding obligation which it may have as a trustee of certain public resources
[Joseph L. Sax "The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial
Intervention", Michigan Law Review, Vol. 68, No. 3 (Jan. 1970) pp.471-566]. According to Prof. Sax,
whose article on this subject is considered to be an authority, three types of restrictions on
governmental authority are often thought to be imposed by the public trust doctrine [ibid]:

1. the property subject to the trust must not only be used for a public purpose, but it must be held
available for use by the general public;

2. the property may not be sold, even for fair cash equivalent;

3. the property must be maintained for particular types of use (i) either traditional uses, or (ii) some
uses particular to that form of resources."

39. The Court then held that the government orders are violative of principle Nos.1 to 3, mentioned
in the article of Professor Joseph L. Sax and directed that no further construction be made in Peruru
and Avilala tanks and corrective measures be taken for recharging them.

40. We reiterate that natural resources including forests, water bodies, rivers, sea shores, etc. are
held by the State as a trustee on behalf of the people and especially the future generations. These
constitute common properties and people are entitled to uninterrupted use thereof. The State
cannot transfer public trust properties to a private party, if such a transfer interferes with the right
of the public and the Court can invoke the public trust doctrine and take affirmative action for
protecting the right of people to have access to light, air and water and also for protecting rivers, sea,
tanks, trees, forests and associated natural eco-systems.

41. As a sequel to the above discussion, we hold that Clause 4(ix) of the agreement is binding on the
appellants and appellant No.1 is under a statutory obligation to maintain access/road to the beach
through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) without any obstruction of any kind and the High Court did

not commit any error by issuing a mandamus in that regard.

42. Section 16 of the 1894 Act which constitute the foundation of the arguments of the appellants
and State that the public access to the beach, if any available, through survey No.803 (new
No.246/2) stood extinguished with the vesting of land in the State Government, reads as under:
"16. Power to take possession. - When the Collector has made an award under Section 11, he may
take possession of the land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government, free from all
encumbrances."

43. The argument of Shri Anil Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants is that
even though access to the beach may have been available through survey No.803 before its
acquisition and the general public may have been using the same as of right for going to the beach,
the said right got terminated as soon as possession of the land was taken by the government. His
further argument is that public access to the beach through survey No.803 was in the nature of
encumbrance on the land which stood extinguished on vesting of the land in the Government in
terms of Section 16 of the 1894 Act. Shri Pallav Shishodia, learned senior counsel appearing for the
State adopted this argument and emphatically submitted that access to the beach available to the
public through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) before its acquisition was obliterated once the
acquired land vested in the Government.

44. Although, no exception can be taken to the appellants coming forward with such an argument
despite the fact that in terms of Clause 4(ix) of the agreement which has, by virtue of Section 42 of
the 1894 Act, the force of law, they are required to maintain public access to the beach, we are quite
surprised with the stance adopted by the State Government. Admittedly, the agreement was
executed by appellant No.1 under Section 41 of the 1894 Act in the backdrop of acquisition of survey
No.803 (new No.246/2) and survey No.804 (new No.245/2). It is also not in dispute that in terms of
Clause 4(ix), appellant No.1 is required to maintain access to the beach without any obstruction.
This shows that despite Section 16 of the 1894 Act, the parties had consciously decided to protect the
traditional right of the members of public to go to the beach by using the existing pathway through
the acquired land. Both, the appellants and State functionaries knew that there exist public access to
the beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2), that members of public were using the same
since time immemorial and that it was necessary to protect that right. Therefore, it is not possible to
find any fault with the view taken by the High Court that access to the beach is not an encumbrance
and in any case, the traditional pathway available to the public for going to the beach through survey
No.803 (new No.246/2) cannot be treated as having been extinguished in the face of specific
provision contained in the agreement which is statutory in character.

45. In Collector of Bombay vs. Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri [AIR 1955 SC 298], a bench of three
Judges considered whether right of the State to levy assessment on the land can be treated to have
been extinguished in view of Section 16 of the 1894 Act. The Court answered the question in
negative and observed:- "Under Section 16, when the Collector makes an award ‘he may take
possession of the land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government free from all
encumbrances’. The word ‘encumbrances' in this section can only mean interests in respect of
which a compensation was made under Section 11, or could have been claimed. It cannot include the
right of the government to levy assessment on the land".

46. In State of H.P. vs. Tarsem Singh [(2001) 8 SCC 104], a two-Judge bench interpreted Section 3
of H.P. Village Common Lands Vesting and Utilization Act, 1973 and held that the common right of
grazing available to the people of the area stood extinguished with the vesting of land in the State.
The respondents who were residents of the village brought a suit in representative capacity for
declaration that the land in dispute is being used for grazing cattle, cutting fuel wood and for other
common purposes and the defendant cannot interfere with their easementary right to enjoy the
land. The trial Court decreed the suit. The appeal preferred by the state was substantially dismissed
by the first appellate Court. The High Court dismissed the second appeal and held that easementary
right of grazing cannot be treated to have vested in the State under Section 3. This Court reversed
the judgment of the High Court and dismissed the suit. After noticing the non obstante clause used
in Section 3(1) of the Act, the Court held that all interests, title and rights in the land vested in the
Gram Panchayat stood extinguished and came to be vested in the State free from all encumbrances
including the easementary right. In the course of the judgment, two-Judges bench referred to the
judgments of Allahabad and Calcutta High Courts wherein it was held that the word ‘encumbrance’
means burden or charge upon property for a claim or lien upon State or land and it would include
easementary right over the land.

47. The last mentioned judgment was considered by another bench of two- Judges in H.P. State
Electricity Board and others vs. Shiv K. Sharma and others [(2005) 2 SCC 164]. The facts of that
case were that appellant-board purchased 10.10. bighas out of the holding of one Rikhi Ram. The
sale deed specifically mentioned that respondent Nos.1 to 3 shall have access to their land from the
land of the seller. Thereafter, the State Government acquired an area of 41.06 bighas of land for
construction of 60 KW Sub-Station. The acquired land included the remaining land of Rikhi Ram
from whom respondent Nos.1 to 3 had purchased the land. After acquisition, the entire property was
fenced of by barbed wire and electric sub-station and living quarters of the employees of appellant
were also constructed thereupon. In the process, the appellant blocked off the passage being used as
access to the land of the respondents. Respondent Nos.1 to 3 unsuccessfully sued the
appellant-board for mandatory injunction to remove the barbed wire fence blocking access to their
land. On appeal, the learned District Judge reversed the judgment of the trial Court and decreed the
suit. The High Court confirmed the appellate judgment. Before this Court, reliance was placed on
the judgment in Tarsem Singh's case and it was argued that even if respondent Nos.1 to 3 had a right
of way by easement over the land of Rikhi Ram, the said land having been acquired stood vested in
the State Government under Section 16 absolutely free from all encumbrances including such
easementary right. The High Court drew a distinction between easement of an ordinary nature in
respect of which compensation could have been claimed in the land acquisition proceedings and an
easement of necessity like a right of passage and held that such right was not extinguished by reason
of acquisition. For this purpose, the High Court relied on the observations made in Nusserwanji
Rattanji Mistri's case. While confirming the High Court's verdict, the two-Judges bench observed:
"This judgment of Collector of Bombay was a judgment by a Bench of three learned Judges of this
Court. Learned counsel for the appellants drew our attention to the judgment in State of H.P.
rendered by a Bench of two learned Judges and contended that this judgment clearly holds that the
phrase "free from all encumbrances" used in Section 16 of the Act is wholly unqualified and would
include in its compass every right including an easementary right which affects the land. He
particularly drew our attention to para 10 of the judgment where the Court took the view: "All rights,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 34Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

title and interests including the easementary rights stood extinguished and all such rights, title and
interests vested in the State free from all encumbrances." In the first place, it is difficult for us to
read the judgment in Tarsem Singh case as taking a view contrary to and differing from the law laid
down by a larger Bench in Collector of Bombay. Secondly, we notice that the decision in Tarsem
Singh is not in respect of an easementary right arising out of necessity. There does not seem to be
any discussion on the said aspect of the matter in this judgment. The view taken in Collector of
Bombay therefore, appears to hold the field, particularly where the nature of easementary right
claimed is not capable of being evaluated in terms of compensation and arises out of sheer
necessity."

48. By applying the ratio of the judgments in Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri's case and H.P. State
Electricity Board's case to the facts of this case, we hold that when the State volunteered to take
possession of the land subject to the right of the members of public to access the beach through the
acquired land and a specific provision to that effect was incorporated in the agreement executed
under Section 41 (5), Section 16 of the 1894 Act cannot be invoked for nullifying the right of the
public to access the beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2).

49. We also do not find any substance in the argument of Shri Anil Divan that Court should not
insist on continuance of public access to the beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) because
the pathway going to Dona Paula-Bambolim Road which was available through survey No.792 (new
No.242/1) (Machado's Cove) does not exist any more. The premise on which Shri Divan has made
this argument, namely, non-availability of pathway through survey No.792 does not find support
from the record of these appeals. Therefore, it is neither proper nor justified for this Court to deny
the people of their traditional right of access to the beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2)
which goes to Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road by using the roads provided in survey No.792 (new
No.242/1) (Machado's Cove). Re: 4

50. For deciding this question, we shall have to again advert to the factual matrix of the case.
Appellant No.2 purchased survey Nos.787 and 805 from Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto and leased out
the same to appellant No.1. The latter obtained permission from the Gram Panchayat for
constructing hotel building in survey No.787. The construction commenced in 1978 and was
completed in May 1983. Alongside construction of the hotel building, appellant No.1 approached the
State Government for acquisition of land in various survey numbers including survey Nos.803 and
804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2). In paragraph 3 of the application addressed to Shri Shankar Laad,
Minister of Revenue, Government of Goa, appellant No.1 gave out that in the first phase of the
project hotel building was proposed to be constructed in survey No. 787 and in the second phase,
yoga centre, health club and water sports facilities were proposed to be put up in survey No.805 for
promoting tourism. In paragraph 5, appellant No.1 offered justification for acquisition of survey
Nos.788 and 789 which abut the beach. In paragraph 6, appellant No.1 pointed out that for second
phase of the hotel complex, it would be desirable to acquire survey Nos.803 and 804 which will
make the entire area one composite unit. It is thus evident that at the time of making application to
the State Government for acquisition of land, appellant No.1 did not have any proposal for
construction and/or extension of hotel building in survey No.803. The State Government initiated
acquisition proceedings by issuing notification dated 29.10.1980 under Section 4(1) of 1894 Act,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 35Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

which were finalized in 1983. After Government took possession of the acquired land, appellant No.1
entered into an agreement as per the requirement of Section 41. Clauses 3, 4 (ii), (iv), (v) and (vii) of
the agreement enumerate affirmative actions required to be taken by appellant No.1 for achieving
the object of acquisition, whereas Clause 4(i), (vi), (viii) and (ix) contain various negative covenants
including the one against the use of land for any purpose other than for which it was acquired. A
conjoint reading of these clauses unmistakably shows that appellant No.1 was to use the acquired
land only in furtherance of and for the purpose for which it was acquired, namely, creation of sports
and other recreational facilities/amenities and to maintain the same in good order and condition
and was not to use the land for any other purpose. The first part of Clause 4(viii) contains an express
embargo against construction of any building or structure on the acquired land by appellant No.1.
The second part of that clause envisages that prior approval of EDC of the Government of Goa will
be obtained before undertaking activities for its development, besides other statutory requirements
under the existing laws. The management of appellant No.1 was very much aware of the embargo
contained in first part of Clause 4(viii) against construction of any building or structure on the
acquired land and this is the reason why in the application made by Smt. Anju Timblo to the
Development Authority under Section 44(1) read with Section 49 of Town and Country Planning Act
for grant of permission for extension of the existing hotel building, survey No.246/2 was not
mentioned. The EEC and EDC considered that application and approved extension of the existing
hotel building on land in survey Nos.246/1, 246/3 and 246/4 (old Nos.787, 788 and 789) subject, of
course, to the condition of maintaining pedestrian path. The order issued by the Development
Authority on 15.4.1988 was also for extension of the existing hotel building on land bearing survey
No.246/1, 3 and 4. Neither in the minutes of EEC or EDC nor in the order issued by the
Development Authority under Section 44(3)(c) read with Section 49(2) of the Town and Country
Planning Act, there was any mention of survey No.246/2. This shows that till that stage, appellant
No.1 had consciously refrained from putting up even a proposal for constructing any building or
structure on the acquired land. For the first time a request to that effect was made in the garb of
making an application for renewal of permission granted by order dated 15.4.1988 with a deviation.
A mention of four sub-divisions of survey No. 246 (1, 2, 3 and 4) was made instead of three
sub-divisions, i.e., 1, 3 and 4. With a view to avoid scrutiny by the EEC and EDC, the appellants
managed consideration of the application for extension and deviation of hotel building by the Board
constituted under Section 4 of the Town and Country Planning Act. The Board considered and
approved extension/deviation albeit in violation of the negative covenant contained in first part of
Clause 4(viii) of the statutory agreement. While doing that, the Board was fully cognizant of the fact
that in view of Clause 4 (viii), appellant No.1 cannot use the land for constructing any structure and
also that even for undertaking any activity relating to development, approval of the EDC will be
necessary. That is why the State Government forwarded the decision of the Board to the
Development Authority for its consideration. Unfortunately, the Development Authority without
even bringing the matter to the notice of the EDC, passed order dated 20.4.1992 and permitted
appellant No.1 to carry out construction on plot bearing survey No.246/2. In our considered view,
neither the State Government nor the Board could allow extension of the hotel building on the
acquired land in violation of first part of Clause 4(viii) of agreement dated 26.10.1983 which, at the
cost of repetition, we would like to emphasise, has the force of law by virtue of Section 42 of the
1894 Act. Section 8 of the Town and Country Planning Act, which enumerates functions and powers
of the Board reads as under:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 36Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

"8. Functions and powers of Board.--(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made
thereunder, the functions of the Board shall be to guide, direct and assist the Planning and
Development Authorities, to advise the Government in matters relating to the planning,
development and use of rural and urban land in the Union Territory, and to perform such other
functions as the Government may, from time to time, assign to the Board.

(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions, the Board may,
and shall if required by the Government so to do-
(a) direct the preparation of development plans by the Planning and Development Authorities;

(b) undertake, assist and encourage the collection, maintenance and publication of statistics,
bulletins and monographs on planning and its methodology; (c ) co-ordinate and advise on the
planning and implementation of physical development programmes within the Union Territory;

(d) prepare and furnish reports relating to the working of this Act; and

(e) perform such other functions as are incidental, supplemental or consequential to any of the
functions aforesaid or which may be prescribed. (3) The Board may exercise all such powers as may
be necessary or expedient for the purpose of carrying out its functions under this Act."

51. A reading of the above reproduced section makes it clear that the Board is required to guide,
direct and assist the Planning and Development Authorities; to advise the Government in matters
relating to the planning, development and use of rural and urban land in the Union Territory, and to
perform other functions assigned to it by the Government. In terms of Section 8(2), the Board can
direct the preparation of development plans by the Planning and Development Authorities;
undertake, assist and encourage the collection, maintenance and publication of statistics, bulletins
and monographs on planning and its methodology; co-ordinate and advise on the planning and
implementation of physical development programmes and perform such other functions which are
incidental to the enumerated functions. The role of the State Government primarily relates to
approval of regional plan (S.44), revision of regional plan (S.17), declaration of planning areas, their
amalgamation, sub-divisions, etc. (S.18), power to withdraw planning area from operation of the Act
(S.19) and constitution of Planning and Development Authorities for the planning area (S.20).
Section 22, which enumerates functions and powers of Planning and Development Authority reads
as under:

"22. Functions and powers of Planning and Development Authorities.--Subject to the provisions of
this Act and the rules framed thereunder and subject to any directions which the Government may
give, the functions of every Planning and Development Authority shall be 
(a) to prepare an existing Land Use Map;

(b) to prepare an Outline Development Plan;

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 37Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

(c ) to prepare a Comprehensive Development plan;
(d) to prepare and prescribe uses of land within its area; and

(e) to prepare schemes of development and undertake their implementation, and for these purposes,
it may carry out or cause to be carried out, surveys of the planning area and prepare report or
reports of such surveys, and to perform such other functions as may be prescribed."

52. Chapter VII of the Town and Country Planning Act contains provisions relating to control of
development and use of land. Section 44 lays down that any person intending to carry out any
development in respect of, or change of use of, any land shall make an application in writing to the
Planning and Development Authority for permission in such form containing such particulars and
accompanied by such documents and plans as may be prescribed. Section 44(2)(b) and (c) deal with
the situation in which the Development Authority objects to the proposal for development, in which
case the matter has to be placed before the Government for its decision. Section 44(3) lays down
that the Development Authority can grant permission, conditionally or unconditionally for carrying
out any development or change of use of the land. While doing so, the Development Authority is
required to take note of the provisions of the development plan, if any, in force, relevant bye- laws,
regulations, etc.

53. None of the above noted provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act empowers the Board
and/or the Development Authority to modify, amend, alter or change an agreement entered into as
per the requirement of Section 41 of the 1894 Act or allow violation thereof by the company.
Therefore, the decision taken by the Board in its meeting held on 20th June, 1991 and order dated
20th April, 1992 issued by the Development Authority were non est and the High Court rightly did
not give any credence to those decisions while adjudicating the issue relating to legality of
construction made on survey No.803 (new No.246/2).

54. We are also of the opinion that even the EDC which was empowered under second part of Clause
4(viii) of the agreement to grant approval to the activities relating to development could not have
permitted construction/extension of the hotel building on a portion of survey No.803 (new
No.246/2). Any such decision by the EDC would also have been declared nullity on the ground of
violation of the mandate of first part of Clause 4(viii) of the statutory agreement.

55. The argument of Shri Divan that extension of the hotel building on 1000 sq. mts. of survey
No.803 (new No.246/2) falls within the definition of "development" contained in Section 2(10) of
the Town and Country Planning Act which comprehends carrying out of building activities and,
therefore, the High Court should not have ordered demolition of the extended portion of the hotel,
but we are unable to agree with him and reiterate that neither the Board nor the Development
Authority could sanction violation of agreement dated 26.10.1983.

56. For the reasons stated above, we hold that the High Court did not commit any error by declaring
that extension of the hotel building on 1000 sq. mts. of survey No.803 (new No.246/2) is illegal and

directed its demolition after following the procedure prescribed under Clause 6 of agreement dated

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 38Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

26.10.1983. Re: 5.

57. This question deserves to be answered in favour of the appellants. A reading of application dated
15.11.1978 made by appellant No.1 makes it clear that it had no intention of making available the
facilities of yoga centre, health club and amenities like water sports to the general public. Rather in
paragraph 6 of its application, appellant No.1 made it clear that the facilities provided by the hotel
will be open for use by non-residents also on membership basis. Agreement dated 26.10.1983 is
totally silent on the issue of making the facilities created by the appellants open for public use
without permission and payment of fees. Therefore, it is not possible to agree with Ms. Jaising that
the facilities and amenities created by the appellant should be made available to the general public
free of costs.

58. In the result, the appeals are dismissed. Since execution of most of the directions given by the
High Court remained stayed during the pendency of these appeals, we deem it proper to issue the
following directions:
(i) The appellants are allowed three months' time to demolish the extended portion of
the hotel building which was constructed on 1000 sq. mts. of survey No.803 (new
No.246/2) and, thereafter report the matter to the Development Authority which
shall, in turn, submit a report to that effect to Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court.

(ii) If the appellants fail to demolish the building and report the matter to the
Development Authority within the time specified in direction No.(i) above, the
concerned authority shall take action in accordance with paragraphs

(a) and (b) of the operative part of the High Court's order.

(iii) The access shown in plan Exhibit-A attached to Writ Petition No.141/1992 shall
be kept open without any obstruction of any kind from point *A' to ‘B' in order to
come from Machado's Cove and then go to the beach beyond point *B'. If during
pendency of the litigation, appellant No.1 has put up any obstruction or made
construction to block or hinder access to the beach through survey No.803 (new
No.246/2), then the same shall be removed within one month from today.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6074 OF 2000

Goa Foundation and another ... Appellants
Versus
Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. and others ... Respondents
JUDGMENT
SINGHVI, J.

1. This is an appeal for setting aside order dated 25.4.2000 passed by Goa Bench of the High Court
of Bombay in Writ Petition Nos. 284 of 1991 and 37 of 1992 whereby the appellants’ prayer for issue
of a direction to the respondents for restoration of public access to the Vainguinim beach and the car
parking area through survey No. 787 (new no. 246/1) and for demolition of the construction made in
the open area of the property bearing survey No. 789 (new No. 246/4) was rejected, but directions
were given for ensuring that the alternative access to the beach is kept open for public and the same
is extended up to the beach along the retaining wall so that it may directly lead to the beach and not
to the rocks or some other place. BACKGROUND FACTS:

(i) Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto owned several parcels of land in Village Taleigao, District Tiswadi, Goa.
He sold plots bearing survey Nos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) to Gustavo Renato da
Cruz Pinto and plots bearing survey Nos.787 and 805 (new Nos.246/1 and 245/1) to M/s. Sociedade
e Fomento Industries Pvt. Ltd. (respondent No.2 herein).

(ii) After purchasing the land, respondent No.2 leased out the same to respondent No.1. The latter
submitted an application to Gram Panchayat Taleigao (for short ‘the Gram Panchayat’) for grant of
permission to construct hotel complex near Vainguinim beach. On a reference made by the Gram
Panchayat, Chief Town Planner, Government of Goa, Daman and Diu vide his letter dated 1.8.1978
informed that the plans submitted by respondent No.1 are in conformity with the regulations in
force in the area but observed that right of the public to access the beach must be maintained by
providing necessary footpath. Paragraph 2 of that letter reads as under:
"The road leading to the hotel complex is at present used by general public to approach the
Vainguinim Beach which is popular picnic spot for the people of Panaji, as well as other parts of
Goa. It will need to be ensured that the right of access to the beach is maintained by the applicant by
providing the necessary footpath to the beach at an appropriate place. The parking facilities
provided will also have to take care of the parking of vehicles of such members of the public in an
appropriate manner. This will ensure that the beach remains open to public as it is at present and
that the public is not deprived of this beautiful and frequently used beach."

(iii) Thereafter, the Gram Panchayat issued letter dated 22.8.1978, whereby respondent No.1 was
permitted to lay access road linking Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road to the construction site and
construct the hotel subject to the conditions specified in the letter including the one relating to
public access to the beach. This was reiterated by the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat in his letter
dated 1.12.1978, which reads as under:

"VILLAGE PANCHAYAT OF TALEIGAO Your ref. No. Our Ref. no.VT/TLG/329/78 Dated:1.12.1978
To M/s. Gomantak land Development Pvt. Ltd., Velho Building, Panaji - Goa.

Dear Sir, I have inspected the site for the proposed hotel building and I am satisfied that the licence
holder bearing licence No.195/78 dated 22.9.1978 has complied with the condition imposed by the
letter dated 1st August, 1978 from the department of Town Planning to the Panchayat by
constructing a road as required. The said road runs up to the parking area on the spot No.787, from
west to east. The parking area is situated on the north east corner of survey No.787 adjacent to
Survey no.803. The public footpath runs on survey No.787 and forms the boundary to survey
No.803.

The interest of the public as per the condition in the letter of the Department of Town Planning of
1.8.1978 are satisfied. The road parking area and the public footpath will be open to public use and
will not be altered without our permission.

Thanking you, Yours faithfully,

(iv) In furtherance of the permission granted by the Gram Panchayat,

respondent No.1 commenced construction of the hotel, which is now known as Hotel Cidade de Goa
on the land forming part of survey No.787 (new No.246/1) and completed the same by May, 1983.

(v) During construction of the hotel building, respondent No.1 made an application dated 29.9.1979
to the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat, for permission to change the location of the footpath and
parking area by stating that in view of installation of 10,000 kg gas tank (poisonous gas at high
pressure), high pressure water tank and high voltage electric transformer near the hotel building, it

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ AtFomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

will not be in public interest to locate the footpath and parking area at the sanctioned site.

(vi) The Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat neither forwarded the application of respondent No.1 to
the Town and Planning Department nor placed the same before the Gram Panchayat. Instead, he
wrote letter dated 29.9.1979 to respondent No.1 giving an impression that the Gram Panchayat does
not have any objection to the change of location of the footpath and parking area. Thereafter,
respondent No.1 shifted access to the beach to the new site.

(vii) In the meanwhile, Shri Gustavo Renato Da Cruz Pinto, Smt. Surana Pepfira Pinto and Miss
Befta Sara Da Costa Pinto filed Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior
Division, at Panaji against respondent No.2, Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto and four others for a decree
of possession by pre-emption in respect of the land comprised in survey Nos.787 and 805 and also
to restrain the defendants, their agents, servants, etc. from changing, alienating or raising any
construction on the suit land by alleging that they were owners of property bearing survey Nos.803,
804, 806, 807, 788 and 789 situated at Taleigao and since time immemorial they and their
predecessors were using footpath passing through survey Nos.787, 805 and 769 for going to
Panaji-Dona Paula- Bambolim road, which was sought to be obstructed. Defendant No.1 in the suit
(appellant No.2 herein) filed written statement to contest the suit. After some time, the parties
compromised the matter in terms of which the plaintiffs gave up their claim for pre-emption in
respect of plot bearing survey Nos.787 and 805 and defendant No.1 agreed to exchange the plot
bearing survey No.790 with plots bearing survey Nos.788 and 789 belonging to the plaintiffs and
also that it will have no right of access through any of the properties of the plaintiffs. As a sequel to
this, the plaintiffs applied for withdrawal of the suit. By an order dated 20.12.1978, the Civil Judge
permitted them to do so.

(viii) Soon after withdrawal of the pre-emption suit, Respondent No. 1 represented to Shri Shankar
Laad, Minister of Revenue, Government of Goa for acquisition of land comprised in survey Nos.
788, 789, 803, 804, 806 and 807 of village Taleigao, Dona-Paola for construction of Beach
Resort-Hotel complex. The State Government partially accepted the request of respondent No. 1 and
issued notification dated 29.10.1980 under Section 4 (1) of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for acquiring
survey Nos. 803 and 804. After holding an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act, the State
Government issued declaration under Section 6, which was published in Gazette dated 27.10.1983.

(ix) Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and some others filed Writ Petition No. 8/1984 for quashing the
aforementioned notifications on various grounds including the one that before acquiring the land,
government did not make enquiry as per the requirement of Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition
(Companies) Rules, 1963 (for short ‘the Rules’). The writ petitioners also highlighted discrepancies
in different notifications issued by the State Government. Respondent No. 2 in the writ petition
(respondent No. 1 herein) filed reply affidavit stating therein that Rule 4 of the Rules is not
mandatory and non compliance thereof did not affect legality of the acquisition. In paragraphs 67
and 76 of the reply affidavit, it was averred that part of the project, i.e., hotel is complete and has
started functioning. In paragraph 79, it was averred that besides the hotel project, cottages were
proposed to be constructed on plot bearing survey No. 805 and the acquired land in survey Nos. 803
and 804 will be used for putting up health club, yoga centre, water sports and other recreational

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 42Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

facilities, which are integral part of the project.

(x) By an order dated 26.06.1984, Goa Bench of the High Court of Bombay allowed the writ petition
and quashed the impugned notifications only on the ground of non compliance of Rule 4 of the
Rules. That order was reversed by this Court in M/s Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. vs. Gustavo
Renato Da Cruz Pinto and Others [(1985) 2 SCC 152] and the case was remitted to the High Court
for deciding other grounds of challenge. It, however, appears that after the judgment of this Court,
the parties compromised the matter and the writ petition was withdrawn on 26.3.1985.

(xi) In the meanwhile, respondent No. 1 entered into an agreement with the Government as per the
requirement of Section 41 of the 1894 Act.

(xii) After taking possession of the acquired land, Respondent No. 1 extended the hotel building on
survey Nos. 787, 788, 789 and 803 in the garb of permission granted by the Development Authority
under the Goa, Daman and Diu Town and Country Planning Act, 1974. Respondent No. 1 also closed
public access to the beach available through survey No. 803 (new No. 246/2). The same was
challenged in Writ Petition No.330 of 1991 Shri Minguel Martins vs. M/s Sociedade e Fomento
Industries Pvt. Ltd. and others, Writ Petition No.36 of 1992 Goa Foundation and another vs.
Fomento Hotels and Resorts Limited and others and Writ Petition No.141 of 1992 Shri Gustavo
Renato da Cruz Pinto vs. State of Goa and others. By an order dated 25.4.2000 the Division Bench
of the High Court allowed the writ petitions and issued directions for demolition of the construction
made in survey No. 803 (new No. 246/2) after complying with Clause 6 of agreement dated
26.10.1983. The High Court further directed that access to the beach shown in plan Exhibit-A filed
along with Writ Petition No.141/1992 shall be kept open without obstruction of any kind.

(xiii) Shri Victor Albuquerque and the appellants herein filed another set of Writ Petition Nos. 284
of 1991 and 37 of 1992 for issue of a direction to the respondents (including respondent Nos. 1 and 2
herein) for restoration of public access to Vainguinim beach and the car parking area through survey
No. 787 (new no. 246/1) and for demolition of the construction made in the open area of survey No.
789 (new No. 246/4).

(xiv) In their writ petition, the appellants claimed that while approving the plan for construction of
hotel project in survey No. 787 (new No. 246/1), the Chief Town Planner had directed respondent
Nos. 1 and 2 to maintain access to the beach through that survey number by providing necessary
footpath and also provide facility for parking of the vehicles and this was reiterated by the Gram
Panchayat, but respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have shifted access to the beach to another location on the
basis of permission allegedly granted by the Sarpanch who had no authority to do so. According to
the appellants, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were and are not entitled to shift the public access to some
other location and, as a matter of fact, instead of ending at the beach, new road leads to the rocks
through which public cannot go to the beach. It was also the appellants’ case that the location of new
road is extremely dangerous because it is adjacent to 10,000 Kg. poisonous gas tank.

(xv) In their counter-affidavit, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 pleaded that the sanction accorded by the
Chief Town Planner was subject to the condition that public access to the beach should be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 43Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

maintained by providing necessary footpath at appropriate place and facilities should be provided
for parking of the vehicles but no particular location was identified for that purpose. It was further
their case that in the first instance, car parking was identified at North-East corner of property
bearing survey No. 787 and the footpath alongside its Eastern boundary, but during execution of the
project, it was found that existence of road near 10,000 Kg. poisonous gas tank, high pressure water
tank, electric transformer will be dangerous to the public and, therefore, application was made to
the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat for shifting the location of public road, car parking and
footpath and construction thereof at the new site was undertaken after seeking permission from the
Sarpanch. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 also pleaded that since 1979 members of the public are using
access to the beach through alternative road and footpath.

(xvi) The High Court referred to letter dated 1.8.1978 of the Chief Town Planner, letter dated
1.12.1978 of the Sarpanch, two letters dated 29th September, 1979, one of which was written by
respondent No. 1 to the Sarpanch, and the other by the Sarpanch and held that even though access
provided by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 is not at the site initially approved by the Gram Panchayat, the
same is being maintained at the new location since 1979. The High Court noted that while approving
the plan prepared by respondent No.1 for construction of hotel complex, the Chief Town Planner did
not identify the particular location at which public road, car parking and footpath were to be
constructed and even when inspection was carried out on 16th October, no objection was raised to
the change of alignment of the public road etc. and, therefore, it cannot be said that respondents
have violated the conditions of sanction. The High Court also took cognizance of the photographs
produced by the writ petitioners and observed that the access to the beach is not maintained in
proper manner and that the same leads to rocks and is inaccessible during high tide. Accordingly,
directions were issued to the respondents to maintain tarred road of three meters width throughout,
proper area for parking of cars and ensure that the access goes up to beach. However, the prayer of
the writ petitioners for demolition of the construction made in survey No. 789 (new No. 246/4) was
rejected by observing that the so-called construction is in the form of road and there is no legal
prohibition against such construction. The relevant extracts of paragraphs 12 and 13 of the
impugned order which also contain the directions given by the High Court read as under:

"All said and done, once, it is not in dispute that the members of the public are entitled to have their
access through the property bearing survey no. 787, it cannot be disputed the Respondents are duty
bound to maintain a proper access for the public to the said beach and sufficient area for parking of
cars. Both these things are to be maintained through and in the property bearing survey no. 787. It
is the contention of the Respondents that they have already provided such access and that the same
is being used by the public. However, the photographs of such access which are placed on record by
the Petitioners and not disputed by the Respondents clearly disclose that such access is not
maintained in proper manner and/or as is otherwise required to be maintained in terms of the
directions given by the Chief Town Planner. It is the contention of the Petitioners that the said
access leads not to the beach but to the rocks and the beach is absolutely unaccessable during the
hightide by the said access. The fact that members of the public cannot have access to the beach
during the high tide is also admitted by the respondents in the Affidavit-in-replies filed in both the
Petitions. In Writ Petition No. 37/92, it has been clearly stated in Affidavit-in-reply in para 20 "and
that the Respondents state that in compliance with the said condition from the point of steps, where

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 44Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

also there is a jetty the Respondents built retaining wall with access over it to the extent of 60
metres giving access over it to the public through the beach even during the high tide". Similarly, in
Writ Petition No. 284/91 in the Affidavit-in-reply it is stated in para 13(d) that "the Respondents
state that in compliance with the said condition from the point of steps where also there was a jetty,
the Respondents have built a retaining wall with access over it giving access to the public through
the beach even during the high tide." The Affidavit-in-reply in Writ Petition No. 284/91 was filed in
September, 1991 whereas the Affidavit-in-reply in Writ Petition No. 37/92 was filed in January,
1992. This clearly shows that the Respondents are fully aware that the access which has been stated
to have been maintained by the Respondents as it stands today is not at all convenient for free
access to the public to the said beach. Once, it is not disputed that the public have right to free access
to the beach through the said property and the project of construction of hotel was approved with
the condition that such access is to be maintained, it is the duty of the Respondents to maintain a
proper access through the property to the beach. It has been stated across the bar and delineated in
a sketch produced by the Petitioners and not disputed by the Respondents that alternative access as
exists at present provided by the Respondents for the public is through the western half of the
property bearing old survey no. 787. It leads to the steps constructed near the retaining wall by the
side of the jetty leading to the sea situated on the said Vainguinim Beach. Once, it is clear that the
said access does not lead to the beach directly but to the steps and further to the rocks, it is
necessary to give appropriate directions to the Respondents to extend the said access upto the beach
along the retaining wall referred to in para 20 of the Affidavit-in-reply in Writ Petition No. 37/92 to
such an extent that the said access directly leads to the said beach and not to the rocks or some other
place. It is also necessary that such road should be maintained of 3 metres in width all throughout,
and also that the said road to be tarred and maintained in proper condition. The Respondents shall
also maintain proper area for parking of the cars and the area should be maintained in a usable
condition for the members of the public and the responsibility in that regard shall also be of the
Respondent Nos. 1 and 2. There shall not be any obstruction caused on the said access or car park
area either by construction of any fencing or any gate or otherwise and the same should be kept
open all 24 hours of day and night.

13. Considering the fact that neither of the parties have bothered to place on record a proper plan
with dimension and to scale, a further direction in that regard is necessary to the Respondent Nos. 1
and 2 who shall file a proper plan drawn by a recognized surveyor showing the location of the access
and car park maintained in accordance with directions of this Court and such plan should be filed
along with the Affidavit regarding the compliance of maintenance of such access within a period of
four weeks from today. The said access shall be at the location corresponding to the one disclosed in
the sketch produced by the Respondents and placed on record and marked at *X' for identification.
However, an alteration in the location of the access shall be made as regards the space near the gas
tank shown in the said sketch and sufficient space should be maintained from the location of the gas
tank so as to avoid hardship or injury to the members of the public using the said access and the
distance between the gas tank and the access shall not be less than 20 metres under any
circumstances. It shall also be the responsibility of the Respondent No.5 in Writ Petition No. 37/92
as well as other authorities to have periodical checks and to ensure the maintenance of the said
access and the car park area in the said property."

2. Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants argued that even though
the letter dated 1.8.1978 of the Chief Town Planner did not identify the location where footpath and
parking facilities were required to be provided by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for access to the beach,
but if the same is read in conjunction with permission granted by the Gram Panchayat vide letter
dated 22.8.1978 and letter dated 1.12.1978 of the Sarpanch, it becomes clear that respondent Nos. 1
and 2 were required to provide parking area, on the north- east corner of survey No. 787 adjacent to
survey No. 803 and public footpath was to be provided in a manner that it would run on survey No.
787 and form the boundary of survey No. 803 but they manipulated the so-called permission from
the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat and changed the location of public road and car parking. She
vehemently argued that access provided at the new site ends on the rocks and it is impossible for the
public to go to the beach even during the normal period what to say of high tide period and the High
Court committed grave error by declining the appellants' prayer for issue of mandamus to
respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to provide access to the beach through survey No. 787 in terms of the
approval accorded by the Chief Town Planner vide his letter dated 1.8.1978 read with the permission
granted by the Gram Panchyat on 22.8.1978. Shri Anil B. Divan, learned senior counsel appearing
for the respondents, submitted that the directions given by the High Court are just and proper and
do not call for interference, because public road, car parking and access to the beach had been
constructed in 1979 after obtaining permission from the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat and public
has been using the same for last almost 20 years. Learned senior counsel produced some
photographs to show that tarred road has been constructed and access provided through footpath
goes right up to the beach.

3. We have considered the respective submissions. Since it is not in dispute that respondent Nos. 1
and 2 have provided access to the beach at the alternative site in 1979 and the same is in existence
for last almost 20 years and is being used by the public, it is not possible to agree with Ms. Indira
Jaising that the High Court committed an error by not taking cognizance of the approval accorded
by the Chief Town Planner and the permission granted by the Gram Panchayat on 22.8.1978. It is
true that Sarpanch did not place before the Gram Panchayat letter dated 29.9.1979 written by
respondent No.1 for permission to change the location of the footpath and parking area from the site
originally sanctioned and the Gram Panchayat did not pass any resolution sanctioning such change,
but the fact remains that pursuant to letter dated 29.9.1979 written by the Sarpanch of the Gram
Panchayat, respondent No.1 laid access to the beach at alternative site and made it operational
sometime in 1979 and the same is being used by the public since then. The photographs produced
during the hearing of the appeal also prima facie show that access to the beach is available at the
alternative site. It is not the appellants’ pleaded case that they were unaware of the change of
location of public access to the beach and construction of road, parking area, etc. at the alternative
site in 1979. Therefore, the writ petition filed by them in 2000 was highly belated, and the High
Court may have been justified in non-suiting them only on the ground of delay. However, as the
High Court has dealt with the matter on merits, we do not consider it necessary to deal with this
issue in detail, more so because we are convinced that the directions given by the High Court to
respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for ensuring that public road is shifted from the site near 10,000 Kg.
poisonous gas tank and access to the beach ends on the beach and not on the rocks are just and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1238478/ 46Fomento Resorts & Hotels & Anr vs Minguel Martins & Ors on 20 January, 2009

proper and are in consonance with public interest.

4. In the result appeal is dismissed. Needless to say that if respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have not carried
out the directions given by the High Court in toto and access to the beach still ends at the rock or
there is any other deficiency in the implementation of the order impugned in this appeal, then the
appellants or any other interested person shall be free to bring this to the notice of the High Court
for appropriate order and action.

What is the nature and significance of the planning process for a

large Municipal town area? In that process, what is the role of the Municipal

Corporation, which is the statutory planning authority? Can the State

Government interfere in its decisions in that behalf and if so, to what extent?

Does the State Government have the power to issue instructions to the Municipal

Corporation to act in a particular manner’ contrary to the Development Pla

sanctioned by the State Government, and that too a number of years after the

Municipal Corporation having taken the necessary steps in consonance with the

plan? Can the State Government instruct a Municipal Corporation to shift the

reservation for a public amenity such as a primary school on a plot of land, and

also instruct it to grant a development permission for residential purpose

thereon without modifying the Development Plan? Could it still be considered as

an action following the due process of law’ merely because a provision

Development Control Rules is relied upon, whether it is applicable or not? Or

where the Municipal Corporation § is required to take such contrary steps,

supposedly on the instructions of the concerned Minister / Chief Minister, for the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 3Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

development of a property for the benefit of his relative, would such instructions

amount to interference/mala fide exercise of power? Is it permissible for {1

landowner and developer to defend the decision of the Government in thei

favour on the basis of a- provision in the erstwhile Town’ Planning — Scher

against the purpose for which the land is reserved under the presently prevalent

Development Plan? Is it permissible for the landowner and developer to explain

and justify such a favourable Government decision by relying upon the authority

of the Government under another section of the statute which is not ev

invoked by the Government? What inference is expected to be drawn in such a

situation with respect to the role played by the ministers or the muni

officers? What orders are expected to be passed when such facts are brought to

the notice of the High Court in a Public Interest Litigation? These are some of

the issues which arise in this group of Civil Appeals in the context

provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (for short

MRTP Act) concerning a property situated in Pune Municipal area.

Qe These appeals arise out of two- writ petitions in public i

leading to concurrent judgments and a common’ order dated 6th - 15th Marct

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 4Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

1999 passed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. These writ petitions

bearing nos.4433 and 4434 of 1998 were filed respectively by one Vijay Krishna

Kumbhar, a journalist and one Nitin Duttatraya Jagtap, a Municipal Corporator of

Pune. The petitions pointed out that a particular plot of land bearing Final Plot

No.110 (F.P. No. 110 for short), and admeasuring about 3450 sq. meters,

situated on Prabhat Road in the Erandwana area of the city, was initia

reserved for a public purpose namely, a garden/playground, and subsequently

for a primary school. They further pointed out that a number of years after the

Pune Municipal Corporation (hereinafter referred to as PMC) took all the

necessary steps to acquire’ this particular plot of land, the landowner ol

Laxmikant Madhav Murudkar appointed M/s Vyas Constructions, a proprietary

concern of one Shri Girish Vyas (the appellant in Civil Appeal  No.198-19

2000) as the developer of the property. Shri Girish Vyas is the son-in-law of Shri

Manohar Joshi who was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 14.03.1995 till

January 1999. The petitioners contended that only because of the instructions

from the Urban Development Department (UDD for short) which was under Shri

Manohar Joshi, that in spite of the reservation for a primary school, the plot was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 5Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

permitted to be developed for _ private residences flouting all norms and

mandatory legal provisions. They sought to challenge the building permission

which was issued by the PMC under the instructions of the State Government, by

submitting that these instructions amounted to interference into the lawful

exercise of the powers of the Municipal Corporation, and the same was m
fide. After hearing all concerned, the petitions were allowed, and an order has
been passed to cancel the Commencement (of construction) certificates, and

Occupation Certificate, and to pull down the concerned building which has been

constructed in the meanwhile. The State Government has been directed to

initiate criminal investigation against Shri Manohar Joshi, Shri Ravindra Murlidhar

Mane, the then Minister of State for UDD, and the then Pune Municipal

Commissioner Shri Ram Nath Jha.

3s Being aggrieved by this order, the present group of appeals have
been filed:
(i) Civil Appeal Nos. 198 - 199/. 2000 are filed by the developer’ Shr

Vyas and his proprietary concern M/s Vyas Constructions. Civil Appeal No. 2450

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 6Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

of 2000 is filed by the landowner Dr. Laxmikant Madhav  Murudkar (since

deceased) to challenge the judgments and the order in their’ entirety. 7

submissions by and large are similar.

(ii) Civil Appeal Nos. 2102-2103 of 2000 are filed by Shri Manohar Joshi, the

then Chief Minister, Civil Appeal Nos. 2105-2106 of 2000 are filed by Shri Ram

Nath Jha who was the then Pune Municipal Commissioner, and Civil Appeal No.

2120 of 2000 is filed by Shri Ravindra Murlidhar Mane, the then Minister of State,

UDD. These appeals seek to expunge the adverse remarks against the

appellants, and the order directing criminal investigation against them.

(iii) Civil Appeal Nos. 196-197 of 2000 are filed by Maruti Raghu Sawant and

others who were the tenants in this property. They contend that in the scheme

prepared by the developer, they were to become owners of their tenements

whereas under the original reservation, they were to be evicted.

We may note at this stage that though the PMC accepts _ the

judgment, it has no objection to the tenants continuing as tenants of PMC in the

building which is constructed for accommodating them on a portion of the very

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 7Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

plot of land. The tenants, however, contend that if the plot of land is taken over

by PMC, they will remain mere tenants as against the ownership rights which

were assured to them by the developer and the landlord, and are, there’

continuing to maintain their appeals.

4. All these appeals are opposed and the impugned judgment and

order are defended by the original petitioners as well as by the PMC and the

State Government. It is relevant to note that the State of Maharashtra as well as

PMC had opposed the writ petitions in the High Court, but they have not filed

any appeals and have now accepted the judgment and order as it is. Since, all

these appeals are arising out of the same judgment and order, they have been

heard and are being decided together, by treating the appeals filed by Shri Girish

Vyas as the lead appeals.

Facts leading to these appeals

Reservation on F.P. No. 110 for a garden

5. Dr. Laxmikant Madhav Murudkar (since deceased), appellant in Civil

Appeal No. 2450 of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as Landowner) owned the

property bearing F.P. No. 110. The Government of Maharashtra sanctioned a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 8Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Development Plan for Pune City by publishing a notification dated 7.7.1966 in the

official gazette dated 8.7.1966, which fixed 15.8.1966 as the date on which the

said plan shall come into force. (The said plan is hereinafter referred to as 1966

D.P. Plan). Under the said 1966 D.P. Plan, F.P. No. 110-112 were reserved for a

garden. The Plan was sanctioned in exercise of the power of the _ State

Government under Section 10 of the then prevalent Bombay Town Planning Act

1954 (1954 Act for short). This notification stated that the PMC had passed the

necessary resolution of its intention to prepare a Development Plan, carried out

the necessary survey, considered the suggestions received from the members of

the pubic under Section 9 of the Act, and after modifying the Plan wi

found necessary, submitted it to the Government, and thereafter the

Government having consulted the Director of Town Planning, had in exercise of

its power under Section 10 (1) and (2) of the Act, sanctioned the Development

Plan.

6. Subsequently, the 1954 Act was repealed and replaced by the

MRTP Act with effect from 11.01.1967. However, by virtue of Section 165 (2) of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 9Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011
MRTP Act, the 1966 D.P. Plan was saved. Consequently, when the landowner

applied for the sanction of a layout in F.P. No.110, the same was rejected by

PMC. Therefore, the landowner served on the State Government a notice dated

8th May 1979 under Section 49 (1) of the MRTP Act, calling upon it to purchase

the land and to “commence the proceedings for acquisition". The notice stated

that the F.P. No.110 was not acquired within the period of 10 years granted to

the Planning Authority to implement the D.P. (for the Pune Municipal area, PMC

is the Planning Authority). It further stated that as per his understanding, the

D.P. was under revision but the reservation on petitioner's F.P. No.110 had not

been changed, and ‘the reservation will never be cancelled and the final plot will

never be handed back' to him. The State Government confirmed the purchase

notice under Section 49 (4) of the Act by its letter dated 5.12.1979.

Government's letter informed the landowner that necessary instructions have

been issued to the PMC, and he may approach their office.

Steps for acquisition of F.P. No. 110

Te The standing committee of the PMC thereafter passed a resolution

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 10Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

on 5.1.1980 to initiate the proposal for acquisition. The PMC then forwarded the

proposal to the Collector of Pune on 9.5.1980 to take the steps for acquisition.

On 27.8.1981, the State Government notified the land for acquisition under

Section 126 of the MRTP~ Act read with Section 6 of the Land = Acquisit

1894 (for short L.A. Act). A Special Land Acquisition Officer (S.L.A.0. for short)

was appointed to perform the functions of the Collector. A notice informing the

initiation of the proceedings under the L.A. Act as required under Secti
thereof was issued on 8.9.1981 seeking claims for compensation. The
landowner replied to the notice, but did not challenge the acquisition. He filed

his claim statement during the acquisition proceeding, and demanded’ the
compensation at the rate of Rs. 480 per sq.m, and also that the~ mate

removed after demolition of the temporary = structures (of the tenants) on

property should be given to him. Twenty four tenants filed a common «

statement and objected to the acquisition, but did not seek any compensation.

They specifically stated that ‘there will not be any objection if they are provided

with alternative accommodation on the land to  be- acquired’. The S.L.A.0.

passed his award under Section 11 of the L.A. Act on 12.5.1983. He rejected the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 11Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

objections of the tenants, and awarded the compensation of Rs. 100 to each of

the 25 tenants. He determined the compensation payable to the landowner at

Rs. 6,10,823/-. On 15.3.1985 the landowner withdrew’ the amount of

compensation by furnishing necessary security, though under protest.

8. After the Award was made by the S.L.A.0. on 12.5.1983 as stated

earlier, a notice under Section 12 (2) of the L.A. Act was given, to
possession of the land-= on 20.5.1983. Once again, only the tenants’ obje
thereto. They filed a suit on 19.5.1983 in the Court of Civil Judge,

Division, Pune, bearing Suit No. 966 of 1983, to challenge the acquisition and the

Award. The landowner was joined therein as defendant’ No. 3s The = Cour

granted an interim injunction on 19.6.1983, restraining the authorities from

taking possession. However, after hearing the parties, an order was passed on

9.2.1984 vacating the injunction, and returning the plaint for failure to give the

mandatory notice required under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The

tenants filed an appeal to the District Court against that order, but the same was

also dismissed. Thereafter, the tenants made a representation to the the

Minister of State for UDD, pointing out their difficulties, which persuaded him to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 42Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

pass an administrative order restraining the authorities concerned from taki

possession of F.P. No. 110.

9. It is pertinent to note that all along, the landowner did

challenge the acquisition of his land in any manner whatsoever. On the other

hand, he sought a Reference under Section 18 of the L.A. Act for enhancement

of the compensation. The District Court dismissed that Reference bearing Ni

10

273 of 1983 by order dated 15.4.1988, but enhanced the solatium and additional

amount payable under Section 23(2) and 23(1A) of the L.A. Act. The amount

payable under the order of the District Court was collected by the landowner,

though under protest, but he did not prefer the appeal permissible under Section

54 of the L.A. Act.

Revision of the OD.P. Plan for Pune under the MRTP-~ Act and

change of utilisation of F.P. No. 110 to a Primary school

10. In the meanwhile, the process of revising the Development Plan of

Pune city under the provisions of MRTP Act was going on. The PMC a

planning authority had passed a resolution on 15.3.1976 declaring its intention to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 13Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

prepare a Revised Development Plan under Section 23 (1) read with Section 38

of the MRTP Act. The State Government appointed the Director of Town Planning

to be the Special Officer for that purpose under Section 162 (1) of 1

After observing all the legal formalities, the said Director published in the official

gazette on 18.9.1982 the Revised Draft Development Plan under Section 26 (1)

of the Act. In that plan F.P. No. 110-112 were initially reserved for children's

play-ground, but subsequently the reservation was changed to primary school.

After inviting the objections and _ suggestions, and after considering them,

State Government sanctioned the Revised D.P. Plan on 5.1.1987 (though with a

few modifications), to be effective from 1.1.1987 (hereafter referred as 1!

D.P. Plan for short) as also the Development Control Rules (D.C. Rules for short).

In the sanctioned D.P. Plan of 1987, the purpose of utilization of the

plots was, as stated above changed to primary school.

11

The modification with respect to these three plots was as follows: 
"Reservation continued. Development allowed as per note 4".

Note 4 reads as follows: 
"Sites designated for Primary Schools from Sector I
to VI as may be decided by the Pune Municipal
Corporation may be _-= allowed’ to be developed by

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 14Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

recognized public institutions registered under Public
Charitable Trust Act, working in that field or the owners of
the land."

Thus by virtue of this note, the purpose could also be effectuated either by the

owner of the land, or by a recognized charitable institution.

11. It is relevant to note at this stage that a school for the handicapped

children has come up in the adjoining F.P. No. 111. Besides, a primary school

was set up by Symbiosis International Cultural and Educational Centre

(*Symbiosis' for short) on F.P. No. 112. It is stated that Symbiosis and another

educational institution viz. Maharashtra Education Society (MES) had ~=sought

these plots since they were in need of land for extension of their educatio

activities. The then Chief Minister of Maharashtra had recommended the

proposal of MES by his letter dated 9.4.1986, and the society had applied to the

then Commissioner of Pune by its letter dated 29.4.1986. That was, however,

without any effect.

12. The S.L.A.0. gave one more notice to take possession of F.I

No.110 on 1.3.1988. It led to the filing of Regular Civil Suit bearing No. 397 of

1988 by some of the tenants in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Pune

against the State Government and PMC, once again challenging the award of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 15Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

12

S.L.A.0., and seeking an injunction to protect their possession. The Cou

granted the interim injunction as sought. Thereafter the landowner, who was

one of the defendants in the suit, applied for transposing himself as a plaintiff,

which prayer was allowed on 2.4.1988. The Court accepted the contention of

the tenants that the acquisition had lapsed due to the change of _ purpo

reservation from what it was in 1966 viz. a garden by the time the award was

made, and, therefore, decreed the suit by its order dated 23.4.1990.

13. The PMC preferred a first appeal against that decree to the Bombay

High Court on 7.1.1991, but the Additional Registrar of the High Court returned

the appeal by his order dated 21.4.1992 for presentation to the District Court on

the basis of the valuation of the suit, and the provision for jurisdiction as it then

existed. Accordingly, the PMC filed the appeal before the District Court

immediately on 29.4.1992, but the District Court in turn, by its order passed two

years later on 7.4.1994 returned the appeal for re-presenting it to the

Court, on the ground that the suit was valued above Rs. 50,000/- and as per the

rules then existing the appeal would lie to the High Court. PMC once again filed

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 16Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the appeal in the High Court being F.A (Stamp) No. 18615 of 1994 on 18.7.1994,

alongwith an Application for condonation of delay for the reasons as sta

above. This Appeal remained pending till it was withdrawn on the direction of

the State Government on 18.8.1998, in the circumstances which will be presently

pointed out. It is, however, relevant to note that this appeal was withdrawn at a

point of time when the two public interest petitions were filed on 12.8.1998, and

were pending in the High Court. The impugned order of the Division Bench on

13

these petitions has directed the PMC to move an _— Application before the

Court for reviving the First Appeal (Stamp No.18615 of 1994), and pursua

thereto the PMC has already moved the necessary Application on 13.1.2000. Be

that as it may.

Steps taken by the landowner after Shri Manohar Joshi

took over as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra

14. It is material to note that after the decision of the Reference Court,

the landowner entered into an agreement of sale of the concerned land with one

Shri Mukesh Jain on 17.8.1989, though no steps were taken thereafter by either

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 17Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

of the parties on the basis of that agreement. It so happened that consequent

upon the elections to the State Assembly, a new Government came in power in

the State of Maharashtra in March 1995, and Shri Manohar Joshi took over as the

Chief Minister (hereinafter referred as the then Chief Minister). He retained with

himself the UDD portfolio. The earlier referred Shri Ravindra Mane became the

Minister of State for UDD (hereinafter referred to as the then Minister of State).

On 20.10.1995 the landowner entered into a Development agreement with M/s

Vyas Constructions by virtue of which the landowner handed over all rights of

development in the property to them for a consideration of Rs. 1.25 crores, a flat

of 1500 sq. feet area and an office space of 500 sq. feet in the building to be

developed on F.P. No. 110. The agreement stated that it was being entered into

to solve the practical difficulties. Para 7 thereof stated that the developer shall

follow the procedure or process of de-reservation of the said property. Para 20

and 21 stated that ‘after de-reservation of the property, the developer agrees to

14

get the clearance under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976 which

may be necessary,' and for that purpose he was authorised to get any scheme

sanctioned. M/s Vyas Constructions is stated to have settled the claim of above

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 18Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

referred Shri Mukesh Jain. On the same day, the Landowner executed an

irrevocable Power of Attorney in favour of Shri Girish Vyas for the development

of F.P No. 110. (He is referred hereinafter as the developer). The landowner

simultaneously executed another Power of Attorney in favour of one Shri Shriram

Karandikar on 26.10.1995, authorising him to take necessary steps concerning

the development of that land.

15; Thereafter, on 1.11.1995 the architect of the landowner submitted

to PMC a building layout for permission for residential use of F.P. No. 110. The

City Engineer of PMC rejected the proposal by his reply dated 6.11.1995 under

Section 45 of the MRTP~ Act read with Section 255 of the Bombay’ Provi

Municipal Corporations Act 1949 (BPMC Act for short) and D.C. Rule No. 6.7.1,

since the plot had _ been reserved for a primary school, and hence such

permission could not be granted. It was however pointed out in this reply of the

City Engineer that the development of the land was permissible in the manner

indicated in the note No.4 published in the gazette which has been referred to

hereinabove (i.e. putting up a primary school either by the landowner or by a

charitable trust).

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 19Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

16. At this stage, landowner's Attorney holder, Shri Shriram Karandikar

wrote to the Minister of State for UDD on 20.11.1995 seeking a direction to the

Municipal Commissioner to sanction landowner's aforesaid application dated

15

1.11.1995 for development of the property for residential houses. He relied on

the decree of Civil Judge Senior Division in Civil Suit No.399 of 1998 and prayed

for correcting the Development Plan also. From here onwards starts the role of

the then Minister of State, the Municipal Commissioner, and the then Chie

Minister.

Processing of the application dated 20.11.1995 on behalf of the

landowner at the level of the State Government

17s In their petitions to the High Court, the writ petitioners made the

allegation of mala fides on the part of the then Chief Minister and the Minister of

State for UDD in entertaining the application made on behalf of the landowner.

It, therefore, became necessary for the Division Bench of the High Court to call

for the original record from the State Government as well as from the PMC. The

application dated 20.11.1995 made by Shri Karandikar on behalf of the landlord

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 20Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

narrated the developments until the date of that application including’ the

judgment and decree of the Civil Court setting aside the acquisition of

property. It was, thereafter, submitted that the Municipal Commissioner be

directed to sanction the development permission as per the application of the

architect of the landowner. It is relevant to note that as far as this application of

Shri Karandikar is concerned, it was not addressed to the State Government or to

the Secretary of the concerned Department, but directly to the Minister of State

for  UDD, which fact is noted by the Division Bench in _ its judgment.

application did not bear any inward stamp of  UDD. In the margin of

application, there was a noting by the Private Secretary of the Minister of State

16

for UDD, recording that the Minister had directed the Deputy Secretary, UDD, to

call a meeting on 19.1.1996. The record further shows that although the Under

Secretary of UDD Shri P.V. Ghadge accordingly called the initial meeting,

addressing a letter to the Director, Town’ Planning and the Municipal

Commissioner, the same was adjourned to 22.1.1996. On that date, the meeting

was attended by the Director of Town Planning, the Deputy City Engineer

PMC, Deputy Director of Town Planning, Pune, as well as by Shri Karandikar and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 21Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

his advocate, but what happened in that meeting is not reflected in this file.

Initial Stand of Urban Development Department and PMC

18. The Under’ Secretary (Shri P.V. Ghadge) prepared a prelimina

note dated 2.2.1996 for the subsequent meeting. At the outset, the note

mentions in a nutshell the background for the meeting which was _— sought

behalf of the landlord. Thereafter it gives the initial opinion of the

Department at the end of the note, which is as follows: 
"In this regard it is the advice of the department that
acquisition has been done after taking action on _ the - purchase
notice. The compensation amount has been accepted. Even if
the reservation of the plot is changed, it does not make any
difference. Directions be given to the Pune Municipal Corporation
to immediately present this matter in the Bombay High Court.

The question of returning the plot to the land owner’ does not
arise."

19. On the background of this departmental note containing its advice,

a meeting was held on 3.2.1996 presided over by the Minister of State for UDD,

and the minutes of the meeting are part of the record placed before the High

Court. Apart from Shri Karandikar and his advocate, high ranking officers such

17

as (i) Secretary, UDD, (ii) Director, Town Planning, (iii) Commissioner, PMC, (iv)

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 22Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

City Engineer, PMC and (v) Under Secretary, UDD were present in the meeting.

The minutes of the meeting are recorded by the Under Secretary.

20. These minutes record that in this meeting the advocate

applicant explained the facts leading to his client's application, justifying as

why the reservation on the land may  be_- deleted. He referred to

proceedings, the fact that 25-30 tenants were residing on the property for many

years, and that on the adjoining property a school was running. He therefore

submitted that the reservation on the land be deleted.

21. The note records a preliminary query raised by the Secretary, UDD

as to whether the advocate was pleading on behalf of the tenants

landowner, to which the Advocate replied that he was pleading for

landowner. The Secretary, UDD raised two more queries viz. (i) if the land was

not useful for reservation because of the tenants, then how will it be available to

the landowner, and (ii) whether the Landowner had ever objected to

reservation, to which the advocate replied in the negative.

22. The City Engineer, PMC pointed out during the meeting

consequent upon the property owner issuing the purchase notice, the PMC had

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 23

of

to

the

or

the

this

thatGirish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

acquired the land, the award was made, the property owner had accepted the

compensation, and that he never objected to the change in reservation due to

the revision of the D.P. Plan during the entire period of revision i.e. 1982-87.

With respect to the proceedings initiated by the tenants, he pointed that PMC

18

had filed an Appeal in the Bombay High Court against the judgment of the Civil

Court, and the matter was sub-judice. He specifically asked whether the hearing

given to the applicant was on an appeal under Section 47 of the MRTP Act, or

was it on his application. He pointed out that the property was unde

reservation, and it could not be de-reserved in an appeal under Section 47. It

required an action in the nature of modification under Section 37 of the MRTP

Act. If it was an appeal, then it may be rejected, and if it was an application for

modification then a decision cannot be taken as the matter was sub-judice. On

these queries it was stated on behalf of the landowner that his application was a

request and not an appeal.

Directions by Minister of State and report made by the Municipal

Commissioner in pursuance thereof

23. It was thereafter pointed out on behalf of landowner that on the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 24Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

adjoining two plots, schools had been developed, and the Corporation may not

need this land. The note records that in view of this submission, the Minister of

State, UDD asked the Municipal Commissioner to examine whether the PMC

really needed the concerned property. He also suggested that it be examined, if

PMC can keep some portion of the land under reservation, and release t

remaining to the landowner. If such a compromise is to be arrived at, then the

property owner will have to accommodate the tenants on a portion of property

released to him. If PMC did not have any objection to reduce the area under

reservation, Government will issue the necessary direction to take action under

Section 87x The note records at that stage, that the Municipal Commissione

pointed out that the permission of the Municipal Corporation (meaning the

19

general body) was necessary to either delete the reservation, or to reduce the

area under reservation.

24. The file shows that accordingly the Under Secretary wrote to the

Municipal Commissioner on 14.2.1996 requesting him to examine the possibility

regarding any settlement after a site inspection, and to forward his opinion. He

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 25Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

was also asked to inform as to when had the PMC filed its appeal in the Bombay

High Court, and about its status.

25. The file shows that at this stage, the landowner changed his stand.

Shri Karandikar wrote another letter dated 23.3.1996 to the Minister of State that

his application be treated as an appeal under Section 47 of the MRTP Act.

26. The Municipal Commissioner replied Government's letter dated

14.2.1996 by his letter dated 17.4.1996. He pointed out that the development

permission for this particular plot had been rejected because the property was

under reservation. Then he reiterated the position of PMC as stated in

meeting of 3.2.1996. Then he added 
"On 3.2.1996 we took the same stand which was taken by
us in various counts and administrative levels regarding dispute
for the development of _ property, and that if any change’ is
proposed in the use of the said property, permission has to be
taken from the Pune Municipal Corporation. The Hon'ble Minister
of State for urban development ordered us to survey the subject
property and also ordered to explore the options of changing or
reducing the area of the reservation."

27. The Municipal Commissioner then stated that before considering

the various options as directed by the State Government, it was necessary to

20

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 26Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011
note the background of the subject property; viz. that as per the 1966 D.P. Plan,

it was reserved for a garden, and subsequently the reservation was changed to a

Primary School in the draft D.P. Plan of 1982 confirmed in 1987. He referred to

the litigation initiated by the tenants, the fact that the PMC had filed an appeal to

the High Court against the decision in the Civil Suit No. 397/1988, and that the

High Court sent back the matter to the District Court and it was pending there.

He placed on record the fact that though full price of the land was paid to the

owner, procedure of taking actual possession by the PMC was still pending for

last 13 years, because of which it was not possible to make appropriate use of

the land. The Minister had asked him to survey the subject property, and to

explore the possibility of changing or _ reducing the area of reservation.

commissioner pointed out that a survey was carried accordingly. He recorded

that on inspection following facts were mainly noted: 
"lL, There are about 36 temporary Houses on the land.
Be Out of the total area nearly half is encumbered.
Sua Two Educational Institutions in the vicinity of the
School.
4. There are 11 Educational Institutions in the vicinity
of the School.
5. Except the temporary Houses on this property the

development of the area is planned and corporation
has control over it."

The Commissioner however, did not specify as to which area of the’ city

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 27Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

considered by him when he spoke about ‘vicinity’ in item No. 4 above.

28. The land was to be developed either by PMC or the owner or by a

Charitable Trust as per the OD.P. Note 4 referred to above. The Munic

Commissioner then gave his opinion that development of a primary school on

21

that plot by a charitable institution appeared impossible due to various factors

such as the order of the Civil Court, litigation concerning this plot,

requirement of rehabilitation of the tenants on that plot, and existence of near
by schools. Besides, the area being a higher middle class area, the response to

a municipal school was doubtful. He then added as follows - ‘considering the
funds available, the PMC is inclined to develop’ school on some other p
reserved for school’. As we have noted earlier two well-known educationa

institutions, viz. MES and Symbiosis had already sought this plot also. The PMC

had however replied to them that it was not possible for it to give them this plot,

since it was not in the possession of PMC. The Municipal Commissioner failed to

bring these very relevant facts to the notice of the Government. Having noticed

these facts, the Division Bench has observed in para 143 of its judgment that the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 28Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Commissioner's statement in this behalf in his report was "far from truth".

29. The Commissioner then recorded that in view of the direction

the State Government to suggest alternatives for settlement, he had in tl

meanwhile, held discussions with Shri Karandikar, and that Shri Karandikar had

expressed readiness to give alternate unencumbered land within suburbs of Pune

admeasuring 5000 to 10000 sq. feet free of cost. Thereafter, in view of the

direction of the State Government and_ proposals from Shri Karandikar, the

Commissioner recorded two suggestions: 
"lL, Presently reserved area is about 3541 sq.mtrs out of
which nearly 50% area is occupied by occupants and remaining
area is open. The land owner after excluding the area occupied

by the existing houses, to transfer the remaining area to the Pune
Municipal Corporation for school. However, since the land owner

22

has accepted compensation for the entire area, for the area to be
transferred, he should refund the amount to the Pune Municipal

Corporation at the rate suggested by the Director of Town
Planning.

23 To get transferred land admeasuring 3000 sq.mtrs

elsewhere” at a convenient place in Pune City with school
admeasuring 500 sq.mtrs constructed thereon free of cost as per

specifications of the Pune Municipal Corporation, and for that
purpose it is necessary to get executed a proper agreement. But

land to be given elsewhere should not be- reserved’ in
development plan for school or some other purpose."

Thereafter his letter stated as follow: 
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 29Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

“If first proposal is to be accepted for developing school on
remaining area question regarding decision of Civil Judge, Senior
Division would arise. In this situation it is necessary to have the
support of the land owner’ and_ tenants for this proposal. For
implementing both the aforesaid proposals suggested by us it
would be appropriate if the following things are complied with: 
1. The Pune Municipal Corporation administration to take
permission from the Pune Municipal Corporation before releasing
rights in respect of the subject property.

2 For deleting reservation on the property taking action
under Section 37 of M.R.T.P.

3) For acquiring new site as per Proposal No.2 permission of
concerned Departments of the Pune Municipal Corporation will
have to be taken.

Then the Commissioner added: 
Prior to this since no such settlement matters have taken place

regarding the development plan of Pune Municipal Corporation,

the experience of Pune Municipal Corporation in this regard is
limited. Till the next order is received from the State Government

the Pune Municipal Corporation is continuing the judicial
procedure in respect of this land."

30. After the receipt of the letter dated 17.4.1996 from the Municipal

Commissioner, the file shows the following noting dated 24.4.1996:
a Mantralaya, Bombay 400 032

23

Date 24/4/1996

According to the instructions of Shri Chavan, Private Secretary
of the Hon'ble Chief Minister, please forward a copy of the report of
the Pune Municipal Corporation in the matter of Shri Karandikar for

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 30Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011
the perusal of the Hon'ble Chief Minister.

Shri Ghadesaheb Sd/Under Secretary Private Secretary
N.V. Minister of State for Finance,

Planning and Urban Development

Government of Maharashtra"

31. On receiving the above reply dated 17.4.1996 from Municipal

Commissioner, Shri Ghadge, the Under Secretary once again put up a detailed

note thereon. In first 8 paragraphs of that note he recorded the pre

developments, including and upto the letter sent by the Municipal Commissioner.

Thereafter in paragraph 9, 10 and 11 he put up the proposal of the department: 
"9, Considering the entire aforesaid circumstances, it is
firstly pointed out that applicant Shri Karandikar has approached
the Government on behalf of the land owner but the land owner
has already taken the price of the said property in the year 1983.
Though the physical possession of the said property is not
received to the Municipal Corporation still however, legally
Municipal Corporation has become owner’ of the said property.
Therefore, the Land Owner does not have any right to demand

return of the said property by deleting reservation. Now
considering the tenants, they have approached the Court’ and
therefore, it is not necessary to consider that aspect till the
matter is decided by the Court. If the said matter is decided

against the Municipal Corporation still the said persons shall be
tenants and the land owner shall be Municipal Corporation and
further that the tenants have requested for allotment of the land
for developing it.

10. Still however considering the fact that no way out
will be available if the matter is kept pending as it is, and further
considering that there are numerous schools in the vicinity of the
said property, there should be no objection’ to consider and
approve on government level the alternative No.1 suggested by

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 31Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011
24

the Municipal Commissioner. However, for the said purpose the
tenants will have to withdraw their proceedings from the Court
and they will have to pay to the Municipal Corporation the cost
price of the 50% portion to be released for the said tenants as
may be determined by the Director, Town Planning. If the said
alternative is acceptable to the land owner, the Pune Municipal
Corporation be informed about the orders of the Government to
initiate proceedings u/s 37 for the purposes of deletion of 50%
property from reservation and to forward the said proposal to the
Government.

11. Second alternative does not deserve any
consideration since for shifting the reservation the alternative
property should have the same area like that of the original one
and that it is necessary that such property should be in the
vicinity of approximately 200 omtrs. from the property under
reservation. So also the matters like approach road and level of
the land are also required to be similar. (MARGINAL REMARK Rule No.13.5 of Pune Development Control Rules).

12. Proposal in paragraph 10 submitted for approval."

The note was countersigned by Shri Deshpande, Deputy Secretary,

Town Planning on 4.6.1996, and by the Senior Chief Secretary (NV i.e. Nagar

Vikas or Urban Development). Thus the Urban Development Department did

not accept the second proposal of the Municipal Commissioner to remove the

reservation on the plot in its entirety, but recommended the acceptance of the

first proposal to reduce the reservation on the plot to 50% of its a

Minister for State however did not sign the note and he _- ordered a_ fu

discussion on the subject on 12.6.1996.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 32Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

32. Thus there was once again a discussion with the Minister of State,

UDD on 12.6.1996 when Shri Karandikar, Shri Harihar, City Engineer, PMC, Shri

Deshpande, Deputy Secretary, Town Planning and Shri Ghadge, Under Secretary

were present. Shri Ghadge made a note of the meeting and signed it

25

13.6.1996, and which note is also signed by Shri Deshpande and the Additional

Chief Secretary. The note records that on behalf of the applicants it was stated

that it was not possible for them to accept the alternative no.1, and Municipal

Corporation should consider the second alternative. The note further recor

that thereupon the City Engineer suggested that if the applicant shows Sl

other alternative properties, the Municipal Corporation will inspect all of

and then consider as to which of them is possible to be accepted. The note

thereafter records as follows: 
"In the event such alternative property’ is selected by
Municipal Corporation, then action to be taken for shifting the
reservation from the subject property as per Rule No. 13.5 of
Pune Development Control Rules can be considered. However, it
was clarified by the Department that for that purpose’ the

condition of 200. mtr. Distance will have to be relaxed and for
which the permission of Hon. Chief Minister will have to be
obtained".

The PMC was thereafter asked to submit its response in the light of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 33Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

above discussion. Shri Ghadge recorded this suggestion in his letter date

20.6.1996 addressed to the Municipal Commissioner.

33. The Municipal Commissioner then wrote back to the Under

Secretary, UDD by his letter dated 15.7.1996, pointing out that the applicant had

shown four sites from which one at  Lohegaon Survey No.261 4H.No.1/2

admeasuring 3000 sq.meter was suitable for a primary school, but it was in the

Agricultural zone as per the approved D.P., and if it was to be conve

Residential zone, the approval of the State Government will have to be obtained

for such a modification.

26

34. On receiving this letter from the Municipal Commissioner, Shr

Ghadge once again put up a detailed note and at the end of para 8

stated as follows: 
"Considering the above circumstances and especially “A" on 12 T.V.
and B on 14 T.V., there could be no objection in granting permission
for shifting reservation under Rule 13.5 of the D.C. Rules by relaxing
the 200 meter condition and accordingly directions can be given to the
PMC for taking the following necessary action: 
1. The Pune Municipal Corporation should recover the amount of
compensation paid earlier, for acquisition of final plot No.110 = at
Earndwane together with the structures, with simple interest.

2. The State Government should issue directions to the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 34Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Pune Municipal Corporation for getting the plot at  Lohegaon, Pune
Survey No.261 Hissa No.1/2 from Agricultural zone into residential
zone by following the procedure under Section 37(1) of the
Maharastra Regional and Town’ Planning Act, 1966 and thereafter
submitting the proposal to the State Government for sanction.

3 The Commissioner Pune Municipal Corporation should
take action for shifting the reservation for Primary School on Final Plot
No.110 in the Development Plan of Pune City under Rule 13.5 of the
Development Control Rules, Pune to Lohegaon, Survey No.261, Hissa
No.1/2 and for that purpose the permission of the Corporation is not
necessary as intimated earlier by the State Government in another
case [Survey No.39/1, Kothrud, Pune].

4. After complying with (1) and (3) above, the Pune
Municipal Corporation should enter into an Agreement for transfer of
the land at  Lohegaon Pune and_ thereafter give development
permission for the plot at Erandwane. However the Completion
Certificate for that place should not be issued unless the construction
of School at Lohegaon is completed."

Commissioner containing exactly the above four conditions. The letter = state

that he had been ordered by the State Government to inform those four

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 37Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Corporation to act as per the above State Government directive and
submit report regarding compliance to the Government.

29

Yours faithfully,

Sd/Vidyadhar Deshpande
Deputy Secretary"

Notings from the Municipal Files: 
36. Thereafter we have the notings from the Municipal files which show

that consequently the City Engineer has written to landowner on 27.9.1996 to

return the amount paid to him for acquisition of final Plot No.110 T.P. Scheme,

No.1 with interest at the rate of 12%, and secondly to transfer concerned land

bearing survey No.261 Hissa No.1/2 at Lohegaon free of cost and without any

encumbrances. The letter further stated that only after compliance of the above

two conditions he will be given permission for development of F.P. No.110. It

then stated that building completion certificate will be given only after

procedure under’ Section 37 (1) of the MRTP~ Act for deleting Survey No.

Hissa 2/1 at Lohegaon, Hadapsar from the agricultural zone, and reserving it for

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 38Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

primary school is completed, and sanctioned by the State Government.

37. Thereafter there is one more note of the Municipal Commissioner

dated 21.9.1996 which records the opinion of the Senior Law Officer that the

permission of the general body of PMC will be required for entering in

agreement for deleting the reservation of plot at Erandawana. With respect to

the same the commissioner has recorded as follows: 
"However, since the State Government has given clear
orders to take action under Rule 13.5 of the Development Control
Rules of Pune for complying with the subject matters and since

30

directives have been given for making such _ change, no
permission of the Pune Municipal Corporation is necessary".

Subsequent Developments

38. Consequently, the subsequent steps have been taken. The

landowner has returned the amount as sought, a deed of settlement has been

entered into between the Landowner and the PMC, and Commencement

Certificates have been issued on 28.11.1996 and 3.5.1997 for the two buildings

proposed to be constructed. An Occupation Certificate dated 20.12.1997 was

also given for a part of the building completed thereafter namely, BW:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 39Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

containing 24 flats for the tenants. It is however interesting to note that PMC

instructed its counsel on 19.11.1996 to withdraw its first appeal in the

Court as directed by the Government even before the landowner returning the

amount of compensation with interest on 22.11.1996.

39. It has so transpired that though the land at Lohegaon was handed

over to PMC as proposed, subsequently the Municipal Corporation found that

there was not so much need of a school at Lohegaon, but a school was needed

at Sinhagad Road, Dattawadi. The procedure for changing the zone of the land

at Lohegaon as required under Section 37 of the MRTP Act was also taking its

own time at the municipal level. Once again there’ was a correspondence

between the PMC and the Government in this behalf. The Commissioner wrote

to the Dy. Secretary, UDD on 28.5.1998 for a modification in the conditions in

the Government letter dated 3.9.1996 to get the school constructed = at

Dattawadi (instead of Lohegaon) in lieu of the school reservation on plot no. 110

31

at Prabhat road. At this stage for the first time we have the letter

developer dated 15.7.1998 addressed to the City Engineer of PMC signed by Shri

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 40Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Girish Vyas for the Vyas Constructions, stating that he was prepared to offer an

alternative site admeasuring 3000 sq. meters at  Mundhwa within PMC area

which is in residential zone. This was to avoid the difficulty concernin

change of zone. Additionally he was prepared to deposit an amount with PMC

equivalent to the cost of construction of 500 sq. meters as per PMC's standard

specifications, and PMC may construct the school whenever and wherever’ it

required. He further sought that on his doing so, the final completion certificate

be issued so that the flat purchasers can occupy their flats in the building on F.P.

No.110 which was almost ready.

40. The Government file contains one more note made by the Under

Secretary Shri Rajan Kop and signed by Shri Deshpande on 22.7.1998. It

clearly recorded below the note that it was marked for the Additional (

Secretary to the Chief Minister, and also for the Chief Minister. The

mentions that there has been substantial criticism in local newspaper about this

matter. It is stated that the issue was raised in the general body of PMC, and it

was represented that an amenity in the area is being destroyed by deleting the

reservation for a primary school. The Commissioner had defended the decision

by contending that although 3450 sq. meter area of reservation of F.P. No.110

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 41Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

was being deleted, reservation on 8219 sq. meters on adjoining two plots was

being maintained. It was also pointed out by the Commissioner that an

additional amenity was being created in another area. The note further records

32

that in the meanwhile the - proposal to shift the reservation on  the_ plo

Lohegaon had been filed (i.e. disapproved) by the Standing Committee of PMC.

Last para of this note states as follows: 
"Senior Chief Secretary of Hon. Chief Minister has issued
instructions to put up a self explanatory note in this entire matter

for perusal of Hon. Chief Minister. It is further instructed to
include the matters wherein the Government has taken a decision
in this matter as also in another matter prior thereto, the

information provided and points suggested by Municipal

Corporation with respect to the matters of deletion of reservation

from Pune City Development Plan, etc., Such note containing the

full background, factual and other aspects of the matter would be

useful for Hon. Chief Minister if certain questions are raised with

respect to the said matter in the current session of Legislative
Assembly."

41. On receiving the developer's letter dated 15.7.1998, the

Commissioner once again wrote to Under Secretary UDD on 23.7.1998

suggesting acceptance of the two proposals of the developer, but seeking orders

of the government therefor. It is material to note at this stage tha

Government file there is a clear noting of the Principal Secretary UDD

24.7.1998 that the application of Rule 13.5 in the matter under question was not

legal. As the note states: 
Me eo evra With due respect to the persons’ then, doing
interpretation of the said decision of the Government and Rule
No. 13.5, I feel that application of Rule No. 13.5 in the matter
under question is not legal. Upon plain reading of the said rule it
is clear that this rule can be applied when the reservation is to be

shifted within a distance of 200 mtrs. Government or the
Commissioner do not appear to be empowered for such shifting
beyond the distance of 200 mtrs. It would have been much

appropriate that the action for change as contemplated in Sec. 37
of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 would
have been taken...... "

33

42. In view of Commissioner's letter dated 23.7.1998 however, onc

again a departmental note was prepared containing following opinion, still

seeking to resort to Rule 13.5.

" grpevesiens After considering this issue the following opinion is
being expressed on the proposal of Pune Municipal Corporation.

(1) Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation to take action’ to
cancel the action earlier taken of shifting reservation at Lohegaon
as per Rule No. 13.5 and the action of shifting the said part
reservation to Mundhawa be initiated afresh under Rule 13.5.

(2) Prior to taking action as stated in (1) above, even though it is
stated by the Commissioner that the land at Mundhwa admeasuring
3000 sq. mtrs., suggested by the Promoter is suitable, still however,
it is necessary that the Commissioner , Pune Municipal Corporation
should get himself satisfied about the 12 mtr. wide approach being
available to the said land. After satisfying itself the legal action for
taking the said Mundhwa land in possession of the Pune Municipal
Corporation be completed. After completing these actions only, it is
necessary to take action as stipulated in (1) above.

(3) As per the earlier instructions, the Pune Municipal Corporation
got executed agreement for construction of 500 sq.mtrs. Since the
action with respect to Lohegaon land had remained incomplete, the
Municipal Corporation could not grant permission to construct school

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 4343.

Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

therein. This construction could have been got done on = Mundhwa
land. However, from the letter of the Commissioner, Pune Municipal

Corporation it is seen that he has not yet decided as to whether the

school is to be constructed on the said land or not. On the other hand

he has asserted that since the Promoter is ready to pay such amount

of construction no loss would be caused to Municipal Corporation by

getting deposited such amount. Considering this issue, principally
there appears to be no objection on the part of the Commissioner in

accepting the proposal of promoter as recommended by him with a

view to get available the necessary amenity for the school as per their
requirements. However, it would be binding upon the Commissioner

to spend the said amount for the construction’ at such place which
may be found necessary and as =may_ be recommended by the
Education Committee.

(4) Since the actions to be taken as stipulated in point No. (3) above,

are between the Pune Municipal Corporation Education Committee and

Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation, there is no reason to
suspend the action of granting completion certification to the Promoter
therefore. Therefore, the Government shall have no objection if the

completion certificate is granted by Municipal Corporation to the

34

Promoter after completing the actions as stipulated in para No. 1 and
2 subject to the rules and provisions in that behalf.

If the aforesaid issues are approved, the proposal of the
Commissioner in the _ present circumstances being FOR superior
purpose than these contained in the earlier directives of the
Government there should be no reason to object the proposal
submitted by the Commissioner and the same ought to be principally
approval subject however, to the conditions mentioned in the
aforesaid discussion. In accordance hereof the draft or letter to be
sent to Pune Municipal Corporation is put up at Page No. /PV.

The above proposal will be issued on the same being approved.
Submitted for orders.

Below this note however, the Additional Chief Secretary to t

Chief Minister put up a remark as follows and signed below it: 
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 4444.

the

Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

"In this matter the developer and Hon. Chief Minister being
related, it is requested that the Hon. Minister of State should take
proper decision as per rules".

Thereafter there is the order of the Minister of State which is as follows: 
‘Proposal of Department approved. Orders be issued’: 
"Sd/=

28.7.98
N.V.V."

The Deputy Secretary thereafter sent a reply dated 29.7.1998 to

letters of the Municipal Commissioner dated 28.5.1998 and 23.7.1998. I

para 1 thereof he referred to the Commissioner's letter dated 28.5.1998 seeking

to shift reservation on F.P. No. 110 under DC Rule 13.5 to Mundhawa instead of

Lohegaon. Thereafter he stated in para 2 as follows: 
35

Fie YORE Now the Developer has shown his readiness to
make available land at Mundhawa. Therefore, in your letter you

have sought approval to recover the proper amount required for

the construction of 500 sq.mtrs, after taking action stated in
preceding paragraph. Upon due consideration of your request, I

have orders to inform you that after recovering such proper
amount from the Developer, the said amount be utilized for
construction of primary school at such place as may be required

and recommended by the Education Committee of Pune

Municipal Corporation. Because of this order request made by
you in your letter dt. 28.5.98 automatically becomes redundant.

In your letter dt. 23rd July 98 you have sought guidance on
the issue of grant of occupancy certificate to the Developer
After taking the action as stated in paragraph 1 and 2, there is no
reason for the Government to have objection if in furtherance
thereof the Pune Municipal Corporation issues the occupancy

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 45Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

certificate subject to the other’ provisions of the Rules in that
behalf."

45. In view of the directions dated 3.9.1996 issued by the St

Government, the PMC issued (i) Commencement Certificate (C.C. for short) in

the name of the landowner dated 28.11.1996 for constructing a building t

rehabilitate the tenants, (ii) the second C.C. dated 3.5.1997 for constructing the

other residential buildings consisting of ground’ plus ten _ floors (named sas

Sundew Apartment by the developer), and (iii) the Occupation Certificate (0.C.

for short) in part dated 20.12.1997 for the  tenants' building. Thereafte

developer signed a confirming agreement with the landowner and = his family

members on 16.1.1998 to once again confirm the terms of the earlier referred

development agreement entered into between the developer and landowner on

20.10.1995. It is at this stage, that two petitions bearing no. 4433/1998 and

4434/1998 were filed on 12.8.1998 and 14.8.1998 respectively. A Division Bench

first issued Rule Nisi without any interim order. In as much as the construction

36

had started from March 1997 and was substantially completed, only a direction

was given in Writ Petition No.4434/1998 not to create any third party interest.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 46Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

The PMC was already directed not to grant completion certificate in respect of

the ten storey building. Subsequently, the petitions were heard finally, and the

Division Bench consisting of Hon'ble Justice’ B.N. Srikrishna and Justice S

Parkar, rendered two concurrent judgments on 6th-15th March 1999, and a

common order which have been challenged in the present group of appeals.

Justification of the shifting of reservation under D.C. Rule 13.5:

Is it in consonance with the statute?

46. As we have noted, the State Government directed the PMC to shift

the reservation on FP, No. 110 under DC Rule 13.5. The question there’

comes up as to whether’ the action by the State is in consonance’ with

statutory scheme, and that apart whether such an action is permissible under DC

Rule 13.5? If we look to the scheme of the Act it gives importance

implementation of the sanctioned plan as it is and it is only in cer

contingencies that the provision thereunder is permitted to be modified, and that

too after following the necessary procedure made in that behalf.

Signification of the Sanctioned Plan and the provisions for the

modification thereof

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 47Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

47. The Planning’ process under the MRTP- Act’ is quite an_- elabo

process. A number of town planners, architects and officers of the Pla

Authority, and wherever necessary those of the State Government participate in

the process. They take into consideration the requirements of the citizens and

37

the need for the public amenities. The planners consider the difficulties presently

faced by the citizens, make rough estimate of the likely growth of the city in near

future and provide for their solutions. The plan is expected to be implemented

during the course of the next twenty years. After the draft Development Plan is

prepared, a notice is published in the official gazette stating that the

prepared. Under Section 26(1) of the Act the name and-= place where’ co
thereof will be available for inspection to the public at large is notified. Copies

and extracts thereof are also made available for sale. Thereafter suggestions

and objections are _ invited. The provisions’ of regional plan are given

weightage under Section 27 of the Act and then the plan is _ finalised

following the detailed process under Section 28 of the = Act. This being

position, Chapter-III of the MRTP~ Act on Development Plans requires the

sanctioned plan to be implemented’ as it is. There are only two metho

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 48Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

which modifications of the final Development Plan can be brought about. One is

where the proposal is such that it will not change the character of +

Development Plan, which is known as minor modification and for which the

procedure is laid down under Section 37 of the = Act. The other is wi

modification is of a substantial nature which is defined under Section 22A of the

Act. In that case the procedure as laid down under Section 29 is required to be

followed. There is also one more = analogous’ provision though it is_ slig

different i.e. the one provided under Section 50 of the Act, for deletion of the

reservation where the appropriate authority (other than the planning authority)

38

no longer requires the designated land for the particular public purpose,

seeks deletion of the reservation thereon.

48. The Government's action to shift the reservation on F.P. No. 110 is

under DC Rule 13.5 and not under Section 37 of the MRTP_ Act. We rf

therefore refer to DC Rule 13.5 and Section 37.

DC Rule 13.5 reads as follows: 
"13.5 If the land proposed to be laid out is affected by any
reservation/s or public purpose/s authority may agree to adjust the
location of such reservation/s to suit the development without

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 49Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

altering the area of such reservation. Provided however, that no
such shifting of the reservation/s shall be permitted.

(a) beyond 200 m. of the location in the Development
Plan.
(b) beyond the holding of the owner in which — such

reservation is located, and

(c) unless the alternative location is at least similar to
the location of the Development Plan as regards
access, levels etc.

All such alterations in the reservations/alignment of roads
shall be reported by the Planning Authority to Govt. at the time of
sanctioning the layout."

49. As can be seen from the D.C. Rule 13.5, shifting of the reservation

thereunder has to be without altering the size of the area under reser

Besides it is permissible only on three conditions namely, that (1) it cannot be

beyond 200 metres of the original location in the Development Plan, (2) it has to

be within the holding of the owner in which the reservation is located, and (3)

the alternative location ought to have a_- similar access and  tland_ level

original location. Obviously the shifting of the reservation from F.P. No. 110 to a

far off place could not be justified under D.C. rule 13.5.

39

Minor Modifications

50. Section 37 of the MRTP Act, reads as follows: 
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 50Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

"37. Modification of final Development Plan

(1) Where a modification of any part of or any proposal
made in, a final Development plan is of such a nature that it will
not change the character of such Development plan, the Planning
Authority may, or when so directed by the State Government
[shall, within sixty days from the date of such direction, publish a
notice] in the Official Gazette [and in such other manner as may
be determined by it] inviting objections and suggestions from any
person with respect to the proposed modification not later than
One month from the date of such notice; and shall also serve
notice on all persons affected by the proposed modification and
after giving a hearing to any such persons, submit the proposed
modification (with amendments, if any), to the State Government
for sanction.

[(1A) If the Planning Authority fails to issue the notice as
directed by the State Government, the State Government shall
issue the notice, and thereupon the provisions of sub-section (1)
shall apply as they apply in relation to a notice to be published by
a Planning Authority. ]

[(1AA) (a) Notwithstanding anything Contained in sub-sections
(1), (1A) and (2), where the State Government is satisfied that in
the public interest it is necessary to carry out urgently a
modification of any- part. of, or any. proposal made in, a final
Development Plan of such a_- nature that it will not change’ the
character of such Development Plan, the State Government may,
on its own, publish a notice in the Official Gazette, and in such
other manner as may be determined by it, inviting objections and
suggestions from any person with respect to the proposed
modification not later than one month from the date of such
notice and shall also serve notice on all persons affected by the
proposed modification and the Planning Authority.

(b) The State Government shall, after the specified period,
forward a copy of all such objections and suggestions to
the Planning Authority for its say to the Government within
a period of one month from the receipt of the copies of
such objections and suggestions from the Government.

(c) The State Government shall, after giving hearing to the
affected persons and the Planning Authority and = after

making such inquiry as it may consider necessary and
consulting the Director of Town Planning, by notification in

the Official Gazette, publish the approved modifications

with or without changes, and subject to such conditions as

it may deem _ fit, or may decide not to - carry’ out such
modification. On the publication of the modification in the

Official Gazette, the final Development Plan shall be

deemed to have been modified accordingly. ]

[(1-B) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), if
the Slum Rehabilitation Authority appointed under section 3A of
the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and
Redevelopment) Act, 1971(Mah. XXV-III of 1971) is satisfied that
a modification of any part of, or any proposal made in, a final
Development Plan is required to be made for implementation of
the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme declared under the said Act,
then, it may publish a notice in the Official Gazette, and in such
other manner as may be determined by it, inviting objections and
suggestions from any person with respect to the proposed
modification not later than  one~ month from the date of such
notice; and shall also serve notice on all persons affected by the
proposed modification, and after giving a hearing to any _— such
persons, submit the proposed modification (with amendments, if
any) to the State Government for sanction. ]

(2) The State Government may, [make such inquiry9= as it may
consider necessary] and after consulting the Director of Town
Planning by notification in the Official Gazette, sanction the

modification * * * with or without such changes, and subject to
such conditions as it may deem fit or refuse to accord sanction. If
a modification is sanctioned, the final Development Plans shall be
deemed to have been modified accordingly."

51. As seen from this Section, the minor modification under Section 37

(1) has to be such that it will not change the character of the Development Plan.

The section indicates that for setting the procedure under Section 37 in

motion, the Planning Authority has to firstly form an opinion that the proposed

modification will not change the character of the Development Plan. Such

opinion has to be formed by the Planning Authority meaning the general body of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 52Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the Municipal Corporation, since this function is not permitted to be delegated to

41

anybody else under Section 152 of the Act. Thereafter the Planning Authority

has to publish a notice in the official gazette inviting the objections

suggestions from the public with respect to the proposed modification. It is also

required to give a notice to all the persons affected by the proposed

modification. Sub-section (1A) lays down that if the Planning Authority does not

give the notice, the State Government is required to issue the notice as stated

above. The notice to the affected persons in our case will mean notice at least

to the two institutions which had applied for developing a Primary school on this

very plot of land. Thereafter they have to be heard, and the propose

modification with amendments if any, is to be submitted to the State

Government for sanction. Subsequently, after making appropriate enquiries and

after consulting the Director of Town Planning the State Government may under

sub-section (2) sanction the modification with or without appropriate changes, or

subject to such conditions as it may deem fit or refuse to grant the sanction.

52: Sub-section (1AA) of Section 37 lays down the power of the State

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 53Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Government where it feels the urgency for carrying out any such modification.

In that case the State Government may publish the notice in the Official Gazette,

and follow the similar procedure, but subsequently it has to place the proposal

before the general body of the Planning Authority for its say, and thereafter only

it may sanction the modification after consulting the Director of Town Planning in

a similar manner. This shows that in the event of a = minor modifica

general body of the Planning Authority has a say in the matter. The Government

has to invite the objections and suggestions from the public” at large |

42

publishing the notification in the Official Gazette, plus it has to issue a specific

notice to the persons affected by the proposed modification, and last but not the

least it has to consult the Director of Town’ Planning before arriving ©

decision. In the present case nothing of the kind has been done.

53. In the instant case the officers of the Urban Development

Department as well as of the PMC took the stand (until it was possible), that the

procedure under Section 37 will have to be followed. This was because what

was contemplated was a modification of a proposal made in the Development

Plan. A reservation for an amenity was sought to be shifted (which will in fact

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 54Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

mean it was sought to be deleted) from the place where it was provided. If that

was the official view of UDD and PMC, what was required was a compliance of

the procedure under Section 37(1) and (2). Ultimately, since the direction was

given by the State Government, (and if the State Government thought that there

was an urgency), it was necessary for it to act under Section 37 (1AA), and to

publish a notice in the Official Gazette to invite objections and suggestions from

the public at large, and also from the persons affected by the  proposec

modification. Thereafter the State Government was required to send the

proposal to PMC for its say and then = it had to consult the Director

Planning.

Modifications of a substantial nature

54. Where the modification is of a substantial nature, a differs
procedure is prescribed under Section 22A_ of the Act. This Section reads
follows: 
43

" 22A. Modifications of a substantial nature

In section 29 or 31, the expression "of a substantial nature"
used in relation to the modifications made by the Planning

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 55Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Authority or the officer appointed by the State Government
under sub-section (4) of section 21 (hereinafter referred to as

"the said Officer") or the State Government, as the case may

be, in the Draft Development Plan means, -
(a) reduction of more than fifty per cent., or increase by ten per
cent. in area of reservations provided for in clauses (b) to (i)

of section 22; in each planning unit or sector of a draft
Development Plan, in sites admeasuring more than 0.4

hectare in the Municipal Corporation area_ and ‘A’ Class
Municipal area and 1.00 hectare in "Bt Class and Cc} Class

Municipal areas;

(b) all changes which result in the aggregate to a reduction of
any public amenity by more than ten per cent of the area
provided in the planning unit or sector in a draft Development
Plan prepared and _ published under section 26 or published
with modification under section 29 or 31, as the case may be;

(c) reduction in an area of an actually existing site reserved for
a public amenity except for marginal area upto two hundred
square meteres required for essential public amenity or utility
services;

(d) change in the proposal of allocating the use of certain lands
from one zone to any other zone provided by clause (a) of
section 22 which results in increasing the area in that other
zone by ten per cent. in the same planning unit or sector ina
draft Development Plan prepared and published under section
26 or published with modification under section 29 or 31, as
the case may be;

(e) any new reservation made in a_ draft Development Plan

which is not earlier published under section 26, 29 or 31, as
the case may be;

(f) alternation in the Floor Space Index beyond ten per cent. of
the Floor Space Index prescribed in the Development Control
Regulations prepared and _ published under section 26° or
published with modification under section 29 or 31, as the
case may be.]."

Additional requirement of notice in local newspapers before

effecting modifications of substantial nature: 
44

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 56Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

55. The modification under Section 22A requires following of the
procedure under Section 29 of the MRTP Act. It lays down that apart from a
notice in the official gazette, a notice will have to be published in
newspapers for the information at the public at large, so that they may make
their suggestions or file objections thereto if they so deem it fit.
reads as follows: 
"29, Modification made after preparing and

publishing notice of draft Development plan.

Where the modifications made by a Planning Authority or
the said Officer in the draft Development plan are [of a
substantial nature], the Planning Authority or as the case may be,
the said Officer shall publish a notice in the Official Gazette and
also in the local newspapers inviting objections and suggestions
from any person with respect to the proposed modifications not

later than sixty days from the date of such notice; and
thereupon, the provisions of section 28 shall apply in relation to
such suggestions and objections as they apply to suggestions and
objections dealt with under that section."
56. As seen from this Section 22A, it treats modifications of six types as

substantial modifications. They are as follows: 
(a) if a plot is admeasuring more than 0.4 hectare (i.e. 4000 sq. metres) in
the Municipal Corporation area or an A class Municipal area a reduction of more
than 50 per cent would be considered as a substantial modification.

InB&C

class Municipal Areas such a plot has to be of one hectare.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 57Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

(b) secondly, under sub-section (b) all changes which result in the aggregate

to a reduction of any public amenity by more than ten per cent of {

provided in the planning unit are considered a substantial change.

45

(c) where there’ is an actually existing site reserved for a public”) ar

except for marginal area upto two hundred square metres required for essential

public amenities or utility services their reduction will be a substantial

modification.

(d) shifting of the allocation of use of land from zone to zone which results in

increasing the area in the other zone by ten per cent in the same planning unit

will be a substantial modification.

(e) any new reservation made in a draft Development Plan which is not earlier

published will be a substantial modification, and

(fF) alternation in the Floor Space Index beyond’ ten per cent will be

substantial modification.

Importance given to the spaces reserved for public amenities

57. As we have noted, all such substantial modifications can be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 58Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

effected only after following the additional requirement laid down in Section 29

viz. a notice in the local newspapers inviting objections and suggestions within

sixty days from the public at large with respect to the proposed modification

Sub-section (a) deals with reduction of more than fifty percent in area provided

in clauses (b) to (i) of Section 22 which sub-sections are concerned  w:

proposals for designation of land for public purposes such as schools, colleges,

markets, and open spaces, playgrounds, transport and communications, water

supply, drainage and sewerage and other public amenities. It can be seen that

sub-sections (b) and (c) of section 22A give importance to retention of places

reserved for public amenities. Sub-section (b) deals with a reduction of

46

public amenity by more than ten per cent of the area reserved in the planning

unit. Sub-section (c) deals with any reduction in  an_— actually’ existing

reserved for a public amenity (other than marginal area upto 200 sq. me

required for essential public amenities or utility services for e.g. road widening).

Both are treated as substantial modifications. Section 2 (2) of the MR

defines what is an "amenity". It is relevant to note that this definition of amenity

includes primary and secondary schools and colleges and polytechnics. It reads

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 59Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

as follows: 
"2 [i€2)e« "amenity" means roads, streets, open spaces,
parks recreational grounds, play grounds, sports complex, parade
grounds, gardens, markets, parking lots, primary and secondary

schools and colleges and polytechnics, clinics, dispensaries and
hospitals, water supply, electricity supply, street lighting,
sewerage, drainage, public works and includes other utilities,

services and conveniences] ."

58. In the present case we have a situation where the reservation for a

Primary school on a plot of an area of 3450 sq. metres is deleted. Would it not

amount to a substantial modification under sub-section (b) of Section 22A since

it results into deletion of a public amenity in the entire planning unit? Would it

not mean that in view thereof it was necessary to follow the procedure required

under Section 29 of the Act = which provides for a public notice in the

Gazettee and also in the local newspapers inviting objections and suggestions?

Would it not mean that thereafter it was necessary to follow the procedure to

deal with the suggestions and objections taid down while finalizing the

Development Plan under Section 28 of the = Act? Whether the shifting of

reservation is covered under Section 37 or Section 22A is a moot point

47

consider. One thing is however very clear, that it could not be justified under

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 60Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

D.C. Rule 13.5. If the statute provides for doing a particular act in a specified
Manner, it has got to be done in that Manner alone, and not in any
manner.

Alleged Conflict between D.P. Plan and the’ erstwhile’ T.P.
Scheme canvassed for the first time in the High Court Can a provision in the erstwhile T.P. Scheme be relied upon in

the face of a contrary reservation in the subsequent D.P. Plan?

59. In as much as the action of the State Government could

defended under D.C. Rule 13.5, the appellants came up with the submission for

the first time in the High Court and then in this Court that under the erstwhile

Town Planning Scheme, this FePs No. 110 could be developed for residenti

purposes, and that purpose subsisted in spite of the subsequent reservation for a

public purpose on that plot of land under the D.P. Plan.

60. It was pointed out that a Town Planning Scheme was framed under

the then Bombay Town Planning Act of 1915 for Pune City to become effective

from 1.3.1931. Regulation 14. of the Principal scheme framed under that

provided for the areas included in the scheme which were intended mainly for

residential purposes wherein this plot was included as original plot No. 230/C. It

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 61Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

was subsequently allotted F.P. No. 110. There was no reservation on this plot

for any public purpose. The 1915 Act was repealed and replaced by the Bombay

Town Planning Act 1957. w.e.f. 1.4.1957 whereunder the concept of a

Development Plan was introduced. However, by virtue of Section 90 of the 1954

48

Act the previous schemes were saved. The erstwhile Town Planning scheme as

varied, was sanctioned by the State Government w.e.f. 15.8.1979, and

thereunder the permissible user of F.P. No. 110 continued to be residential. In

the meanwhile, in exercise of its power under the 1954 Act, the State

Government sanctioned the Development Plan of Pune City w.e.f. 15.8.1966

whereunder F.P. No. 110-112 were reserved for a garden. The 1954 Act was

repealed and replaced by the MRTP Act 1966 w.e.f. 11.1.1967. By virtue of

Section 165 of the MRTP Act, however, the erstwhile Principal T.P. scheme (as

varied), as well as the D.P. Plan were both saved. Subsequently, when the D.P.

Plan of Pune City was revised in 1982 and finalized in 1987 under the provisions

of the MRTP Act, the reservation on the plot was initially proposed to be changed

for a play-ground, but ultimately shifted for a primary school in the final 1987 DP

Plan.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 62Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

61. It is contended on behalf of the landowner and the developer that

the permission for the user of the concerned plot of land for residential purposes

under the T.P. Scheme effective from 15.8.1979 continued to survive by virtue of

the saving clause under Section 165 (2) of the MRTP Act, and, therefore,

order passed by the Government on 3.9.1996 as well as the commencement

certificates were valid even on that count. It is submitted that until the Town

Planning scheme is varied under Section 39 read with 92 of MRTP Act,

proposals in the Final Development Plan of 1987 cannot have any effect on the

land covered by the erstwhile Town’ Planning scheme. The Development Plan

and Town Planning scheme will both have their independent operation until the

49

Town Planning scheme is varied to bring it in accord with the Development Plan.

As noted earlier that right from 8.5.1979, when the landowner issued purchase

notice, and led the State Government and PMC to acquire the plot of land, this

plea was never raised (and the High Court would have been within its rights not

to entertain this plea on the ground of acquiescing into the change of user under

the D.P. Plan). The plea having been considered and rejected in the impugned

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 63Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

judgment, is canvassed once again in this Court. To consider’ this plea

becomes necessary to examine the relevant provisions of the Act.

Relevant provisions of the Act in the context of the D.P. Plan as

against the erstwhile T.P. Scheme

62. The preamble of the MRTP Act shows that this is an Act to make

provisions for:

(1) planning the development and use of land in regions established for thi

purpose and for constitution of regional planning boards therefor,

(2) to make better provisions for the preparation of development plans wi

view to ensuring that T.P. Schemes are made in the proper Manner ail

their execution is made effective,

(3) to provide for the creation of new towns by means of development

authorities,

(4) to make provisions for the compulsory acquisition of land required for public

purposes in respect of the plans, and

50

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 64Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

(5) for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.

63. (i) Chapter I of the Act contains the Preliminary provisions. Chapter II

of the Act is concerning the Regional Plans. Chapter III is about the

Development Plan, and Chapter IV about Control of Development and Use of

Land included in Development Plans. Chapter V is about the T.P. Schemes.

(ii) Section 3 of the Act permits the State Government to establish any

area in the State to be a Region. A Regional Plan is supposed to be prepared for

various subjects which are mentioned in Section 14 of the = Act. The

‘Development Plan' is defined under Section 2 (9) of the Act as a plan for the

development or re-development of the area within the jurisdiction of a planning

authority. Section 2 (19) defines the Planning Authority to mean a_ loc

authority, and it includes some other specified authorities also. There

dispute that the development plan has to be prepared ‘in accordance with the

provisions of a Regional plan' which is what is specifically stated in Section 21 (1)

of the Act.

(iii) It is, however, disputed by the developer that the T.P. s

which is normally supposed to be a detailed scheme for a smaller part

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 65Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Municipal Area has necessarily to be in consonance with the development plan.

As against this submission we have the mandate of Section 39 of the Act, which

reads as follows: 
"39. Variation of town planning scheme by
Development Plan.

51

Where a final Development plan contains proposals which
are in variation, or modification of those made in a town planning
scheme which has been sanctioned by the State Government
before the commencement of this Act, the Planning Authority
shall vary such scheme suitably under section 92 to the extent
necessary by the proposals made in the final Development plan."

This Section states that the T.P. scheme shall be suitably varied to

the extent necessary wherever the final development plan contains proposals

which are in variation or modification of the proposals contained in the

Scheme. In the instant case, we are concerned with the final development plan

of 1987 which contains the reservation for a Primary School on F.P. No.110 as

against the plot being placed ina residential zone in the final T.P. scheme of

1979. It is submitted by the appellant that the planning authority may

steps to vary the T.P. scheme suitably to bring it in consonance with the D.P

plan, but until that is done, the provisions in the T.P. scheme will survive. The

High Court has rejected this submission by holding that the D.P. plan overrides

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 66Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the T.P. Scheme.

64. As noted above, Section 39 lays down that the T.P. Scheme is to be

varied suitably in accordance with the _ OD.P. Plan under Section 92 of t

Section 92 appears in Chapter V which is on Town Planning schemes. The first

section in this chapter V is Section 59. Section 59 reads as follows: 
"59: Preparation and contents of Town’ Planning
Scheme

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law for
the time being in force(a) a Planning Authority may for the purpose of implementing
the proposals in the final Development Plan, prepare one or more
town planning schemes for the area within its jurisdiction, or any
part thereof;

52

(b) a town planning scheme may make provision for any of
the following matters, that is to say(i) any of the matters specified in section 22;
(ii) the laying out or _ re-laying out of _ land, eithe
vacant or already built upon, including areas’ of
comprehensive development;
(iii) the suspension, as far as may be necessary for
the proper carrying out of the scheme, of any rule,
by-law, regulation, notification or order made or
issued under any law’ for the time being in_ force
which the Legislature of the State is competent to
make;
(iv) such other matter not inconsistent with the
object of this Act, as may be directed by the State
Government.
(2) In making provisions in a draft town planning scheme for
any of the matter referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1), it shall
be lawful for a Planning Authority with the approval of the Director
of Town Planning and subject to the provisions’ of section 68 to
provide for suitable amendment of the Development plan."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 67Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

As can be seen, Section 59 states two things: firstly the opening part of sub
section 1 of Section 59 states that the T.P. scheme is to be prepared "subject to

the provisions of this Act". Thereafter, Sub-section 1(a) of this sectio

specifically states that the planning authority is to prepare one or_ more

schemes for the area within its jurisdiction "for the purpose of implementing the

proposals in the final Development Plan". Thus, Section 39 read with Section 59

do indicate the approach of legislature, namely, superiority of the D.P. plan over

the T.P. scheme.

65. The learned senior counsel for the developer, Shri Naphade relied

on the provisions contained in Section 59 (1) (b) (i), and 59 (2) of the Act in

support of his arguments. Section 59 (1) (b) (i) provides that a town planning

scheme may make provision amongst others for any of the matters specified in

53

Section 22 of the Act. Section 22 lays down as to what ought to be the contents

of a Development Plan. Section 59 (2) states that in making the draf

scheme for any of the matters referred to in sub-section 1 (b), it shall be lawful

for a planning authority to provide for suitable amendments of the Development

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 68Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Plan. It is, therefore, submitted that there is no primacy between the

Development Plan and the T.P. scheme. It is contended that if the purpose of

the T.P. Scheme is only to implement the Development Plan, it will mil:

against the plain reading of Section 51 (2) and 59 (1) (b) and that, in such a

case, Section 59 (1) (b) will become otiose. Shri Naphade, therefore, submitted

that the D.P. Plan and the T.P. Scheme both are of equal strength.

66. While examining this submission, we must note that Section

requires the T.P. scheme to be varied to the extent necessary in accordance with

the final Development Plan. The provision in Section 59 (1) (b) (i) is infact made

to see to it that there’ is no conflict between the T.P. scheme and

Development Plan. Otherwise, the question will arise as to what meaning will be

given to Section 59 (1) (a) which specifically states that the T.P. scheme is to be

prepared for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the final Development

Plan. Merely because Section 59 (1) (b) provides that the T.P. scheme may make

provision for any of the matters specified in Section 22, the T.P. scheme cannot

be placed on the same pedestal as a Development Plan. Section 59 (2) is only

an enabling provision. It may happen that in a given situation a suita

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 69Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

amendment of the Development Plan may as_- well become necessary while

seeing to it that the T.P. scheme is in consonance with the Development Plan.

54

Section 59 (2) will only mean that the legislature has given an elbow room to the

planning authority to amend the Development Plan if that is so necessary, so

that there is no conflict between the T.P. Scheme and the D.P. Plan. In fact

what is indicated by stating that "it shall be lawful to carry out,

amendment" is that normally such a reverse action is not expected, but

given case if it becomes so necessary, it will not be unlawful. Use of this phrase

in fact shows the superiority of the D.P. Plan over the T.P. scheme. Besides, the

phrase put into service in this sub-section is only “to provide for a

amendment'. This enabling provision for an appropriate amendment in the D.P.

plan cannot therefore, be raised to the level of the provision contained in Section

39 which mandates that the planning authority shall vary the T.P. scheme if the

final D.P. Plan is  in- variation with the T.P. Scheme sanctioned before

commencement of the MRTP_ Act. It also indicates that subsequent to the

commencement of the Act, a T.P. Scheme will have to be inconsonance with the

D.P. Plan. Similarly, Section 59 (1) (b) (i) cannot take away the force of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 70Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

provision contained in Section 59 (1) (a) of the Act. As noted above, Section 39

specifically directs that the planning authority shall vary the T.P. scheme to the

extent necessary by the proposal made in the’ final Development Plan, and

Section 59 (1) (a) gives the purpose of the T.P. scheme, viz. that i

implementing the proposals contained in the final Development Plan. Under

Section 31 (6) of the act, a Development plan which has came into operation is

binding on the planning authority. The Planning Authority cannot act contrary to

D.P. plan and grant Development permission to defeat the provision of the D.P.

55

plan. Besides, it cannot be ignored that a duty’ is cast on every pl

authority specifically under Section 42 of the Act to take steps as_ may

necessary to carry out the provisions of the plan referred in Chapter III of the

Act, namely the Development Plan. Section 46 of the Act also tlays~ dov

specifically that the planning authority in considering an application’ for

permission for development shall have "due regard" to the provisions of @

draft or any final plan or proposal submitted or sanctioned under the Act. It

indicates that the moment a Draft Plan is proposed, a permission for a contrary

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 71Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

development can no more be granted, since it will lead to a situation of conflict.

Section 52 of the Act in fact provides for penalty for unauthorised development

or for use otherwise then in conformity with the development plan. Thus, when

it comes to the development in the area of a local authority, a conjoint reading

of the relevant sections makes the primacy of the Development Plan sufficiently

clear.

67. Much emphasis was laid on Section 69 (6) which reads as follows: 
"(6) The provisions of Chapter IV shall, mutatis mutandis,
apply in relation to the development and use of land included in a
town planning scheme in so far as they are not inconsistent with
the provisions of the Chapter."

It was, therefore, submitted that thus the provisions of Chapter IV

which are about the Control of Development and use of land included’ in

Development Plan, are mutatis mutandis applicable to the development and the

use of land included in the T.P. scheme, and therefore the D.P. plan and T.P.

scheme are on par.

56
68. Now, it is material to note that sub-sections (1) to (5) of Section 69
operate when the draft T.P. scheme is under preparation. Sub-section (6) will

have to be read on that background because this sub-section itself states that

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 72Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

provisions of Chapter IV will apply’ in relation to the development of t

included in a T.P. scheme "in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provision of

this Chapter", i.e. Chapter V on Town Planning Schemes wherein Section 69 is

placed. Chapter IV is on control of Development and use of land included in

Development Plans. And as noted above, Section 59 (1) (a) which is the first

section of Chapter V clearly contains the direction that the T.P. scheme is to be

prepared for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the final Development

Plan. Therefore, merely because by incorporating the provisions of Chapter IV

those provisions are made applicable to T.P. schemes, the mandate of Section 59

(1) (a) cannot be lost sight of.

69. It is then submitted by the appellant that the Development

and the T.P. scheme operate independent of each other, and, until the §

Government exercises its power of eminent domain under the Development Plan,

and acquire the land, the landowner can develop his property as per the user

permitted under the T.P. scheme. In view of the scheme of the relevant sections

and particularly Section 46 which we have noted above, this submission cannot

be accepted. It will mean permitting a development contrary to the provisions of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 73Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the Development Plan, knowing fully well that the user under the T.P. scheme is

at variance with the Development Plan. Any such interpretation will make

provisions of Section 39, 42, 46 and 52 meaningless.

57

70. There is one more aspect of the matter. Section 43 of the Act lays

down that after the date on which the declaration of intention’ to _ prep

Development Plan is published, no person shall carry out any development on

land without the permission of the Planning Authority. The principal part of this

section reads as follows: 
"43. Restrictions on development of land

After the date on which the declaration of intention’ to
prepare a Development plan for any area is published in the
Official Gazette {or after the date on which a notification
specifying any undeveloped area as a notified area, or any area
designated as a site for a new town, is published in Official
Gazette] no person shall institute or change the use of any land
or carry out any development of land without the permission in
writing of the Planning Authority."

71: This section will have to be read along with the _ requireme
provided in Section 39. Section 39 provides for a T.P. Scheme sanctioned and
subsisting prior to the Development Plan. The section mandates that such

prior scheme shall be varied to the extent necessary by the proposals made in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 74Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the final Development Plan. Section 43 provides that once the declaration of

intention to prepare a Development Plan is gazetted, no development contrary

thereto can be permitted. AS provided under Section 59 (1) (a), the :

planning scheme is to be prepared for the purpose of implementing the

proposals in the final Development Plan. Therefore, even if such a variation as

directed under Section 39 does not take place, the land cannot be put to use in

any way in contradiction with the provision in the D.P. Plan. In the instant case,

we have a provision of the T.P. Scheme effective from 15.8.1979 as against the

D.P. Plan containing a contrary provision which was notified on 18.9.1982. Shri

58

Dholakia, learned senior counsel appearing for the State Government, therefore,

rightly submitted that in view of Section 165 of the MRTP Act, if the construction

was completed, partly started or plans were submitted, or any such appropriate

steps were taken prior to 18.9.1982, the same could have been permitted. Once

the State Government published the draft Development Plan on 18.9.1982,

providing for the reservation for a primary school, any construction contr

thereto could not be permitted. This can only be the’ interpretation of

provisions contained in Section 39 read with Section 43 and Section 165 of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 75Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

MRTP Act. For convenience, we may refer to Section 165 (1) and (2), which

read as follows: 
"165. Repeal and saving.

(1)

(2)

The Bombay Town Planning Act, 1954 and sections

219 to 226A and clause (xxxvi) of sub-section (2) of

72. The learned senior counsel Shri Virendra Tulzapurkar appearing for

the tenants went to the extent of contending that by provisions in

Scheme are superior to those in the D.P. Plan. In support to his submission he

relied upon the judgment of a Division Bench of Gujarat High Court

Gordhanbhai Vs. The Anand Municipality & Ors. reported in XVI (1975)

Gujarat Law Report 558 which was under the Bombay’ Town Planning Act

1954 (the 1954 Act for short) as applicable to Gujarat. The petitioner therein

was aggrieved by the development permission granted by the Anand Municipality

to the respondents Nos. 4 to 12 to put up a structure on the plot adjoining to his

plot. One of the objections raised by the petitioner’ was that

construction did not observe the margins prescribed in the regulations framed

under the Development Plan (comparable to the D.C. regulations in the present

60

case). The respondents pointed out that the regulations which were published

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 77

the

inGirish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

and sanctioned by the State Government as a part of the T.P. scheme specifically

provided that no margin should be imposed on the particular final plot of the

respondents Nos. 4 to 12. In view thereof, the Division Bench in para 6 of its

judgment referred to Section 18 (2) (k) of the 1954 Act which

provided that the Town Planning scheme may provide for the suspension, so far

as may be necessary for the proper carrying out of the scheme of any rule, by
law, regulation, notification or order made or issued under any Act of the State

Legislature. Since that had been done, the permission for construction in the

particular case could not be faulted. It was in this context

Bench observed that the provisions of the scheme which are contrary to those

specifice

that — the

regulations shall prevail over the same. It is material to note that this provision in

Section 18 (2) (k) of the 1954 Act is pari-materia to Section 59 (1) (b) (iii) of the

MRTP Act. It is also material to note that like Section 59 (1) (a) of the MRTP

Act, Section 18 (1) of the 1954 Act provides as follows: 
"Making and contents of town planning scheme

18. Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law
for the time being in force: (1) a local authority for the purpose of

implementing the proposals in the final
development plan may make one or more
town planning schemes for the area within
its jurisdiction or any part thereof;"

Section 18 of the 1954 Act as well as Section 59 of the MRTP Act

provide for suspension of the regulations in a given case by making a specific

61

provision in the T.P. scheme, which is basically with the object of implementing

the proposals in the Final Development Plan. This judgment cannot therefore be

relied upon to canvass a_ general proposition that the provisions in the

Planning scheme are superior to the Development Plan.

The need for a holistic interpretation

73. The provision of a statute are required to be read together after

noting the purpose of the Act, namely that there should be an_-— orderly

development in the region, local authority as well as in the town” area

MRTP Act does not envisage a situation of conflict. Therefore one will have to

iron out the edges to read those provisions of the Act which are sli

incongruous, so that all of them are read in consonance with the object of the

Act, which is to bring about an orderly and planned development. The provision

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 79Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

of Section 165 can not be read to mean a right to carry out ae de

contrary to the Development Plan, and in any case without a valid development

permission particularly when the landowner had not taken any step in pursuance

to the erstwhile T.P. scheme nor had objected to the changes brought in by the

authorities by following the due _ process’ of _ law. The submissions of Sh

Naphade and Tulzapurkar with respect to the alleged conflict between T.P. and

D.P. can not, therefore, be accepted.

"33. Interpretation must depend on the text and
the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well
say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour
Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That
interpretation is best which makes the textual
interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best
interpreted when’ we know why it was enacted. With this
knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then
section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word
by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment,
with the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context,
its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take
colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at
without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses
we must look at the Act as a whole and = discover what each
section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and
designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No
part of a statute and no word of a statute can be
construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so

that every word has a place and_- everything is in its
place."......

(emphasis supplied)

75. The counsel for the landowner criticised the impugned judgment

for accepting the observations of another Division Bench of Bombay High Court

in Rusy Kapadia v. State of Maharashtra reported in [1998 (2) ALL MR

181], In that matter certain private land was reserved in the D.P. plan of Pune

for a public park. The landowner had no objection to the same, but the land was

not acquired. The landowner sold the land to some other persons, who moved

the Government for de-reservation of the land to use it for residential purpose.

The Government invited objections under Section 37 of the MRTP~ Act and

thereafter issued the notification granting de-reservation. At that stage

other citizens filed this PIL challenging that notification on the ground that the

land was ear-marked for environmental purposes and should not be de-reserved.

It was submitted in that matter on behalf of the purchasers of the land that in

63

the T.P. scheme the use for residential purpose was permissible, and since the

T.P. scheme was sanctioned subsequent to the development plan, it shall prevail.

Rejecting that argument, the Division Bench observed in para 8 of its judgment

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 81Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

as follows: 
seeeae We heard and also perused the provisions with the
assistance of the Ld. Counsel for the parties. Town Planning
Scheme is provided and dealt with by Chapter V of the Act. This
Chapter has beginning with Section 59 and opening of the section
itself refers that the provisions of this Chapter are subject to the
provisions of the Act. The provisions precedent to section 59 are
from section 1 to section 58 which include section 31, sub-section
(6) which proclaims that the Draft Plan is final and binding on the
Planning Authority. As such the binding force would carry even
when they anyway deal with the Town Planning Scheme.
Besides this section 39 and section 42 of the Act unequivocally
indicate that the Development Plan has to definitely prevail over
anything and everything including the Town Planning Scheme. In

view of this the submission is without any merit."

76. The Division Bench deciding Rusy Kapadia's case (supra) referred

to para 25 of the Judgment of this Court in Bangalore Medical Trust Vs. B.S.

Muddapa_ reported in [1991 (4) scc 54] to emphasize the importance’ of

protecting environment. The High Court quashed the decision of the Government

granting de-reservation but kept it in abeyance for a period of two years, and

directed that if during this period the private respondents (i.e. purchasers of the

land) provided adequate green area as envisaged in the development plan, this

order will not operate. This order of the High Court in Rusy Kapadia (supra)

was challenged by those private respondents, the judgment in which Appeal is

reported in the case of Raju S. Jethmalani Vs. State of Maharashtra

reported in [2005 (11) SCC 222]. This Court in the case of Raju Jethmalani

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 82Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

64

noted that the observations in Bangalore Medical Trust were in the context of

Section 38 (A) of that Act. The Court also noted that though the development

plan provided the area for the - garden, no proceedings for acquisition of

concerned plot had ever been initiated. In that context, the court observed that

there is no prohibition for preparing the development plan comprising the private

land, but the plan cannot be implemented unless’ the said private land \

acquired. It was for this reason that the court allowed the appeal and set aside

the order in Rusy Kapadia's case, but this time directed the petitioners of the

PIL (i.e. Rusy Kapadia & Ors.) to raise funds in six months if they wanted the

park to be maintained, in order to assist the Government to acquire the land,

failing which it will be open to the appellants to develop the land. This direction

was given because the State Government and PMC had expressed inability t

raise the necessary funds to acquire the concerned plot of land. It is material to

note that in Raju  Jethmalani's case this Court’ did not deal with the

controversy concerning the superiority of the Development Plan vis-a-vis the T.P.

scheme, nor can the Judgment be read as laying down a_- proposition’ that

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 83Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

development contrary to the OD.P. plan is permissible. The observations in

case of Rusy Kapadia as quoted above are approved in the presently impugned

judgment, and have been once again reiterated by another Division Bench of the

Bombay High Court in Indirabai  Bhalchandra Bhajekar Vs. The Pune

Municipal Corporation and Ors., reported in [2009 (111) Bom LR 4251]

Having noted the inter-relation amongst the various sections of the statute, in

65

our view, it cannot be said that the T.P. scheme is either superior or of equal

strength as the Development Plan.

77. The counsel for the developer’ then relied upon the judgment

this Court in Laxmi Narayan Bhattad Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in

[2003 (5) SCC 413] for further supporting the submission in this behalf. The

appellant in this case was allotted an alternative plot of land and-~ mo

compensation under an award when part of his land was acquired to implement

the T.P. scheme finalized in 1987. The appellant however wanted additionally

the Transferable Development Rights (TDR) as provided under Development

Control Regulations framed later in 1991. This Court declined to accept

submission of the appellant. It was held that the appellant will be eligible only

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 84Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

for the benefits under the T.P. scheme, since the acquisition of his land was to

implement the — same. The OD.C. Regulations of 1991 had come subsequently.

There was no provision for TDR under the T.P. scheme and therefore, the

appellant could not get 7.D.R which are provided subsequently in the D.C

Regulations of 1991. This judgment also cannot be read as laying down that the

T.P. scheme will prevail over or is of equal strength as the D.P. plan.

78. Thus from the analysis of the relevant provisions and_ the

judgments it is clear that the right claimed under the erstwhile T.P. scheme could

not be sustained in the teeth of the reservation for a Primary school under the

1987 D.P. plan. The submission in this behalf cannot be accepted.

66

Additional submissions in this Court in defence of the

Government Order: 
79. The appellants came up with some more submissions in this Court.

They submitted that the shifting was protected under Rule 6.6.2.2, and t

reference to Rule 13.5 in the Government's order dated 3.9.1996 was erroneous.

Now, this Rule 6.6.2.2 reads as follows: 
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 85Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

"6.6.2.2 In specific cases where a_ clearly demonstrable
hardship is caused the Commissioner may by special written
permission

(i) Permit any of the dimensions/provisions prescribed by
these rules to be modified provided the relaxation sought does

not violate the health safety, fire safety, structural safety and
public safety of the inhabitants, the buildings and_ the
neighborhood. However, no relaxation from the set back

required from the road boundary or FSI shall be granted under
any circumstances.

While granting permissions under (i) conditions may be
imposed on size, cost or duration of the structure abrogation of
claim of compensation payment of deposit and its forfeiture for
non-compliance and payment of premium."

As can be seen from this Rule it provides for variations with respect

to dimensions and structural requirements. This rule 6.6.2.2 is a part of Rule 6

which contains the ‘Procedure for obtaining building permission/ commencement

certificates’. It does not deal with shifting of a particular reservation from one

plot to another which is covered under Rule 13.5 (with certain restrictions) to

which we have already referred. Thus Rule 6.6.2.2 has no application at all.

80. The request of the landowner was to shift the reservation

primary school from F.P. No. 110, and to grant him the permission for

development under Section 45 of the Act. It is also material to note that though

subsequent to the Government orders, Commencement Certificates were issued,

67

there was no order specifically setting aside the earlier order of the City Engineer

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 86Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

of PMC _ passed under Section 45 of the MRTP-~ Act rejecting the building

permission by his letter/order dated 6.11.1995. We are, therefore, required to

infer from the Commencement Certificate which refers to Section 44 and 4

(alongwith other sections) that the appeal against the order of the City Engineer

is impliedly allowed under Section 47 of the Act. This is because there is no such

specific mention of reversal of the order dated 6.11.1995 even in the aforesaid

order of the State Government dated 3.9.1996.

81. It was therefore contended’ on behalf of the developer that

order passed by the Government made a reference to a wrong provision of law.

It was submitted that Section 47 was erroneously relied upon, and the order was

in fact an order passed under Section 50 of the Act.

Section 50 reads as follows: 
"50. Deletion of reservation of designated land _ for

interim draft of final Development Plan.

(1) The Appropriate Authority (other than the Planning
Authority), if it is satisfied that the land is not or no longer required
for the public purpose for which it is designated or reserved or
allocated in the interim or the draft Development plan or plan for
the area of Comprehensive development or the final Development
plan, may request-(a) the Planning Authority to sanction the deletion

of such designation or _ reservation or allocation from’ the

interim or the draft Development plan or plan for the area of

Comprehensive development, or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 87Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

(b) the State Government to sanction the deletion
of such designation or reservation or allocation from the final
Development plan.

(2) On receipt of such request from the Appropriate

Authority, the Planning Authority, or as the case may be, the
State Government may make an order sanctioning the deletion of

68

such designation or reservation or allocation from the relevant
plan:

Provided that, the Planning Authority, or as the case may
be, the State Government may, before making any order, make
such enquiry as it may consider necessary and satisfy itself that
such reservation or designation or allocation is no _ longer
necessary in the public interest.

(3) Upon an order under sub-section (2) being made,
the land shall be deemed to be released from such designation,
reservation, or, as the case may be, allocation and shall become
available to the owner’ for the purpose of development § as
otherwise permissible in the case of adjacent’ land, under the
relevant plan."

As can be seen, Section 50 provides for deletion of a reservation at

the instance of an Appropriate authority (other than the planning authority) for

whose benefit the reservation is made. Such is not the present case. Under

sub-section (1) of Section 50, the appropriate authority has to be satisfied that

the land is not required for the public purpose for which it is rese

"Appropriate authority" is defined under Section 2 (3) of the Act to mean a public

authority on whose behalf the land is designed for a public purpose in any plan

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 88Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

or scheme and which it is authorised to acquire. In the instant case

acquiring body is PMC, and it will mean the general body of PMC. Assuming that

the section applies in the instance case, the general body has to be satisfied that

the land is no longer required for the public purpose for which it is designed or

reserved. In the instant case, it is on the direction of the Minister of State that

the Municipal Commissioner has given a report which has been used by the State

Government to pass an order of shifting the reservation from F.P. No.110. The

officers of the Planning Authority as well as of the concerned Governmen

69

department were not in favour of deleting the reservation. The Commissioner's

opinion could not have been treated as the opinion. of PMC. Under cer

circumstances the Municipal Commissioner can  act- on behalf of the Municipa

Corporation, and those sections are specifically mentioned in Section 152 of the

MRTP Act. Section 50 is not one of those sections and, therefore, the

Government could not have made any  such_ order’ sanctioning the deletion o

reservation on the basis of the report of the Municipal Commissioner. Section 50

is, therefore, of no help to the appellants.

82. One of the sections which was pressed into service to defend the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 89Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

directions of the State Government dated 3.9.1996 and 29.7.1998 and the

actions of the Municipal Commission was Section 154 (1) of the MRTP Act. This

section reads as follows: 
"154. Control by State Government

(1) Every Regional Board, Planning Authority and
Development Authority = shall carry out such directions or
instructions as may be issued from time to time by the State
Government for the efficient administration of this Act.

(2) If in, or in connection with, the exercise of its powers

and discharge of it functions by any’ Regional’ Board,
Planning Authority or Development Authority under this Act,

any dispute arises between the Regional Board, Planning
Authority or Development Authority, and the State
Government, the decision of the State Government on such

dispute shall be final."

It was submitted that the State Government was thus entrusted with the

over-all control in the interest of efficient administration, and its directions had to

be followed by the Planning Authority, and such directions could not be faulted

on any count. In a similar situation in Bangalore Medical Trust (supra), a

70

reservation for a public park was sought to be shifted for the benefit of a private

nursing home. Amongst others Section 65 of the Bangalore Development Act,

1976 was sought to be pressed into service which authorised the Government to

issue directions to carry out the purposes of the act. This Court observed in para

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 90Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

52 of that judgment that the section authorises the Government to issue

directions to ensure that provisions of law are obeyed and not to empower itself

to proceed contrary to law. In the present matter, it is to be see

section provides for directions or instructions to be given by the State

Government for the efficient administration of the Act. This implies directions for

that purpose which are normally general in character, and not for the benefit of

any particular party as in the present case. The provisions of law c

disregarded and ignored merely because what was done, was being done at the

instance of the State Government. Consequently, Section 154 cannot save the

directions issued by the State Government or the actions of the Municipa

Commissioner in pursuance thereof.

83. Thus, the reliance on these provisions is of no use to

appellants. It was submitted that while passing the order the Government has

referred to a wrong provision of law and reference to a wrong provision of law

does not vitiate the order if the order can be traced to a legitimate source of

power. Reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in PR Naidu

Government of Andhra Pradesh (reported in AIR 1977 SC 854) = [1977

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 91Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

(3) SCC 160] and VL and Co. v. Bennett Coloman and Co. [AIR 1977 SCC

1884] = [1977 (1) SCC 561]. In the instant case, however, the order of the

71

Government dated 3.9.1996 cannot be traced to any legitimate source of power,

and therefore, the situation cannot be remedied by reference to other sources of

power. The Division Bench has therefore, rightly commented on this submission

in paragraph 180 of its judgment that “the rub is that the action taken by the

Planning authority was otherwise not legal and justified'. It could not therefore

be justified by reference to other provisions of law because basically the decision

itself was illegal.

84. Thus the submission canvassed on behalf of the appellants is that

although the landowner never objected to the reservation either for a garden or

a primary school during the process of the revision of the D.P. Plan during 1982

to 1987, and although he had received the compensation for its acquisition, he

retained the right to develop the property’ for residential purposes’ merely

because under the erstwhile Town Planning scheme residential use was

permissible, and it is supposed to be saved under Section 165 (2) of the MRTP

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 92Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Act. However, as seen from the conjoint reading of Section 39, 42 and 46, and

the scheme of the = Act, such a submission cannot be accepted. That = apar‘

ultimately it was contended = on his behalf the deletion of the reservatio

primary school on this plot u/s 37 of the MRTP Act is not necessary, and the

order passed by the State Government in his favour can be explained u/s 50 of

the MRTP Act read with D.C. Rule 6.6.2.2. As we have seen Section 50 as well

as D.C. Rule 6.6.2.2. have no application to the present case, nor can the power

of the State Government under Section 154. of the = Act help the appellan

Besides, independent of one's right either under the D.P. Plan or the |

72

Scheme, one ought to have a permission for development granted by the

planning authority traceable to an appropriate provision of law. In the present

case there is none. The appellants are essentially raising all these submissions

to justify a construction which is without a valid = and legal development

permission. The appellants have gone on improving and tried to change their

stand from time to time with a view to justify Government's order in their favour

However, “Orders are not like old wine becoming better as they grow older" as

aptly stated by Krishna Iyer J. in para 8 of Mohinder Singh Gill Vs.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 93Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Election Commissioner, New Delhi reported in 1978 (ay scc 405.

submissions of the appellants in defence of the decision of the State Government

are devoid of any merit and deserve to be rejected.

Legality of the acquisition of the land:

Whether the acquisition lapses on account of change of purpose

of acquisition

85. As seen earlier, the letter of the Landowner had

subsequent steps for acquisition. The landowner was interested in good return

for his land. The tenants were interested only in the rehabilitation on the same

plot of land. That was their stand until the award dated 12.5.1983. The Civil

Court has held the acquisition for the changed purpose under the D.P Plan as

bad in law on the’ ground that the initially designated public

acquisition was changed. Was the civil suit maintainable? Was the view taken

by the Civil Court a correct view? We are required to go into that question also,

73

since the order of the Civil Court is sought to be defended by the landowner as

well as by the developer.

86. The Learned Civil Judge Senior Division set aside the award by his

judgment and decree dated 23.4.1990 on the ground that though the land was

initially proposed to be acquired for a garden, it was ultimately to be used for

another public purpose i.e. setting up a primary school. It was contended on

behalf of the developer that in the instant case the declaration under Section 6

of the L.A. Act was issued when the land was reserved for a garden, and the

purpose of acquisition must subsist as initially designated until the possession of

the land is taken. The Court accepted the contention that the acquisition had

lapsed due the change of purpose of reservation by the time the award

made. In the instant case, the award was made on 12.5.1983, but pursuant to

the award the possession of the plot was not taken in the circumstance

mentioned earlier. According to the appellant the acquisition was not complete,

and the jurisdiction to further continue with the acquisition was no lone

available.

87. Two judgments of Bombay High Court were relied upon on behalf

of the appellants i.e. Industrial Development & Investment Company Pvt.

Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in 1988 Mh.LJ 1027. (which = was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 95Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

relied upon by the Learned Civil Judge Senior Division also), and Santu Kisan

Khandwe Vs. Special Land Acquisition Officer No. 2 Nasik & Ors reported

in 1995 (1) Mh.LJ 363, in support of the proposition that the purpose (

acquisition must subsists till vesting. As far as the first judgment of the High

74

Court in the case of Industrial Development Company is concerned, the same is

about the provisions of MRTP Act, and it has been specifically overruled by this

Court in Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay Vs. Industrial

Development Investment Co. Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. reported in 1996 (11) SCC

501. It was a case where the concerned parcel of land situated in Ol

Mumbai was acquired by the Municipal Corporation under the MRTP Act initially

for the setting up of a Sewage Purification Plant, but subsequently the land was

sought to be used for the residential and commercial purposes of its employees,

since this Sewage Treatment Plant was shifted to another parcel of land. This

utilisation was held to be completely valid and permissible by K. Ramaswamy, J.

88. The appellants before us contended that Majmudar, J., the other Learned Judge deciding the
I.D.I Co's. case had taken a different view on the issue of change of user, and therefore, the issue
remained undecided, and that the view taken by the Bombay High Court in the above referred two
judgments deserved acceptance. The appellants submitted that Majmudar, J. agreed with K.
Ramaswamy, J. only to the extent that the petition filed by the respondents in the High Court
deserved to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches. As far as the ground of change of
purpose is concerned, Majmudar J., expressed his different opinion in the following few sentences:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 96Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

"33. Even though the proposal under Section 126(1) is for acquisition of land for a
specified public purpose, if the planning authority wants to acquire the land
subsequently for any other public purpose earmarked in the modified scheme as has
happened in the present case that is if the appellant-Corporation which had initially
proposed to acquire the land for extension of sewerage treatment plant wanted
subsequently to acquire the same land for its staff quarters then such a purpose must
be specifically indicated in the plan meaning thereby that the land must be shown to
be reserved for the staff quarters of the Corporation and then the Special Planning
Authority which had become the appropriate planning authority, i.e., BMRDA would
be required to issue a fresh proposal under Section 126(1) read with Section 40(3)(e)
and Section 116 of the MRTP Act and follow the gamut thereafter. So long as that was
not done the earlier proposal under Section 126(1) and the consequential notification
by the State Government under Section 126(2) which had lost their efficacy could not
be revitalised.......... "

89. The appellants relied upon the judgment of this Court in Special Land Acquisition Bombay Vs.
M/s Godrej & Boyce reported in AIR 1987 SC 2421, in support of their contention, that the purpose
for acquisition must continue until possession is taken. In that matter this Court held that the title
to the land vests in the Government only when the possession is taken. It is however, material to
note that this judgment is concerning Section 16 of the L.A. Act. As far as this submission is
concerned, as held by K. Ramaswamy J., in I.D.A Co's case (supra), one must note that the scheme
of MRTP Act is different from that under the L.A. Act. In para 11 and 12 of his judgment in I.D.I
Co's. case (supra) he has specifically held that Section 126 (1) of the MRTP Act is a substitute for the
notification under Section 4 of the L.A. Act. A declaration under Section 126 (2) is equivalent to a
declaration under Section 6 of the L.A. Act. The objections of the persons concerned are considered
before such land gets earmarked for public purpose in the plan. Therefore, there is no need of any
enquiry as under Section 5A of the L.A. Act. Section 126 (1) (c) specifically states that when an
application is made to the State Government for acquiring the land under the L.A. Act, the land vests
absolutely with the Planning Authority. Therefore, it was held that in the scheme of the MRTP Act, it
is not necessary that the original public purpose should continue to exist till the award was made
and possession taken.

90. The observations of K. Ramaswamy, J. in paragraph 11 of the judgment in I.D.A. Co's case
(supra) are relevant in this behalf. This para reads as follows:
"11. If we turn to Chapter III of the MRTP Act, we find that the entire machinery is
provided for preparation, submission and sanction of development plan proceeding
from Section 21 and ending with Section 31. These provisions, in short, provide for
preparation of draft development plant by the planning authority inviting objections
of persons concerned against such proposals, hearing of objections filed by the
objectors as per Section 28 sub-section (3) by the Planning committee and then
submitting its report to the planning authority which ultimately gets the proposals
approved by the State Government under Section 30. All these provisions do indicate
that requirement, designation, reservation or earmarking of any land for acquisition

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 97Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

for any specified public purpose as indicated in the plan has already undergone the
process of hearing after the objections of the persons concerned were considered and
then such land gets earmarked for public purpose in the plan. It is after that stage,
therefore, when need to acquire such earmarked, designated or reserved land for
public purpose under the plan arises, that Section 126(1) proposal gets issued by the
planning authority concerned and which itself becomes a substitute for Section 4(1)
notification under the Act. It would thus, appear that the scheme of acquisition of
earmarked land under the plan for a specified public purpose thereunder, is a
complete scheme or code under the MRTP Act. It is a distinct and independent
scheme as compared to general scheme of acquisition under the Land Acquisition
Act."

(emphasis supplied)

91. In this connection, we must note Section 126(1) of the MRTP Act provides for
three modes of acquisition of land for public purposes specified in the plan. The third
mode is by making an application to the State Government for acquiring such land
under the L.A. Act, and thereafter the land so acquired vests absolutely in the
Planning Authority. Sections 126(1) and (2) are extracted herein below for ready
reference.

"126 - Acquisition of land required for public purposes specified in plans (1) Where
after the publication of a draft Regional Plan, a Development or any other plan or
Town Planning Scheme, any land is required or reserved for any of the public
purposes specified in any plan or scheme under this Act at any time the planning
Authority, Development Authority, or as the case may be, [any Appropriate Authority
may, expect as otherwise provided in section 113A] [acquire the land,-
(a) by agreement by paying an amount agreed to, or

(b) in lieu of any such amount, by granting the land-owner or the lessee, subject,
however, to the lessee paying the lessor or depositing with the Planning Authority,
Development Authority or Appropriate Authority, as the case may be, for payment to
the lessor, an amount equivalent to the value of the lessor's interest to be determined
by any of the said Authorities concerned on the basis of the principles laid down in
the Land Acquisition Act, 1894(I of 1894), Floor Space Index (FSI) or Transferable
Development Rights (TDR) against the area of land surrendered free of cost and free
from all encumbrances, and also further additional Floor Space Index or Transferable
Development Rights against the development or construction of the amenity on the
surrendered land at his cost, as the Final Development Control Regulations prepared
in this behalf provide, or

(c) by making an application to the State Government for acquiring such land under
the Land Acquisition Act, 1894(I of 1894),and the land (together with the amenity, if

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/

98Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

any so developed or constructed) so acquired by agreement or by grant of Floor Space
Index or additional Floor Space Index or Transferable Development Rights under
this section or under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894(I of 1890), as the case may be,
shall vest absolutely free from all encumbrances in the Planning Authority,
Development Authority, or as the case may be, any Appropriate Authority.] (2) On
receipt of such application, if the State Government is satisfied that the land specified
in the application is needed for the public purpose therein specified, or [if the State
Government (except in cases falling under section 49 [and except as provided in
section 113A)] itself is of opinion] that any land included in any such plan is needed
for any public purpose, it may make a declaration to that effect in the Official Gazette,
in the manner provided in section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894(I of 1894), in
respect of the said land. The declaration so published shall, notwithstanding anything
contained in the said Act, be deemed to be a declaration duly made under the said
section:

[Provided that, subject to the provisions of sub-section (4), no such declaration shall
be made after the expiry of one year from the date of publication of the draft Regional
Plan, Development Plan or any other Plan, or Scheme, as the case may be.] (3) ........

92. Section 128 of the MRTP Act strengthens the view that we are taking. Section 128
deals with a situation where the land is sought to be acquired for a purpose other
than the one which is designated in the plan or the scheme. In that case provisions of
the L.A. Act apply with full force. This Section reads as follows:
"128. Power of State Government to acquire lands for purpose other than the one for
which it is designated in draft plan or scheme.

(1) Where any land is included in [any plan or scheme] as being reserved, allotted or
designated for any purpose therein specified or for the purpose of Planning Authority
or Development Authority or Appropriate Authority and the State Government is
satisfied that the same land is needed for a public purpose different from any such
public purpose or purpose of the Planning Authority, Development Authority or
Appropriate Authority, the State Government may, notwithstanding anything
contained in this Act, acquire such land under the provisions of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894(I of 1894).

[(1A) Save as otherwise provided in this Act or any other law for the time being in
force where any land included in any plan or scheme as being reserved, allotted or
designated for any purpose therein specified or for the purposes of a Planning
Authority or Development Authority or Appropriate Authority, is being acquired by
the State Government under the provisions of the Maharashtra Industrial
Development Act, 1961(Mah. III of 1962), for the Maharashtra Industrial

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/

99Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Development Corporation (being the Special Planning Authority deemed to have
been appointed as such under sub-section (1A) of section 40), the provisions of
sub-sections (2) and (3) of this section shall mutatis mutandis, apply to such
acquisition proceedings. ] (2) In the proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act,
1894(I of 1894), the Planning Authority, or Development Authority or Appropriate
Authority, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be a person interested in the land
acquired; and in determining the amount of compensation to be awarded, the market
value of the land shall be assessed as if the land had been released from the
reservation, allotment or designation made in the [any plan or scheme] or new town,
as the case may be, and the Collector or the Court shall take into consideration the
damage, if any, that Planning Authority or Development Authority or Appropriate
Authority, as the case may be, may sustain by reason of acquisition of such land
under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894(I of 1894), or otherwise, and the proportionate
cost of the Development plan or town planning scheme or new town, if any, incurred
by such Authority and rendered abortive by reason of such acquisition.

(3) On the land vesting, in the State Government under sections 16 or 17 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894(I of 1894), as the case may be, the [relevant plan or scheme]
shall be deemed to be suitably varied by reason of acquisition of the said land."

Sub-section (1) of this Section states that in such situations the provision of L.A. Act
will apply notwithstanding anything contained in the MRTP Act, and sub-section (3)
specifically states that in such an event the vesting will take place under Section 16
and 17 of the L.A. Act as the case may be. That is not the case with respect to the
acquisition under Section 126 of the MRTP Act, where the vesting takes place in the
three circumstances mentioned thereunder.

In the present case also the acquisition is resorted to by issuing a notification under Section 126 read
with Section 6 of the L.A. Act. The vesting therefore takes place at that stage.

93. After the declaration is made under Section 126 (2) of the MRTP Act, the proceedings to
determine the compensation follow the procedure as laid down under the L.A. Act until Section 11
thereof. A notice is given to the interested persons as required under Section 9 of the L.A. Act to
lodge their claims to compensation for all the interests in such land. Thereafter, they are heard in
the inquiry made by the Collector or the S.L.A.O., and after following the requirements as laid down
in Section 11, the compensation is arrived at. The change of purpose of utilisation of the land
acquired under Section 126 of the Act does not make any difference in this behalf. There is no
prejudice caused to the landowners since the award is made only after affording them full hearing
concerning their claims for compensation.

94. (i) When it comes to urgency also, there is a separate provision in the MRTP Act, distinct from
the one in the L.A. Act. Section 129 of the MRTP Act contains provisions different from Section 17 of
the L.A. Act. Under sub-Section (2) of Section 129 there is the requirement of paying to the owner of
the land concerned, an interest @ 4% per annum on the amount of compensation, from the date of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 100Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

taking possession of the land until the date of payment.

(ii) Thus the MRTP Act contains a separate scheme in Chapter VII of the Act distinct from the one in
L.A. Act. This is because MRTP Act is a special act enacted for the purpose of planned development
and the provisions concerning land acquisition are made therein in that context.

95. We may mention at this stage that recently a Constitution Bench of this Court has also held in
the context of Section 11A of the L.A. Act (providing for two years period to make the award) in
Girnar Traders (3) Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. reported in 2011 (3) SCC 1, that only the
provisions with respect to the acquisition of land, payment of compensation and recourse of legal
remedies under the L.A. Act can be read into Chapter VII of the MRTP Act concerning Land
Acquisition, and Section 11A of the L.A. Act will not apply thereto. It held that in the scheme of the
MRTP Act, the provisions of Land Acquisition Act would apply only until the making of the award
under Section 11 of the Act. The Court held that MRTP Act is a self contained code and Sections 126
to 129 thereof clearly enunciate the intention of the framers that substantive provisions of L.A. Act
are not applicable to MRTP Act. In para 129 of the judgment the Constitution Bench has specifically
held:"129; sveves Vesting, unlike Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act which operates only
after the award is made and compensation is given, whereas under the MRTP Act it
may operate even at the initial stages before making of an award, for example, under
Sections 126(1)(c) and 83."

96. The appellants herein have contended, and so had the respondents in I.D.A. Co's case (supra)
contended that the original public purpose should continue till the award was made and possession
taken. While dealing with this proposition, K. Ramaswamy, J. took an overview of the leading
judgments in this behalf. The Learned Judge in arriving at his conclusions referred to the law laid
down by this Court in Ghulam Mustafa Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in 1976 (1) SCC 800,
Mangal Oram Vs. State of Orissa reported in 1977 (2) SCC 46 , State of Maharashtra Vs. Mahadeo
Deoman Rai reported in 1990 (3) SCC 579 , Collector of 24 Parganas Vs. Lalit Mohan Mullick
reported in 1986 (2) SCC 138, and Ram Lal Sethi Vs. State of Haryana reported in 1990 Supp. SCC
11.

97. It is relevant to refer to these judgments. Ghulam Mustafa (supra) & Mangal Oram (Supra) were
both cases concerning the acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act. In the case of Ghulam
Mustafa, V.R. Krishna Iyer J., observed as follows:
tees once the original acquisition is valid and title has vested in the municipality how
it uses the excess land is no concern of the original owner and cannot be the basis for
invalidating the acquisition. There is no principle of law by which a valid compulsory
acquisition stands voided because long later the requiring authority diverts it to a
public purpose other than the one stated in the Section 6(3) declaration."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 101Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

In Mangal Oram (supra) a bench of three Judges specifically held that use of land
after a valid acquisition for a different public purpose will not invalidate the
acquisition. In Collector of 24 Parganas (supra) the notification under Section 4 of
the West Bengal Land Development and Planning Act was issued for settlement and
rehabilitation of displaced persons. Subsequently the land was utilised for
establishment of a Hospital for crippled children, which was held to be not vitiated.
In Union of India Vs. Jaswant Rai Kochhar reported in 1996 (3) SCC 491 land
acquired for housing scheme was utilised for commercial purpose i.e. a District
Centre. This Court held in that matter that it is will settled law that land sought to be
acquired for one public purpose may be used for another public purpose. In State of
Maharashtra Vs. Mahadeo Deoman Rai reported in 1990 (3) SCC 579 yet another
Bench of three Judges had held that requirement of public purpose may change from
time to time but the change will not vitiate the acquisition proceeding. The opinion
rendered by K. Ramaswamy J. is in conformity with this line of judgments. Following
this law, K. Ramaswamy, J. held in para 22 as follows:
"22. It is thus well-settled legal position that the land acquired for a public purpose
may be used for another public purpose on account of change or surplus thereof. The
acquisition validly made does not become invalid by change of the user or change of
the user in the Scheme as per the approved plan........... It would not, therefore, be
necessary that the original public purpose should continue to exist till the award was
made and possession taken."

 

This being the position, there is no difficultly in stating that the two judgments of the
Bombay High Court which are relied upon by the appellants (viz. in the cases of I.D.I.
Co. (supra) and Santu Kisan Khandwe (supra) do not lay down the correct position of
law. We are in respectful agreement with the opinion rendered by K.Ramaswamy J.
in I.D.I. Co's Case. The acquisition of the land in the present case cannot said to be
invalid on account of change of purpose during acquisition.

98. That apart, there is also the question as to whether the Civil Court had the jurisdiction to
entertain a suit to challenge the acquisition after the award was rendered. This is because when it
comes to acquisition, the L.A. Act provides for the entire mechanism as to how acquisition is to be
effected, and the remedies to the aggrieved parties. In State of Bihar Vs. Dhirendra Kumar & Ors.
reported in 1995 (4) SCC 229 this Court in terms held that since the Act is a complete code, by
necessary implication the power of the Civil Court to take cognizance of a case under Section 9 of the
CPC stands excluded, and Civil Court had no jurisdiction to go into the question of the validity or
legality of the notification under Section 4 and declaration under Section 6, which could be done
only by the High Court in a proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution. In view of this dictum
the civil suit itself was not maintainable in the present case.

Conduct of the Landowner/Developer

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 102Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

99. The facts as narrated earlier can be placed into proper prospective if we note the conduct of the
landowner and the developer appointed by him as it emerges from stage to stage which is as
follows:
(a) The landowner never raised any objection when the F.P. No. 110 was sought to be reserved for a
public purpose, viz. either for a garden/playground or subsequently for a primary school.

(b) On his issuing the purchase notice to the Government to purchase the land and to commence the
proceedings for acquisition, the State Government responded by confirming the purchase notice
under Section 49 (4) of the Act by its letter dated 5.12.1979.

(c) When SLAO started the acquisitions proceedings, and when the notice under Section 9 of the
L.A. Act was issued, the landowner replied the same but did not challenge the acquisition as such.
He merely demanded compensation at a rate of Rs. 480 per sq.m, and demanded that the material
removed after demolition of the temporary structures (of the tenants) on the property be handed
over to him.

(d) After the SLAO rejected the objections of the landowner as well as the tenants, and gave his
award dated 12.5.1983, the landowner accepted the compensation on 15.3.1985, though under
protest.

(e) After the Reference Court enhanced the solatium and the special component by its order dated
15.4.1988, the landowner accepted the enhanced amount, once again under protest. However, he did
not file the statutory appeal available to him under Section 54 of the L.A. Act.

(f) When the notice to take possession was given, it is the tenants alone who filed a suit to challenge
the acquisition.

(g) After the injunction in that suit No. 966 of 1983 was vacated, the tenants represented to the
Minister of State for UDD, pointing out their difficulties. The landowner did not challenge the
acquisition in any manner whatsoever.

(h) After the Development Plan under the MRTP Act was sanctioned, though the reservation was
continued, the purpose of utilization of the land was changed in the 1987 D.P. plan from garden to
primary school. Thereafter, when the SLAO gave one more notice to take possession on 1.3.1988,
some of the tenants filed another Civil Suit bearing No. 397 of 1988 in the Court of Civil Judge,
Senior Division Pune. It was at that stage that the landowner who was a defendant in that suit,
applied for transposing himself as a plaintiff which application was allowed on 2.4.1988. The Civil
Court having held that the acquisition had lapsed due to the change of purpose of acquisition (from
what it originally was in 1966), the PMC filed an Appeal which is pending thereafter.

(i) After Shri Manohar Joshi took over as the Chief Minister on 14.3.1995, the landowner entered
into a Development agreement with M/s Vyas Constructions on 20.10.1995. Besides, he executed

two powers of attorney, one in favour of its proprietor Shri Girish Vyas on 20.10.1995 for carrying

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 103Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

out development on F.P. No. 110, and another in favour of Shri Shriram Karandikar on 26.10.1995
to take necessary steps concerning this development. Thereafter the follow-up steps were taken by
Shri Karandikar, until the last stage when Shri Girish Vyas stepped in.

(j) After the City Engineer, Pune rejected the proposal of the Architect of the landowner for building
permission by his reply dated 6.11.1995, the above referred Shri Karandikar straightaway wrote to
the Minister of State for UDD on 20.11.1995, and sought a direction to the Municipal Commissioner
to consider landowner's application for development of the property. This application was not
addressed to the State Government or to the Secretary concerned, but straightaway to the Minister
of State for UDD, and did not bear any inward stamp of the department. The noting of the Private
Secretary of the Minister of State in UDD in the margin of the application showed that it was directly
received at the Minister's level. Thereafter as directed by the Minister of State, the Under Secretary
of UDD immediately called a meeting of high ranking officers such as Secretary UDD, Director Town
Planning, Commissioner of PMC, City Engineer of PMC, and Under Secretary UDD, which meeting
would not have been possible unless one had a clout with the Ministry.

(k) The initial stand of the administration was clearly reflected in the notings, and in the record of
the meeting held on 3.2.1996. The preliminary note dated 2.2.1996 from the department clearly
stated that the land had been acquired after taking the necessary action on the purchase notice, and
the compensation had been accepted. The question of returning of the plot to the landowner
therefore did not arise.

(1) During the meeting held on 3.2.1996 the City Engineer of PMC also pointed out that landowner
had never objected to the reservation on the plot, or the change in the purpose of its utilization from
1982 to 1987, i.e. during the entire process of revising the development plan. If the proceeding
before the Minister of State was in the nature of an appeal under Section 47 of the MRTP Act
(against the rejection of the proposal of development) under Section 45, the same could not be
entertained, and the appeal had to be rejected. If it was an application for de-reservation then it had
to be considered under Section 37 of the MRTP Act and not otherwise.

(m) The landowner initially took the stand that it was not an appeal, but subsequently wrote a letter
on 23.3.1996 through Shri Karandikar that it was an appeal under Section 47 of the MRTP Act. The

landowner and the developer have been changing their stand from time to time.

The conduct of the Minister of State for UDD, the then Chief Minister, and the Municipal
Commissioner

100. We may now refer to the conduct of the then Minister of State for UDD, the then Chief Minister
and the then Municipal Commissioner.

(a) As stated above the application of the landowner was received directly at the level of the Minister
of State and immediately a meeting of high ranking officers was called, which is normally not done.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 104Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

(b) In spite of a clear initial stand taken by the City Engineer PMC, as well as by the senior officers of
UDD such as its Secretary, in view of the landowner submitting that on the adjoining plots schools
had been developed, the Minister of State for UDD asked the Municipal Commissioner to survey the
property and make a report, whether the PMC really needed the concerned property. The note of the
meeting dated 3.2.1996 shows that initially the Minister of State for UDD was also of the view that if
necessary a direction may be issued under Section 37 of the Act, and only a part of F.P. 110 could be
released if PMC did not have any objection to reduce the area under reservation.

(c) In view of the direction of the Minister of State, the Municipal Commissioner who is the Chief
Executive of PMC and an I.A.S. officer of a high rank was asked to make a report after personally
making a site inspection. A direction to a high ranking officer to make a site inspection is not
expected in such a case, and is quite unusual and disturbing to say the least.

(d) In his letter dated 17.4.1996 the Municipal Commissioner reiterated the earlier stated stand of
PMC to begin with, and then gave the report about the schools in the vicinity. However, he
volunteered to add thereafter that private institutions may not come to this plot to set up a primary
school, and PMC may as well spend its funds elsewhere. This was not correct since the applications
of two reputed educational institutions for this very plot were pending with the PMC, and this fact
was not stated by the Commissioner in his report.

(e) In view of the direction of the State Government, the Commissioner held discussions with Shri
Karandikar, who offered to give an alternate unencumbered plot of land of about 5000 to 10,000 sq.
feet free of cost. Thereafter the Commissioner recorded in his letter the two proposals given by Shri
Karandikar, and observed that if the school was to be shifted from F.P. No. 110, an action under
Section 37 of the MRTP Act as well as the permission from PMC will be required.

(f) On 24.4.1996 there is a noting (which is subsequent to the letter of the Municipal Commissioner
dated 17.4.1996) that the file was called by the then Chief Minister for his perusal. Thus the Chief
Minister had kept himself fully abreast with the developments in this matter.

(g) The UDD department did not accept the proposal of shifting the school from F.P. No. 110 to a
place far away, as seen from the note prepared by the department (signed by the Deputy Secretary
on 4.6.1996) recording that if the school was to be shifted from F.P. No. 110, it had to come up in the
vicinity of approximately 200 metres as per rule 13.5 of Pune D.C. Rules. The note suggested
acceptance of the proposal of reduction of 50% of the area under reservation by resorting to the
procedure under Section 37 of MRTP Act.

(h) The Minister of State did not approve this note dated 4.6.1996, and in view of Shri Karandikar
insisting on shifting the school from F.P. No. 110, the subsequent note dated 13.6.1996 recorded that
if the condition of 200 metres is to be relaxed, orders will have to be obtained from the Chief
Minister (which power is disputed by the Principal Secretary, UDD in his subsequent note dated
24.7.1998).

(i) Thereafter, the developer offered another parcel of land at Lohegaon (which is a far off place), on
which proposal the department prepared a note to give four directions to PMC which have been
referred earlier. Under that proposal, Lohegaon land was to be exchanged for the concerned F.P. No.
110 which was to be released by invoking DC Rule 13.5, and the landowner was to return to PMC the
amount of compensation received. This note was approved by the Chief Minister on 21.8.1996 and
accordingly a direction was given to the Municipal Commissioner on 3.9.1996 to accept the proposal
of the developer and issue the development permission for F.P. No. 110.

(j) The Senior Law Officer of the PMC recorded an objection that such permission will require the
approval of the general body of the Municipal Corporation, but the Municipal Commissioner
overruled him on 21.9.1996, in view of the direction of the government to act under DC Rule 13.5 as
stated above, and ignored the mandatory provision of Section 37 of MRTP Act.

(k) Thereafter the commencement certificates have been issued on 28.11.1996, and an occupation
certificate for the tenants’ building was also given on 20.12.1997.

(1) At this stage, the land developer Shri Girish Vyas had written on 15.7.1998 to PMC on learning
that according to PMC the Lohegaon land was not suitable for a school. He offered to handover
another parcel of land in a residential zone at Mundhwa (which is also a far off place), and to deposit
whatever amount that was required for the construction of a school of 500 sq. feet area at Mundhwa
or elsewhere, but the Completion Certificate for the building for the other occupants of F.P. No. 110
(named as Sun-Dew Apartment) be issued.

(m) There is a clear office note dated 22.7.1998 on record which shows that there was already a
criticism of this matter in the newspapers and in the General Body of PMC, that one educational
amenity in that area was being destroyed. The note recorded that Sr. Chief Secretary of Chief
Minister had issued instructions, to put up a self-explanatory note for the perusal of the Chief
Minister, to enable him to answer the probable questions in the assembly. This note dated 22.7.1998
was specifically marked for the Chief Minister.

(n) The Principal Secretary UDD had opined on 24.7.1998 that resort to DC Rule 13.5 will not be
legal, and an action be taken under Section 37 of MRTP Act. Yet, in view of the favourable indication
of the Municipal Commissioner in his letter dated 17.4.1996, a note was prepared on 27.7.1998 to
continue to maintain the decision under DC Rule 13.5.

(o) When Shri Girish Vyas had entered into the picture through his above referred letter, the
Additional Chief Secretary made a note that since the developer is related to the Chief Minister, the
Minister of State may take proper decision as per the rules. It is only because of this note that the
Minister of State had signed the papers approving the proposal of the department, and directing
that the necessary orders be issued to the PMC. Accordingly, the Deputy Secretary of UDD issued
the consequent letter dated 29.7.1998 to the Municipal Commissioner, permitting him to accept the
land at Mundhwa or elsewhere, as well as the amount to construct a school building of 500 sq. feet,
and to issue the occupancy certificate for the Sundew Apartments.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 106Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

(p) Thus it has got to be inferred that not only the then Chief Minister was fully aware about this
matter right from April 1996, until the last direction of UDD dated 29.7.1998, but was associated
with the decision making process and the directions issued all throughout.

101. The events in this matter disclose that although the officers of UDD and the PMC initially took
the clear stand opposing the proposal on behalf of the landowner to put up a residential building in
place of a Primary School, the Minister of State for Urban Development asked the Municipal
Commissioner to personally carry out a survey of the property, on the ground that two schools had
come up in the near vicinity, ignoring the fact that they had so come up as per the provision in the
D.P. Plan itself. Thereafter when it was pointed out that the permission of the general body of the
Municipal Corporation will be required for the modification, that submission was by-passed. The
provision of DC Rule 13.5 requiring alternate land to be provided for the same purpose within 200
meters was also given a go-bye, and this rule was utilized to accept the proposal to shift the school to
a very far off place. The mandatory provision for modification under Section 37 of the MRTP Act
was totally ignored. Ultimately only an amount for constructing a school building elsewhere and the
land therefor was offered to the Municipal Corporation, for getting a reserved plot of land in a prime
area of the city released from a public amenity. Last but not the least, the Municipal Corporation
was instructed to withdraw the First Appeal which it had filed to challenge the decision of the
District Court in favour of the landowner in the matter of acquisition.

102. It is material to note that after the Municipal Commissioner sent his report dated 17.4.1996, the
Private Secretary to the then Chief Minister Shri Manohar Joshi had called for the file for his
perusal. After all necessary directions were decided, the Chief Minister placed on record his
approval on 21.8.1996 with an apparently innocent remark “All actions be taken in accordance with
law', though he did not forget to record "No objection". Thus, the decision of the Government dated
3.9.1996 to shift the reservation of a primary school from F.P. 110 under D.C. Rule 13.5 was under
his order dated 21.8.1996. Subsequently, when his son-in-law Shri Girish Vyas wrote the letter dated
15.7.1998 that money be received for constructing a school somewhere else, it became obvious on
the record that the son-in-law of the then Chief Minister was behind the project. At that stage also
the Chief Minister had to be pointed out by the Addl. Chief Secretary that the developer is related to
him, and therefore, the necessary decision may not be taken by him, but by the Minister of State.
Therefore, the file went to the Minister of State for UDD on whose direction the last necessary letter
has been sent to PMC by the Deputy Secretary UDD on 29.7.1998. However this subsequent
decision is in continuation to the initial decision of the Chief Minister dated 21.8.1996, and therefore
the responsibility for the clearance of this disputed construction squarely lies on his shoulders.

A brief summary

103. This is not a case where the landowner or his developer have approached the appropriate
authority on the basis of their allegedly subsisting rights under the erstwhile T.P. scheme
contending that setting up of a primary school on that plot contrary thereto would be affecting their
right to develop the property and is therefore illegal. It is also not a case where they have
approached the appropriate authority pointing out that there are sufficient number of schools in the
near vicinity with supporting information and, therefore, sought deletion of reservation on the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 107Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

concerned plot. This is a case where the landowner never raised either of the two pleas to begin with.
He was conscious of the fact that the land was reserved for a public garden in the 1966 D.P. Plan
and, therefore, gave a purchase notice in May, 1979 which was confirmed by the State Government
in December, 1979. When the D.P. Plan was revised during 1982-1987, he never raised any of the
above two submissions. He did not even challenge the subsequent reservation for a primary school
finalized in 1987. Only in 1995 when Shri Manohar Joshi became the Chief Minister, he appointed
his son-in-law as a developer and another power of attorney Shri Karandikar to approach the
Ministers directly. He pointed out that two schools had come up on the adjoining plots (which was
in fact as per the D.P. Plan itself), and the Minister used this information to get a report from the
Municipal Commissioner who suppressed the fact that applications for this very plot from two
educational institutions were pending with PMC. Then also the order of deletion was not passed
either under Section 37 (leave aside Section 22A), or Section 50 of the Act which was invoked for the
first time in this Court (and which otherwise also could not be applied). The order of deletion was
passed under D.C. Rule 13.5 which had no application.

104. The effect of what has been done is this: that a landowner accepts compensation for his land
when acquisition proceedings are initiated at his instance. The landowner does not challenge either
the acquisition proceedings or the amount of compensation, but in fact collects the amount. When
the tenants challenge the acquisition, the land owner joins the same subsequently. When the award
is set aside by the civil court, and the Municipal Corporation files the appeal, the landowner
approaches a close relative of the Chief Minister, who happens to be a property developer. The
development permission is granted by-passing the objections of the concerned department of the
Government and the Municipal Corporation, and flouting all relevant provisions of law. The
Municipal Corporation is asked to withdraw the appeal against the judgment holding that
acquisition has lapsed. When the actions are challenged in a public interest litigation, the landowner
contends that he had a subsisting right under the erstwhile T.P. Scheme, in spite of a subsequent
reservation for a public amenity in the D.P. Plan holding the field, and that the construction is
permissible though its legality cannot be traced to any provision of law.

105. Present case is not one where permission was sought for the construction under erstwhile T.P.
scheme, or under Section 50 of the MRTP Act. This is a case where the personal relationship of the
developer with the Chief Minister was apparently used to obtain permission for construction
without following any due process of law. This is a case of rules and procedures being circumvented
to benefit a close relative of the Chief Minister. It is a clear case of mala fide exercise of the powers
and, therefore, the High Court was perfectly justified in canceling the development permission
which was granted by the State Government. The development permission could not be defended
either under Rule 6.6.2.2 or under Section 50. The MRTP Act requires a valid development
permission under chapter IV of the act, and in the instant case there is none. Consequently, the
construction put up on the basis of such permission had to be held to be illegal. In the
circumstances, we uphold the judgment of the Division Bench as fully justified in law and in the
facts of the case.

Impugned Order passed by the Division Bench

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 108Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

106. (i) As seen above, the Division Bench in the impugned judgment came to the conclusion that
the disputed construction by the developer was totally illegal, and also concluded that there was
nothing wrong with the acquisition of F.P. No.110. Having held so, it passed the impugned order
which can be split into two parts. The first part of the order is arising out of the determination
concerning the legality of the construction, and it can be seen in sub-paragraphs

(a) to (d) of para 227 of the judgment. The order pertaining to costs is connected with this part and
it is in sub-paragraph (f). The second part of the order is regarding appropriate criminal
investigation which is in sub-paragraph

(e).
(ii) In the first part of its order the Division Bench directed:
(a) the cancellation of the commencement certificate dated 20.8.1996, 3.5.1997 and
3.7.1998, and occupation certificate dated 20.12.1997,

(b) the PMC and its Commissioner to call upon the landowner and the developer to
restore F.P. No.110 to the position prior to the date of the earliest of the
commencement certificates, failing which these authorities will take action to
demolish the disputed construction, and collect the cost of such action from the
landowner and the developer,

(c) the PMC to move an application for restoration of First Appeal (stamp no.18615 of
1994), and

(d) rejected the prayer to revive first appeal without the demolition of the structure.

(f) the Division Bench directed payment of cost of Rs. 10,000/- each by the State of
Maharashtra, the PMC, the then Chief Minister, the then Minister of State, the
developer and the Municipal Commissioner to the petitioners.

107. In view of the gross illegality in the order of the State Government and PMC in granting the
development permission, the direction (a) for cancellation of Commencement Certificates and
Occupation Certificate had to be issued and the same can not be faulted. As far as the direction (c) is
concerned, it was noted by the High Court that the PMC had been forced by the State Government to
apply for withdrawal of its First Appeal so that the judgment of the Civil Court remains undisturbed.
Since the High Court came to the conclusion that there were nothing illegal about the acquisition,
the First Appeal had to be restored. The direction is therefore fully justified. We may note that PMC
has already filed an application for restoration of the First Appeal.

Direction to demolish the disputed building, and rejection of the objection based on alleged delay
and laches

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 109Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

108. The direction (b) in the impugned order was issued basically on two grounds. Firstly, the
development permission had no legal validity whatsoever, and secondly it was clearly a case of
showing favouritism by going out of the way and circumventing the law. Besides, since the challenge
to acquisition was being rejected, it would not have been proper to postpone the demolition of the
disputed construction on the ground of pendency of the First Appeal, since the construction was
absolutely illegal. Hence, the High Court issued direction (d) as above.

109. The demolition was objected to by the appellants amongst others on the ground that there was
delay and laches in moving the petitions to the High Court. It was submitted that if the petitioners
were vigilant, they could have seen the building coming up from November 1996 onwards, but the
petitions have been filed only in August 1998. According to them by the time the petitions were filed,
the tenants' wing was complete, and even the other wing of Sundew Apartments was nearing
completion The Division Bench has rejected this submission in paragraph 220 of its judgment by
observing that merely because a construction is coming up, a citizen cannot assume that it is illegal
or that the developer had obtained the construction permission in a manner contrary to law.
Besides, when the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 4434 of 1998 (who is a Corporator) sought the
information about the construction, he was informed by PMC that the same could not be made
available under the relevant rules, though no such rules were shown to the Division Bench. The High
Court has on the other hand noted that as a matter of fact even the construction of the building
meant for the tenants was actually said to have commenced in March 1997 only. Hence, in the facts
of the present case it could not be said that the writ petitions suffered on account of delay or laches,
and therefore the High Court was right in rejecting that contention.

110. With respect to the direction for demolition, we may note that similar direction was given way
back in the case of Pratibha Cooperative Housing Society Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in 1991
(3) SCC 341. The appellant society situated in a prime area in Mumbai had added eight upper floors
in excess of the F.S.I. permissible, and the Municipal Corporation directed removal of those floors.
The petitioner society challenged the order of the Municipal Corporation. A Division Bench of the
Bombay High Court dismissed the Writ Petition, but permitted the society to give proposals to
reduce the area of construction upto the permissible limit. During the pendency of the appeal from
the judgment of the High Court, the proposal of the society was examined by the Municipal
Corporation and was found unacceptable. While dismissing the appeal, this Court noted in the
aforesaid judgment that ‘the tendency of raising unlawful construction by the builders in violation
of the rules and regulations of the Corporation was rampant’ in the city of Mumbai. Thereafter it
observed in para 6 of the judgment:
"We are also of the view that the tendency of raising unlawful construction and
unauthorised encroachments is increasing in the entire country and such activities
are required to be dealt with by firm hands.

Having noted so it upheld the demolition of the upper eight floors and further observed in the last
para of the judgment * "Before parting with the case we would like to observe that this case should
be a pointer to all the builders that making of unauthorised constructions never pays and is against
the interest of the society."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 110Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

111. The observations of the Court however, have had no effect. In M.I Builders Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Radhey
Shyam Sahu & Ors. reported in 1999 (6) SCC 464, the issue was with respect to the retention of a
public amenity viz. a park in a congested area of city of Lucknow. The park was of historical
importance and also an environmental necessity. The Lucknow Mahapalika had permitted the
appellant builder to put up a shopping complex and a parking facility thereon. The appellant was
permitted to do so without calling any bids and for hardly any monetary gain to the Municipal
Corporation. This was also a case where the construction was on the basis of an agreement with the
builder which agreement amounted to a fraud on the powers of the Mahapalika, and a clear case of
favouritism, as in the present case. This Court dismissed the appeal and directed the demolition of
the disputed construction and observed as follows in para 73 of its judgment:
ye This Court in numerous decisions has held that no consideration should be
shown to the builder or any other person where construction is unauthorised. This
dicta is now almost bordering the rule of law. Stress was laid by the appellant and the
prospective allottees of the shops to exercise judicial discretion in moulding the relief.
Such a discretion cannot be exercised which encourages illegality or perpetuates an
illegality. Unauthorised construction, if it is illegal and cannot be compounded, has to
be demolished. There is no way out. Judicial discretion cannot be guided by
expediency. Courts are not free from statutory fetters. Justice is to be rendered in
accordance with law......"

(emphasis supplied)

112. In the present case, one would have thought of retaining the building and
utilising it for a school. The PMC had shown its willingness to consider such a
proposal. But the developer wanted to retain half of the flats of this ten storey
building which would have been contrary to the provision in the Development Plan,
and hence the proposal fell through. That apart, such a compounding would have
been contrary to the above dicta in M.I Builders case (supra). There is no redeeming
feature whatsoever in the present case. It is clearly a case of misuse of one's position
for the benefit of a relative leading to an action which is nothing short of fraud on
one's power and also on the statute.

There is no reason for us to interfere in the order passed by the High Court directing the demolition
of the disputed buildings.

113. The building constructed for the tenants is meant for accommodating them, and it has been
stated on behalf of the developer that he is not interested in dis-housing them. The learned senior
counsel for PMC Shri R.P. Bhat has also stated on instructions, that PMC has no objection to the
retention of the building constructed for the erstwhile occupants of the plot, however these
occupants will now have to continue in that building as tenants of PMC. As far as these occupants
are concerned, their status at the highest was that of tenants of the landowner. They claim to have
been residing on this plot for over fifty years, and appear to be belonging to economically weaker
section of the society. Their only request during the acquisition proceedings was that they should be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 111Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

accommodated on this very plot of land. It is another matter that in the High Court and in this Court
they supported the landowner and the developer, in view of the promise given to them that in the
event the landowner and the developer succeed, the tenants will get ownership rights. Now that the
plea of the landowner and the developer is rejected, the best that can happen to these occupants is to
get the tenancy rights on this very plot of land. That apart, in view of their long stay on this plot, they
had to be rehabilitated. The offer of PMC to accommodate them on the very plot of land is more
than fair, and deserves acceptance. Since, the tenants were already in possession of a part of the plot
for residential purpose, they are being continued to remain on that plot for that very purpose. In
that event, the tenants may not be entitled to receive any monetary compensation since this offer is
as per their original demand and it very much compensates them. However, since the amount of
compensation awarded to them was too meagre, if they have collected it, they need not return the
same to PMC. This being the position, in our view, the main operative order passed by the High
Court needs to be modified appropriately. In the circumstances, we modify and restrict the operative
order of demolition only to the extent it directs the removal / demolition of the building meant for
the persons other than these tenants (i.e. the ten storey building named as Sundew Apartments).

114. We may as well mention at this stage that as far as this building viz. Sundew Apartments is
concerned, no one, except a bank had come forward to claim any third party rights, or prejudice on
account of the order of demolition passed by the High Court in spite of the well publicised litigation
of this matter. The concerned bank had advanced a loan to the developer against the security of two
flats in that building, and it intervened only at the last stage of passing of the order. The Division
Bench has rightly rejected the claim of the bank in paragraphs 224 to 226 of its judgment by
observing that the court could not accept the contention of the bank that it was not aware of the
illegality on the part of the developer. The court did not accept the bank's plea of innocently
advancing the money, since the mortgage was executed on 13.8.1998, whereas the allegations
concerning the illegality of this transaction had appeared in the newspapers right from March 1998.
The bank should have considered the matter in depth before advancing the loan. In any case the
demolition will only extinguish its security though its claim against the developer may remain.

Adverse remarks, and the direction for criminal investigation

115. The second part of the operative order in the impugned judgment was based on the adverse
inferences drawn by the Division Bench against the then Chief Minister, the Minister of State and
the Municipal Commissioner. The petitioners had infact sought a prosecution against all of them.
However, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case the court was not inclined to
grant that relief, without appropriate prior investigation. Therefore, with respect to this prayer the
Court passed an order which is contained in paragraph 227 (e) in two parts as follows:

(i) to direct the State of Maharashtra to make appropriate investigation against the then Chief
Minister, the Minister of State and the Municipal Commissioner by an impartial agency, and

(ii) if satisfied that any criminal offences have been committed by the aforesaid respondents in the
discharge of their duties, to take such action as is warranted in law.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 112Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

These three appellants have therefore made two fold prayers viz. expunging the adverse
observations, and setting aside the direction for appropriate investigation to be followed by such
action as is warranted in law.

Adverse remarks by the Division Bench against the Municipal Commissioner, Minister of State and
the then Chief Minister:- Adverse remarks against the Municipal Commissioner

116. Apart from other allegations, it has been specifically alleged in Writ Petition 4434 of 1998 that
the then Municipal Commissioner "wilted under the pressure of the Chief Minister.....", "acted in
flagrant disregard to the provisions of the law", and "with a view to favour his son-in-law Shri Girish
Vyas acted illegally and mala fide". As we have seen from the notings on the file, initially he did take
a stand which could be said to be as per the record, and in consonance with law. In his affidavit
before the High Court, he took the stand that he acted under the directions of the Minister, and
hence, he should not be blamed for the ultimate decision. Shri Narshima, learned senior counsel
appearing for him drew our attention to the Maharashtra Government Rules of Business framed
under Article 166 of the Constitution in this behalf. He also tried to defend the Commissioner's
action by invoking Section 154 of the MRTP Act which lays down amongst others that the Planning
Authority has to carry out the directions and instructions of the State Government for the efficient
administration of the act. The Division Bench declined to accept this explanation. We have already
dealt with this submission and recorded our reasons as to why we also cannot accept this reliance on
Section 154.

117. (i) It was submitted on behalf of the Commissioner that he brought the correct legal position to
the notice of the Minister of State to begin with, but ultimately had to give up due to the instructions
from the Minister of State, meaning thereby that he cannot be blamed since he was acting under the
directions of his superiors. Reliance was placed in this behalf on the proposition in paragraph 16 of
Tarlochan Das Vs. State of Punjab & Ors reported in 2001 (6) SCC 260 to the following effect:
"No government servant shall in the performance of his official duties, or in the
exercise of power conferred on him, act otherwise than in his best judgment except
when he is acting under the direction of his official superior."

(ii) This defence cannot help him much if we see his actions atleast on two occasions. Firstly, when
he made his report dated 17.4.1996 to the Minister of State, he overlooked the fact that the
reservation on this plot was for a primary school, and not merely for a municipal primary school. As
has been noted by the Division Bench, two private schools had already come up on the adjoining
plots as per the D.P. provision itself. Besides, two renowned educational institutions had applied
way back for this plot of land for running of schools thereon. The Commissioner did not place this
very vital information before the Minister of State in his report. On the other hand he stated that
Prabhat Road being a higher middle class area, a municipal school may not get adequate students.
The Division Bench has therefore, observed in paragraph 143 of its judgment, that his report was
"far from truth". Secondly, he bypassed the general body of the Municipal Corporation in the matter
of deleting the reservation on F.P. No. 110 inspite of being aware of the correct legal position, and
his attention having been specifically drawn thereto by the senior law officer of PMC.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 113Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

118. Both these acts on the part of the Municipal Commissioner clearly amounted to failure on his
part to discharge his duty correctly for which he cannot blame anybody else. This is the least that is
got to be stated about his conduct by this Court. The Division Bench has commented that he acted
"as a loyal soldier perhaps more loyal to the king than king himself", which was "with a view to
please his bosses". It is true that in the first meeting called by the Minister of State for UDD, it was
pointed out on behalf of PMC that the land had been acquired. The Commissioner had also pointed
out that if the reservation was to be reduced or to be deleted, the permission of the Municipal
Corporation will have to be obtained. His report of 17.4.1996, cannot however be said to be fully
satisfactory and he failed in his duty when he permitted the by-passing of the Municipal Corporation
in the matter of deletion of reservation on F.P. No.110, which he claims to have done in view of the
direction from the Chief Minister under the D.C. Rules. We can say that a high ranking IAS Officer
was expected to show his mettle, and he failed to come up to the expectations, but noticing that he
had no personal interest in the matter, and he was acting under the directions of his superior, the
Division Bench could have avoided making the particular remarks against him.

The conduct of the Minister of State

119. In paragraph 3 of Writ Petition 4434 of 1998, there is a specific allegation against the then
Minister of State as well as the then Chief Minister of "the blatant misuse of executive powers", "with
a sole objective of ensuring a substantial monetary benefit for M/s Vyas Constructions. The defence
of the Minister of State was that he tried to find out a workable solution, and acted on the advice of
the officers of his department. As we have seen from the notings and as observed by the Division
Bench that initially the Minister of State was also of the view that Section 37 of the MRTP Act should
be followed. In this connection, it is relevant to note that after receiving the letter dated 17.4.1996
from the Municipal Commissioner, the UDD department prepared its note in which it specifically
recommended that only half the area of the concerned plot be released to the landowner, and that he
should accommodate the tenants in his development of the property on that portion of land, and an
action under Section 37 be taken for that purpose. Thus, the departmental note was in fact as per the
initial stand taken by the Minister of State, yet strangely enough, he declined to approve the note.
He contended in his affidavit before the High Court that he was persuaded to accept the suggestion
to act under the D.C. Rule 13.5 under which a similar action had been taken in Kothrud, Pune. No
particulars of that Kothrud precedent were however, placed before the Court.

120. The Minister of State also tried to contend that until the last he had no knowledge of Shri
Murudkar's connection with the son-in-law of Chief Minister. In view of the facts which have
emerged on the record, it was just not possible to accept this contention. The Division Bench has
given its reasons for the same and has commented on his conduct as follows at the end of paragraph
140:
" eae It is difficult to account for the anxiety of the Minister of State, UDD, to find out
some solution to either reduce the area of reservation or shift it to a new place. Only
tenable explanation is that it was a design to ensure that the representation made by
Murudkar on November 20, 1995 was allowed. It is not being suggested by any one
that respondent No.6 was personally interested in the proposal or that he had any

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 114Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

particular interest in seeing that this proposal was sanctioned. We, therefore, have to
fall back on the inference that respondent No.6 was under pressure from respondent
No.5."

121. In this behalf it is relevant to note the conduct of the Minister of State from stage to stage.

(i) Firstly, he entertained the application of Shri Karandikar directly at his own level, and thereafter
immediately called a meeting of high ranking officers to take a decision thereon. Would such other
applications receive such a direct and expeditious attention?

(ii) Secondly, he directed the Municipal Commissioner, a very high ranking officer, to carry out a
personal inspection and to make a report. Would he issue such directions in the case of other similar
applications?

(iii) Thirdly, after the Commissioner's report, the UDD department supported the initial view of the
Minister of State that only a part of F.P.No. 110 be released, and that too under Section 37. Why did
he not approve that note?

(iv) He acted as if he was waiting for the Commissioner to state that two schools had come up in the
adjoining plots, so that he can release F.P. No. 110 from the reservation for a Primary school. Did he
not realise that those schools had come up as per the Development plan itself?

(v) He relied upon an alleged precedent of release of the land at Kothrud under D.C. Rule 13.5
without having the particulars thereof on record.

(vi) He tried to put the blame on the Municipal Commissioner and the Municipal Officers for the
decision arrived at. It is true that the Commissioner failed in his duties to place full facts on record.
At the same time the fact that the Minister of State ignored the initial notes of his own department
and of PMC, which were in accordance with law, and went on acting and instructing as per the
suggestions of Shri Karandikar, which led to the convenient reports cannot be lost sight of. He acted
clearly against the provisions of law though he was fully informed about the same. Would he have
acted in such a manner on any other similar application?

(vii) Would he not be aware that the file was called by the Chief Minister after receiving the report
from the Municipal Commissioner, and for what purpose? The natural inference which flows from
all this conduct is that right from the beginning, the Minister of State was aware about Shri
Murudkar's connection with the son-in-law of Chief Minister, and therefore he acted for the benefit
of the developer, obviously at the instance of the then Chief Minister as inferred by the Division
Bench. We have no reason to disagree.

Observations against the Chief Minister

122. (i) The two Writ Petitions contain serious allegations against the then Chief Minister at various
places. Thus in paragraph 2 of the Writ Petition 4433 of 1998, it is alleged that the then Chief

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 115Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

Minister misused his executive powers and authority for the purpose of securing benefits for his
near relatives, and in paragraph 3 it is specifically stated that this was for ensuring a substantial
monetary benefit for M/s Vyas Constructions. A specific averment in paragraph 2 in this behalf is as
follows:
"It is the claim of the petitioner that on account of this close relationship, the
executive powers vested in the State of Maharashtra have either been misused and/or
actions which cannot be taken in exercise of the executive powers under the Act are
presumably take in purported exercise of such executive powers with a full knowledge
that the actions are illegal and ultra vires the provisions of the Act."

(ii) As we have noted earlier, on 24.4.1996 the initial report made by the Municipal Commissioner
dated 17.4.1996 was called for the perusal of the then Chief Minister. The basic order dated
21.8.1996 granting no objection, thereby approval to the release of the reservation on F.P. No. 110
was that of the then Chief Minister. The disputed permission dated 3.9.1996 was issued in
pursuance thereto. There is a note dated 22.7.1998 on record which was meant for the perusal of the
then Chief Minister to enable him to answer the probable questions concerning this matter in the
assembly. The last order proposed at the Government level was also brought to his notice, and he
was going to sign it, but for the advice of the Additional Chief Secretary that since his son-in-law had
written a letter by that time to the Commissioner, the papers be sent for the signature of the
Minister of State. Thus it is quite clear that he was aware about the developments in the matter, and
the orders therein were issued with his approval and knowledge. He cannot therefore, escape the
responsibility for all the illegal actions in this matter.

(iii) The learned senior counsel for the then Chief Minister Shri Shyam Diwan objected to the
language used in paragraphs 111 and 131 of the judgment which accused him of "pettifogging or
obfuscation of facts". It is stated in the judgment that the then Chief Minister "furtively" sought a
copy of the report dated 17.4.1996 on the basis of the file note dated 24.4.1996 prepared by his
private secretary to the Minister of State for Urban Development calling for the file for the then
Chief Minister's perusal. It was submitted that there was no need for the then Chief Minister to act
secretively. In our view, there is no use in taking umbrage behind the language used by the Court.
The question is whether the inference that the Chief Minister had called for the file for his perusal
can be disputed. A private secretary will not make such a note unless the file is required by the Chief
Minister. In our view the inference was fully justified. It was also sought to be contended that the
petitions were politically motivated and one of the petitioners did not have clean antecedents. We
are concerned in the present case with respect to serious allegations against the then Chief Minister
misusing his office for the benefit of his son-in-law and in that process destroying a public amenity
in the nature of a primary school. Such submissions cannot take away the seriousness of the charge,
and the Chief Minister must squarely explain and justify his actions.

123. (i) With respect to the Chief Minister calling the file for his perusal, the Division Bench has
posed a question as to whether it was an idle curiosity. "Why were the Chief Minister and the
Minister of State interested in one particular case? What momentous public policy decision was
sought to be taken in this matter?" Shri Murudkar was not someone for whom the administration

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 116Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

could have moved so fast. It was very clear that the Chief Minister was very much interested in
knowing the progress of the case all throughout. The obvious inference was that the then Chief
Minister and the Minister of State took keen interest in the matter only because Shri Murudkar had
appointed the son-in-law of the Chief Minister as his developer.

(ii) The Division Bench has dealt with the affidavit of the then Chief Minister, some of the relevant
events in this behalf and then held that the conduct of the then Chief Minister definitely leads to the
conclusion that he was very much interested in knowing the progress of the case pertaining to F.P.
No.110, and he wanted to apprise himself of report dated 17.4.1996 made by the Commissioner of
PMC. Therefore, the Division Bench held at the end of para 131 as follows:
"We are afraid, unless the Court is naove and its credulousness is stretched to the
extreme, the inference has to be that, not only was there an attempt on the part of
respondent No.5 to ‘concern’ himself with the file even prior to August 1996, but also
that respondent No.5 had taken an active interest in the case."

124. (i) Then we come to the merits of the disputed permission dated 3.9.1996 which was in
pursuance to the order of the Chief Minister dated 21.8.1996 viz. "All actions be taken in accordance
with law. No objection". It was sought to be contended on his behalf that he had clearly stated that
all actions be taken in accordance with law. But we cannot ignore that he had simultaneously stated
in his remarks of approval, "no objection" to the note containing the proposal which had been put
up before him, and which was not in accordance with law. The note clearly stated that the
reservation on the land at Lohegaon be shifted from agricultural zone to residential zone by
following the procedure under Section 37 of the MRTP Act. But as far as shifting of reservation from
F.P. No. 110 was concerned, a different yardstick, namely that of D.C. Rule 13.5 was applied for
which there was no explanation whatsoever. Thus he gave no objection to an illegal proposal as
proposed in the note, and directed that all actions be taken in accordance with law which will only
mean that the proposal be somehow fitted in four corners of law.

(ii) The letter dated 17.4.1996 from the Municipal Commissioner had already been forwarded for his
perusal. This report had clearly stated to begin with that the departmental permission had been
rejected because the property was under reservation. The report of the Municipal Commissioner
also stated that in case the change was proposed in the use of the property, permission had to be
taken from the Pune Municipal Corporation. Could not the Chief Minister understand that D.C. Rule
13.5 could not be applied to F.P. No.110 in the manner in which it was suggested? Could he not
understand that the permission of Municipal Corporation was required as per the law? In the teeth
of these legal provisions he gave no objection to the proposal to shift the reservation of F.P. No. 110
under D.C. Rule 13.5, and to shift the reservation of the plot at Lohegaon under D.C. Rule 37. In
between there is a noting of 22.7.1998 which recorded that the Chief Minister had to be briefed
about this matter appropriately for him to answer the questions in the legislative assembly. The note
has also recorded that there was a criticism about this matter in the local newspaper. Subsequently,
thereafter when the land at Mundhwa or elsewhere was sought to be exchanged in place of
Lohegaon, the letter of Shri Girish Vyas was already on the file of the PMC and the Government. Still
he was going to sign note of approval but for the advice of the Additional Chief Secretary. This shows

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 117Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the keen interest of the then Chief Minister in the matter and it can certainly be inferred that he was
so acting for the benefit of his son-in-law.

125. According to Shri Naphade, the learned counsel appearing for the developer, the inference of
mala fides is misconceived, as it is contrary to the material on record. He submitted that the
Municipal Commissioner's report dated 17.4.1996 was not found to be untrue or false by any
authority. He emphasized that as per the report (i) There are about 36 structures on the land which
are occupied by tenants; (ii) Half the area of the plot is encumbered; (iii) There are two educational
institutions in the vicinity of the plot and 11 educational institutions in the area; (iv) The acquisition
of the plot has been declared illegal by the Court; (v) The locality in question is inhabited by higher
middle class people and there may not be an appropriate response to a Primary School; (vi)
Considering the funds available the Pune Municipal Corporation is inclined to develop school on
some other plot reserved for school. He defended the decision of the then State Government and the
actions taken in pursuance thereof by submitting that (i) There is no detriment to Public Interest, as
no Municipal Primary School was required in the locality. (ii) The Appellant made alternative plot
available at his own cost in the locality where a Municipal Primary School was required. (iii) The
developer paid a sum of Rs. 25 lakhs to the PMC for construction of Municipal Primary School
wherever it wanted to put it up. (iv) Tenants occupying dilapidated structures were rehabilitated on
the very plot and were to get the ownership right free of cost.

126. These arguments are based on an erroneous premise that the plot was reserved for a Municipal
Primary school. It was reserved for a Primary school and not merely a Municipal Primary school. It
is on this false premise that the Commissioner had opined that this being a higher middle class area,
a Municipal Primary school may not get an appropriate response. The two adjoining plots were also
reserved for Primary schools as per the D.P. plan, and thereon two private schools had already come
up. That cannot be a ground to say that this plot be released from reservation. The Municipal
Commissioner had failed to place on record a very material information that one renowned
educational institution had sought this very plot for educational activities way back in 1986. The
Municipal Commissioner had not specified as to what he meant by the particular area when he
stated that eleven educational institutions had come up therein. The plot had been reserved for a
Primary school after an elaborate planning process wherein the requirements of the particular area
are appropriately considered. This is not the first case where there would be three adjoining plots
reserved for Primary schools. There are many such schools and educational complexes which always
require adjoining plots and are developed accordingly. The submission that the acquisition had been
declared illegal by the Court was also a very convenient submission ignoring that the Municipal
Appeal therefrom was pending in the High Court. There was no reason for the Corporation to be
deterred by the encumbrances on the plot, since the compensation therefor had already been arrived
at as per the law, and it did not cast much burden on the Corporation. The report of the Municipal
Commissioner was clearly made "to please the bosses" as observed by the Division Bench, and could
not be accepted as the basis for a valid legal action. The acceptance of the offer of the developer
would mean that whenever anybody wants to delete a reservation of a public amenity in a prime
area, he can throw the money to the Municipal Corporation and say that let the amenity come up
elsewhere, but the reservation be deleted. Such an approach will mean destruction of the entire
planning process and deserves to be rejected. None of these arguments can whitewash the material

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 118Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

on the record which clearly leads to the inference, that the impugned actions were motivated to
benefit the son-in-law of then Chief Minister.

127. (i) The learned counsel for the then Chief Minister objected to the inference drawn by the
Division Bench that the then Chief Minister had pressurized the officers into taking an illegal action.
It was submitted that the notings on the file indicated that there were deliberations on issues
involved in the matter at the government level on a number of occasions. The course of action
suggested in the PMC note dated 26.7.1996 was approved at several levels of authority before the
same coming to the then Chief Minister. The Deputy Secretary in the UDD Shri Vidyadhar Despande
has also stated in his affidavit that there was no pressure from the office of the Chief Minister or for
himself. That apart there were cogent factors explaining why there was no need for yet another
primary school in the locality and generally the thinking was that public interest would gain from
the proposed course of action.

(ii) As far as this latter submission about there being no need of one more primary school, one may
immediately note the scant respect that the then Chief Minister had for the cause of education and
the method of planning. One fails to see as to what public interest was going to be achieved by
preventing a primary school from coming up on a designated plot. There is no use stating that
instead a primary school will come up in another area. It will of course come up in that area if it is so
required. But there is no need to tinker with a school in another area, provided by a proper planning
process.

(iii) We have already noted the manner in which the matter had been handled. The application of
the developer was entertained directly at the level of the Minister of State. Immediately a meeting of
high ranking officers was called. Inspite of a clear stand taken by the offices of UDD as well as by
PMC, the Minister of State asked the Commissioner, a high ranking officer to make a personal site
inspection and then a report, only because the developer submitted that two schools had come up on
the adjoining plots. Was it not clear to the Minister of State that those two schools had come up as
per the provisions of the D.P. plan? The Municipal Commissioner in his report, and thereafter the
officers of the UDD, initially submitted that if deletion of reservation was to be resorted, the action
will have to be initiated under Section 37 of the Act. It is only because of the insistence of the
developer that the resort to D.C. Rule 13.5 was adopted. During the course of all these developments
the file had been called by the Secretary to the Chief Minister. Were these not clear signals to the
officers as to what was the interest of the then Chief Minister? There will never be any direct
evidence of the officers being pressurized, nor will they say that they were so pressurized. Ultimately
one has to draw the inference from the course of events, the manner in which the officers have acted
and changed their stand to suit the developer and the fact that the son-in-law of the then Chief
Minister was the developer of the project. As we have noted earlier the affidavit of the Commissioner
clearly indicated that he tried to place the correct legal position initially but ultimately had to give in
from the pressure from the superiors. Unless one is naove one will have to agree with the conclusion
which the Division Bench had drawn in para 136 of its judgment to the following effect:
"We are left with only one conclusion which we have to draw from the facts on record
and, to quote the words of the petitioners, "the conduct of respondent No.5 itself

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 119Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

indicates that he had ‘pressurized' the officials into taking an illegal action" and this,
in our view, is certainly misuse of executive powers."

128. The learned senior counsel who had appeared for the then Chief Minister in the High Court had
relied upon amongst others on the judgment of this Court in E.P. Royappa vs. State of Tamil Nadu
[AIR 1974 SC 555] . Krishna Iyer J. had observed in paragraph 92 of his judgment in that matter
that "we must not also overlook that the burden of establishing mala fides is very heavy on the
person who alleges it. The allegations of mala fides are often more easily made than proved, and the
very seriousness of such allegations demands proof of a high order of credibility." Shri Royappa,
while challenging his transfer had made allegations of mala fides against the then Chief Minister of
Tamil Nadu, and this Court had refused to accept those allegations. The Division Bench noted in the
presently impunged judgment that Shri Royappa was a Chief Secretary, and hardly any Chief
Secretary of a State Government was known who would be in any way hamstrung, or stopped from
getting information or documents on the basis of which he makes out the case of mala fides against
the officer holding a public office. The Division Bench rightly observed at the end of para 129 as
follows:
"We do agree with Mr. Salve that a finding of mala fides against public authority, that
too of the rank of Chief Minister of the State, should not be lightly drawn. It is quite a
serious matter. But, if the Court is required to draw such an inference after
examining the record, we feel that the Court cannot flinch from its duty."

129. In one earlier case i.e Shivajirao Nilangekar Patil v. Dr. Mahesh Madhav Gosavi [1987 (1) SCC
227], a single Judge of the Bombay High Court had held that in the facts of that case it could be
reasonably held that the marksheet of the M.D. Examination was tampered to benefit the daughter
of Shri Shivajirao, the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra. The Division Bench of the Bombay High
Court took the view that the circumstances relied on clearly formed a reasonable and cogent basis
for the adverse comments on the conduct of Shri Shivaji Rao. The Division Bench had noted that the
single Judge had followed the tests led down by this Court earlier in State of U.P. Vs. Mohammad
Naim [AIR 1964 SC 703] which were as follows:
"10. wee (a) whether the party whose conduct is in question is before the court or has
an opportunity of explaining or defending himself; (b) whether there is evidence on
record bearing on that conduct justifying the remarks; and (c) whether it is necessary
for the decision of the case, an in integral part thereof, to animadvert on that conduct.
It has also been recognized that judicial pronouncements must be judicial in nature,
and should not normally depart from sobriety, moderation and reserve."

Having approved the approach of the High Court this Court held in the facts of Shri Shivajirao's
Case as follows:
"50. There is no question in this case of giving any clear chit to the appellant in the
first appeal before us. It leaves a great deal of suspicion that tampering was done to

please Shri Patil or at his behest. It is true that there is no direct evidence. It is also

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 120Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

true that there is no evidence to link him up with tampering. Tampering is
established. The relationship is established. The reluctance to face a public enquiry is
also apparent. Apparently Shri Patil, though holding a public office does not believe
that "Ceaser's wife must be above suspicion....."

130. The facts of the present case are stronger than those in the case of Shri Shivajirao Nilangekar
(supra). Here also a relationship is established. The basic order dated 21.8.1996 in this matter
granting no objection to an illegal action is signed by the then Chief Minister himself. That was after
personally calling for the file containing the report dated 17.4.1996 sent by the Municipal
Commissioner much earlier. The entire narration shows that the then Chief Minister had clear
knowledge about this particular file all throughout, and the orders were issued only because the
developer was his son-in-law, and he wanted to favour him. Ultimately, one has to draw the
inference on the basis of probabilities. The test is not one of being proved guilty beyond reasonable
doubt, but one of preponderance of probabilities.

Appropriate actions taken in a Public Interest Litigation

131. It was contended before the High Court that the rule as to the construction of pleadings should
be strictly applied in the present case and that the material as contained in the petitions did not
justify any further probe. The High Court rightly rejected that argument. There was a sufficient
foundation in the petition for the further steps to be taken by the High Court. The petitions before
the High Court were in the nature of public interest litigation. The purpose in such matters is to
draw the attention of the High Court to a particular state of facts, and if the Government action is
found to be contrary to law or affecting the rights of the citizen, the court is required to intervene.
There was a specific plea in paragraph 10 of Writ Petition No. 4433 of 1998 to the effect that "the
fundamental and legal right of the citizens of Pune of submitting objections and suggestions to any
modification in the Final Development Plan u/s 37 of the act has been infringed", and that was
solely on account of the developer being a close relation of the then Chief Minister who was also the
Minister for Urban Development which controls the appointments of a Municipal Commissioner to
a Corporation established under the B.P.M.C Act 1949. A prima facie case had been made up in the
petitions which got supported when the High Court in exercise of its Writ Jurisdiction rightly called
for the relevant files from the State Government and the PMC to explain and defend their decisions.

132. Public Interest Litigation is not in the nature of adversarial litigation, but it is a challenge and
an opportunity to the government and its officers to make basic human rights meaningful as
observed by this Court in paragraph 9 of Bandhua Mukti Morcha Vs. Union of India [AIR 1984 SC
802]. By its very nature the PIL is inquisitorial in character. Access to justice being a Fundamental
Right and citizen's participatory role in the democratic process itself being a constitutional value,
accessing the Court will not be readily discouraged. Consequently, when the cause or issue, relates to
matters of good governance in the Constitutional sense, and there are no particular individuals or
class of persons who can be said to be injured persons, groups of persons who may be drawn from
different walks of life, may be granted standing for canvassing the PIL. A Civil Court acts only when
the dispute is of a civil nature, and the action is adversarial. The Civil Court is bound by its rules of
procedure. As against that the position of a Writ Court when called upon to act in protection of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 121Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

rights of the citizens can be stated to be distinct.

133. It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that inference should not be drawn merely on the
basis of the notings in the file, and the remarks made by the Division Bench ought to be expunged.
In this connection we may profitably refer to the observations of this Court in P.K. Dave Vs. Peoples’
Union of Civil Liberties (Delhi) & Ors. reported in 1996 (4) SCC 262. A Writ Petition by way of a PIL
was filed before the Delhi High Court alleging commission of gross financial irregularities by the
Director of Govt. Hospitals in Delhi. Notings in the office file produced by the Government showed
that despite suggestions made by the Health Secretary and Chief Secretary to the Delhi
Administration, Lt. Governor of the Administration had refused to take any action against the
Director. The High Court had passed strictures against the Lt. Governor. The learned senior counsel
Shri Venugopal appearing on behalf of the appellant Lt. Governor had submitted that the strictures
based on the basis of the notings should be expunged. Rejecting the submission this Court observed
in paragraph 8 as follows:
"Bases Where the relevant departmental files were produced before the court by the
Government and the court on scrutiny of the same came to the conclusion that the
decision has not been taken fairly, then the court would be entitled to comment on
the role of such person who took the decision..... In such circumstances if the
contention of Mr. Venugopal is accepted then no administrative authority and his
conduct would come under the judicial scrutiny of the court. That an administrative
order is subjected to judicial review is by now the settled position and no longer
remains res integra. This being the position we fail to appreciate the contentions of
Mr. Venugopal that the notings in the file or the orders passed by the Secretary and
Chief Secretary as well as the Governor should not have formed the basis of the
strictures passed against the appellant."

134. Reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in Jasbir Singh Chhabra Vs. State of Punjab
reported in 2010 (4) SCC 192 to submit that the issues and policy matters which are required to be
decided by the Government are dealt with by several functionaries, some of whom may record
notings on the files, and such notings recorded in the files cannot be made basis for a finding of
mala fides. There can be no dispute with the preposition when policy matters are involved as in that
case where the question was whether the State Government's refusal to sanction change of land use
from industrial to residential was vitiated due to mala fides claimed to be arising out of such
notings. In the present case we are concerned with the notings not concerning with any policy
matter, but with respect to the application on behalf of an individual landowner to delete the
reservation of a primary school on his land, where the developer is the son-in-law of the Chief
Minister. The notings in the present case are quite clear and the inference of mala fides therefrom is
inescapable.

135. We have noted the observations and the conclusions arrived at by the High Court with respect
to the conduct of the then Municipal Commissioner, the Minister of State and the then Chief
Minister. The High Court has drawn its inferences and made the remarks after following the dicta in
State of U.P. Vs. Mohd. Naim (supra). Having seen the totality of facts and guidelines laid down by

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 122Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

this Court in P.K. Dave's case (supra), we do not see that we can draw any other inference then the
one which was drawn by the Division Bench. We will be failing in our duty if we do not draw the
inference which clearly arises from the notings on the file, the affidavits filed by the persons
concerned and the law with respect to drawing such inference. In the circumstances, we refuse to
expunge any of these remarks rendered by the Division Bench.

Orders for Criminal Investigation

136. Having drawn the above inferences, and having made the adverse remarks about the conduct of
the then Chief Minister, Minister of State and Municipal Commissioner the impugned judgment has
directed the State of Maharashtra to initiate appropriate investigation against them through an
impartial agency, and if satisfied that any criminal offence has been committed to take such action
as warranted in law.

137. Now, as far as this direction is concerned, we have to note that as far as the Municipal
Commissioner is concerned, though the Division Bench did not approve his conduct and squarely
criticized him for being more loyal to the king then the king himself, yet in terms it observed in
paragraph 144 of the judgment, that it did not attributive any motive to him for his actions. This
para reads as follows:
"144. While we may not attribute any motive to respondent No.10 for his actions, we
cannot approve of the actions taken by him. We have already pointed out that the
action of withdrawing the appeal was wrong. In our view, respondent No.10 would
have served the interests of the PMC better if he had placed his dilemma before the
PMC and sought a resolution thereof, particularly when he believed that the
Government was issuing him instructions contrary to law, which he believed to exist.
But, perhaps, this might not have been clear to him at the time when he acted to
please his masters. While holding that the actions taken by the tenth respondent were
contrary to the provisions of the BPMC Act, MRTP Act and Development Control
Rule No.13.5, we find it difficult to accept the suggestion in the writ petitions that he
was a willing party to the process of abuse of executive powers."

That apart, Shri Narsimha, learned senior counsel appearing for the Municipal Commissioner drew
our attention to Section 147 of the MRTP Act which provides that no suit, prosecution or other legal
proceedings shall lie against any person for anything which is in good faith done or entitled to be
done under this Act or any rules or regulations made therein. Reliance was also placed on Section
486 of the B.P.M.C. Act 1949 which is also to the similar effect. The Division Bench has also clearly
stated that it did not accept the suggestion in the writ petitions that the Commissioner was willingly
a party to the process of abuse of executive powers. This being the position, in our view it would not
be correct to direct any criminal investigation against the then Municipal Commissioner, and in our
view to that extent the order of the Division Bench requires to be corrected.

138. As far as the Minister of State is concerned also, the Division Bench commented adversely on
his conduct in paragraph 140 of its judgment. Yet it also observed in paragraph 142 that there was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 123Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

nothing on record as suggested that he had any personal motive in the matter. The relevant
observation at the end of paragraph 142 reads as follows:
seneeee All that we can say is that there is nothing on record to suggest that he had any
other personal motive in the matter. We, therefore, infer that respondent No.6 must
have done it to oblige his senior colleague i.e. the then Chief Minister, respondent
No.5."

The Division Bench has thus specifically inferred that whatever he has done, was done to oblige his
senior Minister i.e. the then Chief Minister and he had no personal motive in the matter. In the
circumstances, he is entitled to a benefit of doubt and, therefore, the direction for criminal
investigation against him also can not be sustained.

139. As far as the Chief Minister is concerned, however, it is very clear that he was fully aware about
the application made by Shri Karandikar who was a camouflage for his son-in-law. He had called for
the file after the Municipal Commissioner sent his report in April, 1996. But for his personal
interest, the Government and the Municipal officers would not have taken the stand and put up the
notes that he wanted to be on record. The shifting of the reservation from F.P. No.110 was clearly
untenable under D.C. Rule 13.5. The by-passing of the Municipal Corporation and ignoring the
mandate of Section 37 was also not expected, yet he gave "no objection" to a contrary and totally
unjustified order. The earlier part of his order viz. "all action be taken in accordance with law"
therefore becomes meaningless, and is nothing but a camouflage. The conduct on the part of the
then Chief Minister prima-facie amounts to a misfeasance and Shri Wasudev, learned senior counsel
appearing for the original petitioners submits that such a conduct ought to be sternly dealt with.

140. The learned counsel for the Chief Minister on the other hand pointed out that there were no
prayers for prosecution in the Writ Petitions, and the direction contained in paragraph 227 (e) was
beyond the prayers. The question therefore, is whether the operative order passed by the High Court
in this behalf is legally tenable. The direction given by the High Court in paragraph 227 (e) is as
follows:
"(e) As far as prayer for directing prosecution against Respondent Nos. 5, 6 and 10 is
concerned, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case we are not
inclined to grant this relief. ...... Nonetheless, we direct the first respondent to make
appropriate investigations through an impartial agency and, if satisfied that any
criminal offences have been committed by the aforesaid respondents in the discharge
of their duties, to take action as is warranted in law."

Respondent Nos. 5, 6 and 10 were the then Chief Minister, the then Minister of State and the then
Municipal Commissioner.

141. In this context we have to take note of the judgment of a bench of three Judges of this Court in
this behalf on a review petition in the case of Common Cause, A Registered Society Vs. Union of

India & Ors. reported in 1999 (6) SCC 667. The Minister concerned in that matter had committed

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 124Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the misfeasance of allotment of retail outlets of petroleum products out of the discretionary quota in
an arbitrary and mala fide manner. Such allotments had been set aside by a bench of two Judges by
its judgment between the same parties reported in 1996 (6) SCC 530. The Court had thereafter
passed an order that the Minister concerned shall show cause within two weeks why a direction be
not issued to the appropriate police authority to register a case and initiate prosecution against him
for criminal breach of trust of any other offence under law. This Court held in paragraph 174 of its
judgment on the review petition as follows:
"174. The other direction, namely, the direction to CBI to investigate "any other
offence" is wholly erroneous and cannot be sustained. Obviously, direction for
investigation can be given only if any offence is, prima facie, found to have been
committed or a person's involvement is prima facie established, but a direction to
CBI to investigate whether any person has committed an offence or not cannot be
legally given. Such a direction would be contrary to the concept and philosophy of
"LIFE" and "LIBERTY" guaranteed to a person under Article 21 of the Constitution.
This direction is in complete negation of various decisions of this Court in which the
concept of "LIFE" has been explained in a manner which has infused "LIFE" into the
letters of Article 21."

142. It could be perhaps argued that the misfeasance on the part of the then Chief Minister and the
Minister of State amounts to a criminal misconduct also under Section 13 (1) (d) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988. In the present case however, there is neither any such reference to this section
nor any prima facie finding in the impugned judgment rendered way back in March 1999. In the
circumstances in view of the proposition of law enunciated by a larger bench in the above case it is
difficult to sustain the direction to make appropriate investigations through an impartial agency,
and if satisfied that any criminal offence has been committed by the aforesaid respondents in the
discharge of their duties, to take action as is warranted in law.

Epilogue Approach Towards the Planning Process

143. The significance of planning in a developing country cannot be understated. After years of
foreign rule when we became independent, leaders of free India realized that for advancement of our
society and for an orderly progress, we had to make a planned effort. Infact, even prior to
independence the leaders of the freedom struggle had applied their mind to this aspect. The leaders
of Indian Freedom Movement and particularly Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our first Prime Minister
always emphasised democratic planning as a method of nation building and economic and social
upliftment of Indian society. In March, 1931, the Indian National Congress at its Karachi Session
passed a resolution to the effect that the State shall take steps to secure that ownership and control
of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good.
Pandit Nehru drafted this resolution in consultation with Gandhiji and described it as a very short
step in a socialist direction. In 1938, the National Planning Committee of the Congress was set up
under the Chairmanship of Pandit Nehru who has been aptly described as "the Architect of
democratic planning in India". The Economic Programme Committee of the Congress under his
Chairmanship made a recommendation of setting up a permanent Planning Commission in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 125Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

1947-48.

144. Shri H.K. Paranjape, (1924-1993) an eminent Economist and a former Member of Monopolies
and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission and former Chairman of Railway Tariff Committee, in
his monograph "Jawaharlal Nehru and the Planning Commission" (published by Indian Institute of
Public Administration in September, 1964) notes that Nehru linked up the work of Planning
Commission directly to the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles enunciated in the
Constitution. Nehru always wanted to make sure that the objectives of the Planning Commission
were well defined and well understood. In this article, the author further records as follows:
"When the National Development Council was discussing the Draft Outline of the
Third Plan in September, 1960, he emphasized the importance of remembering "what
our objectives were and not to lose ourselves in the forest of details that a Plan had to
deal with. Because, always when one considered the detail, one must look back on the
main thing, how far it fitted in with the main issue; otherwise, it was out of place".

Nehru believed in participation of different sections of society in framing of the Plan. The emphasis
has always been amongst others to put land to the best use from the point of the requirements of our
society, since land is a scarce resource and it has to be used for the optimum benefit of the society

145. As stated above, we adopted the model of democratic planning which involves the participation
of the citizens, planners, administrators, Municipal bodies and the Government as is also seen
throughout the MRTP Act. Thus when it comes to the Development Plan for a city, at the initial
stage itself there is the consideration of the present and future requirements of the city. Suggestions
and objections of the citizens are invited with respect to the proposed plan, and then the planners
apply their mind to arrive at the plan which is prepared after a scientific study, and which will be
implemented during the next 10 to 20 years as laid down under Section 38 of the MRTP Act. The
plan is prepared after going through the entire gamut under Sections 21 to 30 of the Act, and then
only the sanction is obtained thereto from the State Government. That is why the powers to modify
the provisions of the plan are restricted as noted earlier. If the plan is to be tinkered for the benefit
of the interested persons, or for those who can approach the persons in authority, then there is no
use in having a planned development. Therefore, Section 37 which permits the minor modifications
provides that even that should not result into changing the character of the development plan, prior
whereto also a notice in the gazette is required to be issued to invite suggestions and objections.
Where the modification is of a substantial nature, then the procedure under Section 29 of the Act
requiring a notice in the local newspapers inviting objections and suggestions from the citizens is to
be resorted to. Even the deletion of reservation under Section 50 is at the instance of the appropriate
authority only when it does not want the land for the designated purpose.

146. The idea is that once the plan is formulated, one has to implement it as it is, and it is only in the
rarest of the rare cases that you can depart therefrom. There is no exclusive power given to the State
Government, or to the planning authority, or to the Chief Minister to bring about any modification,
deletion or de-reservation, and certainly not by a resort to any of the D.C. Rules. All these
constituents of the planning process have to follow the mandate under Section 37 or 22A as the case

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 126Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

may be if any modification becomes necessary. That is why this Court observed in paragraph 45 of
Chairman, Indore Vikas Prodhikaran Vs. Pure Industrial Coke & Chemicals Ltd. & Ors. reported in
2007 (8) SCC 705 as follows:
"45. Town and country planning involving land development of the cities which are

sought to be achieved through the process of land use, zoning plan and regulating

building activities must receive due attention of all concerned. We are furthermore

not oblivious of the fact that such planning involving highly complex cities depends

upon scientific research, study and experience and, thus, deserves due reverence.

(emphasis supplied) Role of Municipalities
147. The municipalities which are the planning authorities for the purpose of bringing about the
orderly development in the municipal areas, are given a place of pride in this entire process. They
are expected to render wide ranging functions which are now enumerated in the constitution. They
are now given a status under Part IX A of the Constitution introduced by the 74th Amendment w.e.f.
1.6.1993. Article 243W lays down the powers of the Municipalities to perform the functions which
are listed in the Twelfth Schedule. For performing these functions, planning becomes very
important. This Twelfth Schedule contains the following items:
"TWELFTH SCHEDULE [Article 243W]

1. Urban planning including town planning.

2. Regulation of land-use and construction of buildings.

3. Planning for economic and social development.

4. Roads and bridges.

5. Water supply for domestic, industrial and, commercial purposes.

6. Public health, sanitation conservancy and solid waste management.

7. Fire services.

8. Urban forestry, protection of the environment and promotion of ecological aspects.

g. Safeguarding the interests of weaker sections of society, including the handicapped
and mentally retarded.

10. Slum improvement and upgradation.
11. Urban poverty alleviation.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 127Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

12. Provision of urban amenities and facilities such as parks, gardens, playgrounds.
13. Promotion of cultural, educational and aesthetic aspects.

14. Burials and burial grounds; cremations, cremation grounds and electric
crematoriums.

15. Cattle ponds; prevention of cruelty to animals.
16. Vital statistics including registration of births and deaths.

17. Public amenities including street lighting, parking lots, bus stops and public
conveniences.

18. Regulation of slaughter houses and tanneries."

The primary powers of the Municipal Corporations in Maharashtra such as PMC (excluding some
Municipal Corporations which have their separate enactments) and of the Standing Committees of
the Corporations are enumerated in the BPMC Act. Coupled with those powers, the Municipal
Corporations have their powers under MRTP Act. These are the statutory powers, and they cannot
be bypassed.

The Responsibility of the Municipal Commissioner and the Senior Government Officers

148. The Municipal Commissioner is the Chief Executive of the Municipal Corporation. It is his
responsibility to act in accordance with these laws and to protect the interest of the Corporation. The
Commissioner is expected to place the complete and correct facts before the Government when any
such occasion arises, and stand by the correct legal position. That is what is expected of the senior
administrative officers like him. That is why they are given appropriate protection under the law. In
this behalf, it is worthwhile to refer to the speech of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Home
Minister of independent India, made during the Constituent Assembly Debates, where he spoke
about the need of the senior secretaries giving their honest opinions which may not be to the liking
of the Minister. While speaking about the safeguards for the Members of Indian Civil Service (now
Indian Administrative Service), he said
",..To-day, my Secretary can write a note opposed to my views. I have given that
freedom to all my Secretaries. I have told them ‘if you do not give your honest
opinion for fear that it will displease your Minister, please then you had better go. I
will bring another Secretary.' I will never be displeased over a frank expression of
opinion. That is what the Britishers were doing with the Britishers. We are now
sharing the responsibility. You have agreed to share responsibility. Many of them
with whom I have worked, I have no hesitation in saying that they are patriotic, as
loyal and as sincere as myself."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 128Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

(Ref: Constituent Assembly Debates. Vol.10 p. 50) Now unfortunately, we have a situation where the
senior officers are changing their position looking to the way the wind is blowing.

Expectations from the Political Executive

149. Same are the expectations from the political executive viz. that it must be above board, and
must act in accordance with the law and not in furtherance of the interest of a relative. However, as
the time has passed, these expectations are belied. That is why in the case of Shri Shivajirao
Nilangekar (supra) this Court had to lament in paragraph 51 of the judgment as follows:
"51. This Court cannot be oblivious that there has been a steady decline of public
standards or public morals and public morale. It is necessary to cleanse public life in
this country along with or even before cleaning the physical atmosphere. The
pollution in our values and standards in (sic is) an equally grave menace as the
pollution of the environment. Where such situations cry out, the courts should not
and cannot remain mute and dumb."

150. People of a state look up to the Chief Minister and those who occupy the high positions in the
Government and the Administration for redressal of their grievances. Citizens are facing so many
problems and it is expected of those in such positions to resolve them. Children are particularly
facing serious problems concerning facilities for their education and sports, quality of teaching, their
health and nutrition. It is the duty of those in high positions to ensure that their conduct should not
let down the people of the country, and particularly the younger generation. The ministers,
corporators and the administrators must zealously guard the spaces reserved for public amenities
from the preying hands of the builders. What will happen, if the protectors themselves become
poachers? Their decisions and conduct must be above board. Institutional trust is of utmost
importance. In the case of Bangalore Medical Trust (supra) this court observed in paragraph 45 of
its judgment that "the directions of the Chief Minister, the apex public functionary of the State, was
in breach of public trust, more like a person dealing with his private property than discharging his
obligation as head of the State administration in accordance with law and rules". Same is the case in
the present matter where Shri Manohar Joshi, the then Chief Minister and Shri Ravindra Mane, the
Minister of State have failed in this test, and in discharge of their duties. Nay, they have let down the
people of the city and the state, and the children.

Importance of the spaces for public amenities

151. As we have seen, the MRTP Act gives a place of prominence to the spaces meant for public
amenities. An appropriately planned city requires good roads, parks, playgrounds, markets, primary
and secondary schools, clinics, dispensaries and hospitals and sewerage facilities amongst other
public amenities which are essential for a good civic life. If all the spaces in the cities are covered
only by the construction for residential houses, the cities will become concrete jungles which is what
they have started becoming. That is how there is need to protect the spaces meant for public
amenities which cannot be sacrificed for the greed of a few landowners and builders to make more
money on the ground of creating large number of houses. The MRTP Act does give importance to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 129Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the spaces reserved for public amenities, and makes the deletion thereof difficult after the planning
process is gone through, and the plan is finalized. Similar are the provisions in different State Acts.
Yet, as we have seen from the earlier judgments concerning the public amenities in Bangalore
(Bangalore Medical Trust (supra) and Lucknow (M.I Builders Pvt. Ltd. (supra), and now as is seen
in this case in Pune, the spaces for the public amenities are under a systematic attack and are
shrinking all over the cities in India, only for the benefit of the landowners and the builders. Time
has therefore come to take a serious stock of the situation. Undoubtedly, the competing interest of
the landowner is also to be taken into account, but that is already done when the plan is finalized,
and the landowner is compensated as per the law. Ultimately when the land is reserved for a public
purpose after following the due process of law, the interest of the individual must yield to the public
interest.

152. As far as the MRTP Act is concerned, as we have noted earlier, there is a complete mechanism
for the protection of the spaces meant for public amenities. We have seen the definition of
substantial modification, and when the reservation for a public amenity on a plot of land is sought to
be deleted completely, it would surely be a case of substantial modification, and not a minor
modification. In that case what is required is to follow the procedure under Section 29 of the Act, to
publish a notice in local newspapers also, inviting objections and suggestions within sixty days. The
Government and the Municipal Corporations are trustees of the citizens for the purposes of
retention of the plots meant for public amenities. As the Act has indicated, the citizens are vitally
concerned with the retention of the public amenities, and, therefore deletion or modification should
be resorted to only in the rarest of rare case, and after fully examining as to why the concerned plot
was originally reserved for a public amenity, and as to how its deletion is necessary. Otherwise it will
mean that we are paying no respect to the efforts put in by the original planners who have drafted
the plan, as per the requirements of the city, and which plan has been finalized after following the
detailed procedures as laid down by the law.

Suggested safeguards for the future

153. Having noted as to what has happened in the present matter, in our view it is necessary that we
should lay down the necessary safeguards for the future so that such kind of gross deletions do not
occur in the future, and the provisions of the Act are strictly implemented in tune with the spirit
behind.

(i) Therefore, when the gazette notification is published, and the public notice in the local
newspapers is published under Section 29 (or under Section

37) it must briefly set out the reasons as to why the particular modification is being proposed. Since
Section 29 provides for publishing a notice in the ‘local newspapers’, we adopt the methodology of
Section 6 (2) of the L.A. Act, and expect that the notice shall be published atleast in two daily
newspapers circulating in the locality, out of which atleast one shall be in the regional language. We
expect the notice to be published in the newspapers with wide circulation and at prominent place
therein.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 130Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

(ii) Section 29 lays down that after receiving the suggestions and objections, the procedure as
prescribed in Section 28 is to be followed. Sub-section (3) of Section 28 provides for holding an
inquiry thereafter wherein the opportunity of being heard is to be afforded by the Planning
Committee (of the Planning Authority) to such persons who have filed their objections and made
suggestions. The Planning Committee, therefore, shall hold a public inquiry for all such persons to
get an opportunity of making their submission, and then only the Planning Committee should make
its report to the Planning Authority.

(iii) One of the reasons which is often given for modification/deletion of reservation is paucity of
funds, which was also sought to be raised in the present matter by the Municipal Commissioner for
unjustified reasons, in as much as the compensation amount had already been paid. However, if
there is any such difficulty, the planning authority must call upon the citizens to contribute for the
project, in the public notice contemplated under Section 29, in as much as these public amenities
are meant for them, and there will be many philanthropist or corporate bodies or individuals who
may come forward and support the public project financially. That was also the approach indicated
by this Court in Raju S. Jethmalani Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in [2005 (11) SCC 222].

Primary Education

154. Primary education is one of the important responsibilities to be discharged by Municipalities
under the Bombay Primary Education Act 1947. Again, to state the reality, even after sixty years
after the promulgation of the Constitution, we have not been able to attain full literacy. Of all the
different areas of education, primary education is suffering the most. When the Constitution was
promulgated, a Directive Principle was laid down in Article 45 which states that the State shall
endeavour to provide, within the period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution,
for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years. This
has not been achieved yet. The 86th Amendment to the Constitution effected in the year 2002
deleted this Article 45, and substituted it with new Article 45 which lays down that the State shall
endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age
of six years. The amendment has made Right to Education a Fundamental Right under Article 21A.
This Article lays down that the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of
the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine. In the year 2009
we passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009. All these laws have
however not been implemented with the spirit with which they ought to have been. We have several
national initiatives in operation such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, District Primary Education
Programme, and the Universal Elementary Education Programme to name a few. However, the
statistical data shows that we are still far away from achieving the goal of full literacy.

155. Nobel laureate Shri Amartya Sen commented on our tardy progress in the field of basic
education in his Article ‘The Urgency of Basic Education’ in the seminar "Right to

Education-Actions Now" held at New Delhi on 19.12.2007 as follows:
"India has been especially disadvantaged in basic education, and this is one of our
major challenges today. When the British left their Indian empire, only 12 per cent of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 131Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

the India population was literate. That was terrible enough, but our progress since
independence has also been quite slow. This contrasts with our rapid political
development into the first developing country in the world to have a functioning
democracy."

The story for Pune city is not quite different. Since the impugned development permission given by
the Municipal Corporation was on the basis of no objection of the Chief Minister dated 21.8.1996, we
may refer to the Educational Statistics of Pune city, at that time. As per the Census of India 1991, the
population of Pune city was 24,85,014, out of which 17,14,273 were the literate persons which comes
to just above 2/3 of the population. The percentage of literacy has gone up thereafter, but still we are
far away from achieving full literacy and from the goal of providing quality education and facilities
at the primary level.

156. There is a serious problem of children dropping out from the primary schools. There are wide
ranging factors which affect the education of the children at a tender age, such as absence of trained
teachers having the proper understanding of child psychology, ill-health, and mal-nutrition. The
infrastructural facilities are often very inadequate. Large number of children are cramped into small
classrooms and there is absence of any playground attached with the school. This requires adequate
spaces for the primary schools. Even in the so called higher middle class areas in large cities like
Pune, there are hardly any open spaces within the housing societies and, therefore, adequate space
for the playgrounds of the primary schools is of utmost importance. Having noted this scenario and
the necessity of spaces for primary schools in urban areas, it is rather unfortunate that the then
Chief Minister who claims to be an educationist took interest in releasing a plot duly reserved and
acquired for a primary school only for the benefit of his son-in-law. It also gives a dismal picture of
his deputy, the Minister of State acting to please his superior, and so also of the Municipal
Commissioner ignoring his statutory responsibilities.

Operative order with respect to the disputed buildings

157. We have held the direction given by the State Government for the deletion of reservation on
Final Plot No.110, and the commencement and occupation certificates issued by the Pune Municipal
Corporation in favour of the developer were in complete subversion of the statutory requirements of
the MRTP Act. The development permission was wholly illegal and unjustified. As far as the
building meant for the tenants is concerned, the developer as well as PMC have indicated that they
have no objection to the building being retained. As far as the ten storied building meant for the
private sale is concerned, the developer had offered to hand over half the number of floors to PMC,
provided it permits the remaining floors to be retained by the developer. PMC has rejected that offer
since the plot was reserved for a primary school. The building must therefore be either demolished
or put to a permissible use. The illegal development carried out by the developer has resulted into a
legitimate primary school not coming up on the disputed plot of land. Thousands of children would
have attended the school on this plot during last 15 years. The loss suffered by the children and the
cause of education is difficult to assess in terms of money, and in a way could be considered to be far
more than the cost of construction of this building. Removal of this building is however not going to
be very easy. It will cause serious nuisance to the occupants of the adjoining buildings due to noise

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132334/ 132Girish Vyas And Anr vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 12 October, 2011

and air pollution. The citizens may as well initiate actions against the PMC for appropriate reliefs. It
is also possible that the developer may not be able to remove the disputed building within a
specified time, in which case the PMC will have to incur the expenditure on removal. It will,
therefore, be open to the developer to redeem himself by offering the entire building to PMC for
being used as a primary school or for the earmarked purpose, free of cost. If he is so inclined, he
may inform PMC that he is giving up his claim on this building also in favour of PMC.

158. The High Court has not specified the time for taking the necessary steps in this behalf. Hence,
for the sake of clarity, we direct the developer to inform the PMC within two weeks from today
whether he is giving up the claim on the ten storied building named ‘Sundew Apartments' apart
from the tenants’ building in favour of PMC, failing which PMC will issue a notice to the developer
within two weeks thereafter, calling upon him to furnish particulars to PMC within two weeks from
the receipt of the notice, as to in what manner and time frame he proposes to demolish this ten
storied building. In the event the developer declines or fails to do so, or does not respond within the
specified period, or if PMC forms an impression after receiving his reply that the developer is
incapable of removing the building in reasonably short time, the PMC will go ahead and demolish
the same. In either case the decision of the City Engineer of PMC with respect to the manner of
removal of the building and disposal of the debris shall be final.

159. As far as the ownership of the plot is concerned, the same will abide by the decision of the High
Court in First Appeal Stamp No. 18615 of 1994 which will be decided in accordance with law. The
old tenants will continue to occupy the building meant for the tenants.

160. The PMC and the State Government have fairly changed/reviewed their legal position in this
Court, and defended their original stand about the illegality of the construction. We therefore,
absolve both of them from paying costs to the original petitioners. The order with respect to
payment of cost of Rs. 10,000/- against the then Chief Minister and the Minister of State to each of
the original petitioners however remains. Over and above we add Rs. 15,000/- for each of them to
pay to the two petitioners separately towards the cost of these appeals in this Court. Thus, the then
Chief Minister and the Minister of State shall each pay Rs. 25,000/- to the two petitioners
separately.

161. The spaces for public amenities such as roads, playgrounds, markets, water supply and
sewerage facilities, hospitals and particularly educational institutions are essential for a decent
urban life. The planning process therefore assumes significance in this behalf. The parcels of land
reserved for public amenities under the urban plans cannot be permitted to be tinkered with. The
greed for making more money is leading to all sorts of construction for housing in prime city areas
usurping the lands meant for public amenities wherever possible and in utter disregard for the
quality of life. Large number of areas in big cities have already become concrete jungles bereft of
adequate public amenities. It is therefore, that we have laid down the guidelines in this behalf which
flow from the scheme of the MRTP Act itself so that this menace of grabbing public spaces for
private ends stops completely. We are also clear that any unauthorised construction particularly on
the lands meant for public amenities must be removed forthwith. We expect the guidelines laid
down in this behalf to be followed scrupulously.

The conclusions in nutshell and the consequent order
162. In the circumstances we conclude and pass the following order 
(i) We hold that the direction given by the Government of Maharashtra for the deletion of
reservation on Final Plot No. 110, at Prabhat Road, Pune, and the consequent Commencement and
Occupation certificates issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in favour of the developer
were in complete subversion of the statutory requirements of the MRTP Act. The development
permission was wholly illegal and unjustified.

(ii) The direction of the High Court in the impugned judgment dated 6/15.3.1999 in Writ Petition
Nos. 4433 and 4434/1998 for demolition of the concerned building was fully legal and justified.

(iii) The contention of the landowner that his right of development for residential purposes on the
concerned plot under the erstwhile Town Planning scheme subsisted in spite of coming into force of
Development Plan reserving the plot for a primary school, is liable to be rejected.

(iv) The acquisition of the concerned plot of land was complete with the declaration under Section
126 of the MRTP Act read with Section 6 of Land Acquisition Act and the same is valid and legal.

(v) The order passed by the High Court directing the Municipal Corporation to move for the revival
of the First Appeal Stamp No. 18615 of 1994 was therefore necessary. The High Court is expected to
decide the revived First Appeal at the earliest and preferably within four months hereafter in the
light of the law and the directions given in this judgment.

(vi) The developer shall inform the PMC whether he is giving up the claim over the construction of
the ten storied building (named ‘Sundew Apartments’) apart from the tenants' building in favour of
PMC, failing which either the developer or the PMC shall take steps for demolition of the disputed
building (Sundew Apartments) as per the time frame laid down in this judgment.

(vii) The former occupants of F.P No. 110 will continue to reside in the building constructed for the
tenants on the terms stated in the judgment.

(viii) The corporation will not be required to pay any amount to the developer for the tenants'
building constructed by him, nor for the ten storied building in the event he gives up his claim over
it in favour of PMC.

(ix) The strictures passed by the High Court against the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Shri
Manohar Joshi and the then Minister of State Shri Ravindra Mane are maintained. The prayer to

expunge these remarks is rejected. The remarks against the Municipal Commissioner are however
deleted.

(x) The order directing criminal investigation and thereafter further action as warranted in law, is
however deleted in view of the judgment of this Court in the case of Common Cause A Registered

(xi) The then Chief Minister and the then Minister of State shall each pay cost of Rs. 15,000/- to
each of the two petitioners in the High Court towards these ten appeals, over and above the cost of
Rs. 10,000/- awarded by the High Court in the writ petitions payable by each of them to the two writ
petitioners.

(xii) The State Government and the Planning authorities under the MRTP Act shall hereafter
scrupulously follow the directions and the suggested safeguards with respect to the spaces meant for
public amenities.

All the appeals stand disposed of as above.

HEADNOTE:

The Andhra Pradesh Legislature passed the Andhra Pradesh
Gram Panchayat Act, 1964. The Kuthbullapur Gram Panchayat
was established under the Act. The respondent constructed a
factory and other buildings without the permission of the
Gram Panchayat. Later on, the respondent asked for expostfacto permission. The Panchayat agreed to grant the
permission on the respondent paying permission fee at 1-1/2
per cent on the capital value of the factory building and at
1 percent on the capital value of other buildings. The
Panchayat also called upon the respondents to pay the house
tax.

The respondents filed a Writ Petition in the High Court

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427407/Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr vs Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd on 1 May, 1975

challenging the levy of house tax and permission fee. The
High Court allowed the Writ Petition holding that the
buildings constructed by the respondents did not fall within
the definition of a house and further ruled that since no
services were rendered, the levy of, permission fee was
illegal. Section 69 of the Act authorises the Gram
Panchayat to levy a house tax.
The definition of house as it stood when the
High Court delivered its judgment was a
building or hut fit for human occupation
whether as a residence or otherwise, having a
separate principal entrance from the common
way and included any shop, workshop- or
warehouse or any building used for garaging or
parking of buses or as a bus stand. The High
Court held that the buildings other than
factory premises were not a house’ because
their separate principal entrance was situated
on the road belonging to the respondents.
As regards the factory buildings, the High Court held that
the legislature included shops, workshops, and warehouses,
but aid not include factory within the definition of the
house. The demand of house tax was held to be illegal.
After the judgment of the High Court was delivered, the
Legislature amended the definition of the house
retrospectively to include the buildings constructed by the
respondents.
The appellant contended that the new definition of the house
clearly includes the buildings constructed by the respondent
and that the Panchayat was entitled to impose house tax on
the respondent. Secondly, the Gram Panchayat lays roads,
provides for drainage and lights, scrutinises the plans
submitted for intended construction, and, therefore, is
entitled to charge the permission fee. In the alternative,
it was contended that the permission fee though called a fee
is really in the nature of a tax on buildings and may be
upheld as such.
Respondent contended
1. By redefining the term 'houses with retrospective effect,
the Legislature encroached upon a judicial function.
2. Without a proper budget, the Gram Panchayat cannot impose
taxes.
395
3. There is no provision in the Act empowering the Gram
Panchayat to levy permission fees.
4. No services are rendered for which permission fees can be
charged.
Partly allowing the appeal,
HELD : The Legislature has power to pass a law prospectively
as well as retrospectively. The Legislature can remove the
basis of the decision rendered by a court. The Amending Act
does not ask the instrumentalities of the State to disobey
or disregard the decision given by the High Court, but

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427407/Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr vs Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd on 1 May, 1975

merely removes the basis of that decision. Under Article
246(3) read with Entry 49 in List II of the 7th Schedule,
the State Legislature has exclusive power to make laws with
respect to taxes on lands and buildings. Section 69 of the
Act authorises the Gram Panchayats to levy house tax in the'
villages under their respective jurisdiction. The house tax
was rightly imposed by the Gram Panchayat. [398 B.F., 399
DEF]

HELD FURTHER-The argument about absence of budget was not
made in the High Court and as it involves an investigation
into facts, this Court cannot go into it for the first time.
[400-DE]

HELD FURTHER-There is no provision in the Act empowering the
Gram Panchayat to levy fees on the permission to construct a
building. In fact, there is no provision in the Act to
obtain the permission of the Gram Panchayat for construction
of building. Fees are a sort of return or consideration for
services rendered which makes it necessary that there should
be an element of quid pro quo in the imposition of a _ fee.
There has to be co-relationship between the fee levied by an
authority and the services rendered by it to the person who
is required to pay the fee. In this case, there is no such
co-relationship. Fees cannot be imposed for discharging
statutory functions of public authorities. The services
have to be rendered individually to the particular person on
whom the fee is imposed. The very fact that the permission
fee is levied at a certain percentage of the capital value
of the buildings shows that the Gram Panchayat itself never
intended to correlate the fee with the services rendered or
intended to be rendered by it. [400-H, 401-DE, 402 c]

JUDGMENT:
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 1189 of 1972.

From the Judgment and order dated 6th August, 1971 of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in W. P.
No. 4223 of 1969. P. Ram Reddy and P. P. Rao, for the appellants. B. Sen and Naunit Lal, for the
respondent.

K. Srinivasanmurthy, Naunit Lal and Lalita Kohli, for the inter-verners.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, J. This is a tax dispute concerning
the power of the second appellant, Kuthbullapur Gram Panchayat, to levy house-tax and Permission
Fee on the respondent. The Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd., which is a Government of India
Undertaking. The first appellant is the Government of Andhra Pradesh.

The Kuthbullapur Gram Panchayat was established in 1959. In 1964 the Andhra Pradesh State
Legislature passed the Andhra Pradesh Gram Panchayats Act, 2 of 1964, which with he exception of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427407/ 3Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr vs Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd on 1 May, 1975

Chapter VII of the Act, came into force on January 18,1964.The Act to the Kuthbullapur Gram
Panchayat within whose geographical limits the respondent has established a factory for the
manufacture of special apparatus machines, presses etc. The construction of the factory began in
1964 and was completed in December 1965. The factory was con- structed without the permission of
the Gram Panchayat. Considering the skeleton staff which mans the Panchayat and its skeleton
activities, the respondent's plea that it did not obtain the Panchayat's permission bemuse it was not
aware of its existence is not implausible. But such awareness has no relevance on the respondent's
liability to pay taxes and fees. In any event, on coming to know of the construction of the factory and
the other buildings the Panchayat asked the respondent to obtain the requisite permission. The
respondent asked for ex-postfacto permission in January, 1967.

In its meeting of May 8, 1967 the Panchayat passed a resolution for collecting Permission Fee from
the respondent at 1/2% on the capital value of the factory buildings and at 1% on the capital value of
other buildings. By a letter dated August 20, 1968 the Panchayat called upon the respondent to pay
house-tax for the years 1966-67, 1967-68 and 1968-69 amounting to Rs. 1,83,750 at the rate of Rs.
61,250 per annum. On March 3, 1969 the Panchayat demanded from the respondent a sum of Rs.
1,65,000 by way of Permission Fee, Rs. 80,000 being for factory buildings and Rs. 85,000 in respect
of the, other buildings. On November 25, 1969 the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court
of Andhra Pradesh Challenging the levy of house tax and the Permission Fee. By its judgment dated
August 6, 1971 the High Court allowed the writ petition. It held that the buildings constructed by the
respondent did not fall within the definition of a ‘house’ as contained in the Act and therefore no
house-tax could be levied on the buildings. Regarding the Permission Fee the High Court re- pelled
the appellant's contention that the fee was in the nature of tax and held that since no services were
rendered by the Panchayat to the respondent the levy of Permission Fee was illegal. The High Court
has granted to the appellants a Certificate of Fitness under Article 133(1) (a) of the Constitution to
appeal to this Court. Section 69(1) (a) of the Act provides that a Grain Panchayat shall levy in the
village a house-tax. By section 2(15), as it stood when the High Court delivered its judgment, "house'
meant a building or hut fit for human occupation, whether as a residence or otherwise, "having a
separate principal entrance from the common way," and included "any shop, workshop or
warehouse or any building used for garaging or parking buses or as a bus-stand". The High Court
held that buildings other than factory premises were not a ‘house’ within the meaning of the Act
because their separate principal entrances were situated on the roads belonging to the respondent
and not on the common way as required by section 2(15). As regards the factory buildings, the High
Court held that the Legislature had included shops, 39 7 workshops and warehouses but not
factories within the definition of a ‘house’ and therefore factory buildings were also not a ‘house’
within the meaning of the Act. The demand. of house-tax was accordingly held illegal. By the Andhra
Pradesh Gram Panchayats (Amendment) Act, 16 of 1974, the State Legislature has amended the
definition of house with retrospective effect so as to eliminate the impediments on which the High
Court rested its judgment. If the amendment is lawful and valid, it will be unnecessary to consider
whether the High Court was right in reading the way it did the definition of "house' as contained in
the unamended section 2(15).

Section 2 of the Amending Act provides "2. For clause (15) of section 2 of the Andhra Pradesh Gram
Pancbayats Act, 1964 (hereinafter referred to as the principal Act), the following clause shall be and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427407/ 4Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr vs Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd on 1 May, 1975

shall be deemed always to have been substituted, namely :- "(15) 'house' means a building or hut fit
for human occupation, whether as a residence or otherwise. and includes any shop, factory,
workshop or warehouse or any building used for garaging or parking buses or as a bus-stand, cattle
shed (other than a cattle shed in an agricultural land), poultry shed or dairy shed" ;

Section 4(a) of the Amending Act provides "4. Notwithstanding anything in any judgment, decree or
order of any court or other authority,
(a)anything done or any action taken, including any tax levied and collected, in the exercise of any
power conferred by or under the principal Act shall be deemed, to be and to have always been, done
or taken or leived and collected in the exercise of the powers conferred by to under the principal Act
as amended by section 2 of this Act , as if the principal Act as amended by this Act were in force on
the date on which. such thing was done or action was taken, or tax was levied and collected; and all
arrears of tax and other amounts due under the principal Act as amended by this Act at the
commencement of this Act, may be recovered as if they had accrued under the principal Act as
amended by this Act";

The new definition of ‘house’ which is to be read retrospectively in to the Act meets effectively both
the objections by reason of which the High Court held that the buildings constructed by the
respondent were not a 'house'. By the Amendment the old clause "having a separate principal
entrance from the common way" is dropped and the definition of 'house' is reframed to include a
‘factory’. It is clear and is undisputed that the buildings constructed by the respondent-the colony
buildings as well as the factory buildings-answer fully the description of a house and are squarely
within the new definition contained in section 2(15).

We see no substance in the respondent's contention that by redefining the term ‘house’ with
retrospective effect and by validating the levies imposed under the unamended Act as if,
notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment decree or order of any court, that Act as
amended was in force on the date when the tax was levied, the Legislature has encroached upon a
judicial, function. The power of the Legislature to pass a law postulates the power to pass it
prospectively as well as retrospectively, the one no less than the other. Within the scope of its
legislative competence and subject to other constitutional limitations, the power of the Legislature
to enact laws is plenary. In United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum (1) Gwyer, C.J. while repelling the
argument that Indian Legislatures had no power to alter the existing laws retrospectively, observed
that within the limits of their powers the Indian Legislatures were as supreme and sovereign as the
British Parliament itself and that those powers were not subject to the "strange and unusual
prohibition against retrospective legislation". The power to validate a law, retrospectively is, subject
to the limitations aforesaid, an ancillary power to legislate on the particular subject.

The State legislature, it is significant, has not overruled or set aside the judgment of the High Court.
It has amended the definition of 'house' by the substitution of a new section 2(15) for the old section
and it has provided that the new definition shall have retrospective effect, notwithstanding anything
contained in any judgment, decree or order of any court or other authority. In other words, it has
removed the basis of the decision rendered by the High Court so that the decision could not have

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427407/ 5Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr vs Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd on 1 May, 1975

been given in the altered circumstances. If the old section 2(15) were to define "house' in the manner
that the amended section 2(15) does, there is doubt that the decision of the High Court would have
been otherwise. In fact, it was not disputed before us that the buildings constructed by the
respondent meet fully the requirements of section 2(15) as amended by the Act of 1974.

In Tirath Ram Rajindra Nath v. State of U. P. (2), the Legislature amended the law retrospectively
and thereby removed the basis of the decision rendered by the High Court of Allahabad. It was held
by this Court that this was within the permissible limits and validation of the old Act by amending it
retrospectively did not constitute an encroachment on the functions of the judiciary. The decisions
on which the respondent relies are clearly distinguishable. In the Municipal Corporation of the City
of Allahabad v. The New Shrock Spg. & Wvg. Co. Ltd. (3) the impugned provision commanded the
Corporation to refuse to refund the amount illegally (1) (1940)F.C.R. 110.

(2) A.LR. 1973 S.C. 405.
(3) A.LR. 1970 S.C. 1292.

collected by it despite the orders of the Supreme Court and the High Court. As the basis of these
decisions remained unchanged even after the amendment, it was held by this Court that the
legislature had made a direct inroad into the Judicial powers. In Janpada Sabha Chindwara etc., v.
The Central Provinces Syndicate Ltd.,(1) the Madhya Pradesh Legislature passed a Validation Act in
order to rectify the defect pointed out by this Court in the imposition of a cess. But the Act did not
set out the nature of the amendment nor did it provide that the notifications issued without the
sanction of the State Government would be deemed to have been issued validly. It was held by this
Court that this was tantamount to saying that the judgment of a court rendered in the exercise of its
legitimate jurisdiction was to be deemed to be ineffective. The position in, State of Tamil Nadu v. M.
Rayappa Gounder (2) was similar. In that case the reassessment made under an Act which did not
provide for reassessments were attempted to be validated without changing the law retrospectively.
This was considered to be an encroachments on the judicial functions. 'In the instant case the
Amending Act of 1974, cures the old definition contained in section 2(15) of the vice from which it
suffered. The amendment has been given retrospective effect and as stated earlier the legislature has
the power to make the law passed by it retroactive. As the Amending Act does not ask the
instrumentalities' of the State to disobey or disregard the decision given by 'the High Court but
removes the basis of its decision, the challenge made by the respondent to the Amending Act must
fail. The levy of the, house-tax must therefore be upheld.

Under Article 246(3) read with Entry 49 in List II, Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the State
legislatures have exclusive power to make laws with respect to "Taxes on lands and buildings"
Section 69(1)(a) of the Act authorises Gram Panchayats to levy house.-tax in the villages under their
respective jurisdiction. The Gram Panchayat of Kuthbullapur has accordingly levied house-tax on
the buildings constructed by the respondent including the factory buildings. It needs to be clarified
that by Rule 6 of the "Rules relating to levy of House-Tax", machinery and furniture are to be
excluded from consideration for the purpose of assessment to house-tax. Thus, the tax is on
buildings only and does not transgress the scope of Entry

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427407/ 6Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr vs Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd on 1 May, 1975

49. This clarification became necessary in view of the respondent's contention that the State
legislature has no power under Entry 49, List II, to levy tax on the lands and buildings owned or
occupied by a factory. Entry 36 in List III relates to "Factories" and Entry 47 in that List relates to
"Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List, but not including fees taken in any court". It is
urged on behalf of the respondent that these specific Entries in regard to the, particular subject
matter exhaust the power to impose levies on factories and 'since the power is limited to the
imposition of fees on (1) A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 57. A.LR. 1971 S.C. 231.

factories, the legislature has no competence to impose a tax on the lands or buildings of a factory. It
is true that the various Entries in the legislature Lists must receive a broad and liberal construction
and Entry 36 in List III may therefore cover every aspect of the subject matter of "Factories". But the
State legislature has not authorised the levy of, house-tax on factories in the compendious sense.
The new definition of ‘house’ includes a ‘factory’ but the house-tax is levied only on the buildings
occupied by the factory and not on the machinery and furniture. The State legislature has the
legislative competence to do so under Entry 49 in List II.

It was urged by Mr. Naunit Lal on behalf of one of the interveners that 'Factory' is a compendious
expression and since a factory consists of the building, the machinery and the furniture, the
legislature cannot split up the personality of the factory and tax one part of it only. There is no
substance in this contention because the power to tax a building can be exercised without reference
to the use to which the building as put and it irrelevant that the building is occupied by a factory
which cannot conduct its activities without the machinery and furniture. What falls legitimately
within the scope of a legislative Entry can lawfully form the subject matter of legislation. We cannot
entertain the respondent's argument that without a proper budget, the Gram Panchayat cannot
impose a tax. Such an argument was not made in the High Court and it involves an investigation
into the fact whether the Gram Panchayat had or had not prepared a budget. Nor can we entertain
the respondents submission that section 4(b) and (c) of the Act of 1974 are invalid. Under clause (b),
no suit or other proceeding is maintainable or can be continued in any court or before any authority
for the refund, of any tax. Under clause (c), no court shall enforce any decree or order directing the
refund of any such tax. No suit has been filed by the respondent for the refund of tax and no decree
or order has been passed by any court or any authority for the refund of any tax. This Court does not
answer academic questions.

The position in regard to the so called 'Permission Fee' is entirely different. In the first place, the Act
of 1964 itself makes a distinction between the power to impose a tax and the power to impose a fee.
Section 69(1) and section 69(3)(i), (ii), (iii) empower the Gram Panchayats to levy taxes while
section 69(3) (v) and (vi) provide for the levy of fees. Sections 92, 109(2), 111, 121(5), 122 and section
131 of the Act also provide for the imposition of specific fees. There is no provision in the Act
empowering the Gram Panchayats to levy fees on the permission to construct a building, which is
what the second appellant has purported to do in the instant case.

In fact, there is no provision in tile Act under which it is necessary to obtain the permission of the
Gram Panchayat for constructing a building. Section 131(2) of the Act which authorises the levy of

fees for every licence or permission is therefore not attracted. Section 125(1) requires that the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427407/ 7Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr vs Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd on 1 May, 1975

permission of the Gram Panchayat must be, obtained for constructing or establishing a factory,
workshop or work-place in which it is proposed to employ steam power, water power or other
mechanical power or electrical power or in which it is proposed to install any machinery or
manufacturing plant driven by steam, water or other power as aforesaid. The provision may possibly
support a levy of Permission Fee on the factory buildings, but there is no provision in the Act at all
requiring the permission of. the Gram Panchayat for the construction of other buildings. Counsel for
the appellants wanted to derive sustenance to the imposition of Permission Fee from the provision
contained in section 217(2) (xvi) but that clause only empowers the Government to make rules "as to
the regulation or restriction of building and the use of sites for building". In the absence of any
provision in the parent Statute requiring the permission of the Gram Panchayat for the construction
of non-factory buildings, the rule-making power of the Government cannot be exercised so as to
impose. the requirement of a permission in respect of such buildings.

But there is a broader ground on which the levy of Permission Fee must be struck down. Fees are a
sort of return or consideration for services rendered which makes it necessary that there should be
an element of quid pro quo in the imposition of a fee. There has to be a correlation-ship between the
fee levied by an authority Ind the services rendered by it to the person who is required to pay the
fee(1). There is, in this case, not a word showing such a correlationship. In the counter-affidavit
which the appellants filed in the High Court in reply to the respondent's writ petition, nothing at all
was stated as to the expenses incurred or likely to be incurred by the Gram Panchayat in rendering
any actual or intended service to the respondent. There may be something in the grievance of the
Gram Panchayat that the mighty respondent and others following the respondent's lead have been
persistently refusing to pay taxes which has made it impossible for the Gram Panchayat to render
any services. But the true legal position as stated by Mukherjea, J. in the Commissioner, Hindu
Religious Endowments Madras v. Shri Lakshmindar Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shiur Mutt(2) is that ‘it
is absolutely necessary that the levy of fees should on 'the face of the legislative provision, be
correlated to the expenses incurred by Government in rendering the services". In the total absence
of any data showing such a correlationship, the levy of Permission Fee has to fail. One cannot take
into account the sum total of the activities of a public body like a Gram Panchayat to seek
justification for the fees imposed by it. The expenses incurred by a Gram Panchayat or a
Municipality in discharging its obligatory functions are usually met by the imposition of a variety of
taxes. For justifying the imposition of fees the public authority has to show what services are
rendered or H intended to be rendered individually to the particular person on whom the fee is
imposed. The Gram Panchayat here has not even prepared an estimate of what the intended services
would cost it.

(1) [1954] S C.R. 1005: A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 846. (2) [1954] S.C.R. 1005, 1042.

Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the Gram Panchayat lays roads for providing
access to new buildings,that it provides for drainage and lights and that it scrutinises the plans
submitted for intended constructions and, if necessary, it advises the applicants in order that the
proposed construction may conform to the regulations. We are unable to accept that these services
are rendered individually to the respondent. The laying of roads and drainage or the supply of
street-lights are a statutory function of public authorities and it is difficult to hold, in the absence of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427407/ 8Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr vs Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd on 1 May, 1975

any material, that any of such services as have been mentioned to us have in fact been rendered to
the respondent. The very circumstance that the Permission Fee is levied at a certain percentage of
the capital value of the buildings shows that the Gram Panchayat itself never intended to correlate
the fee with the services rendered or intended to be rendered by it. There is therefore no warrant for
the levy of Permission Fee, not even on factory buildings, assuming for the sake of argument that the
permission of Gram Panchayat is necessary for the construction of factory buildings.

It was alternatively contended on behalf of the appellants that the Permission Fee though called a
fee is really in the nature of a tax on buildings and may be upheld as such. It is impossible to accept
this contention. That the Permission Fee is not a tax on buildings is clear from the fact that the fee
may be required to be paid even if a building does not eventually come into existence. The scheme
under which the Permission Fee is attempted to be levied is that it becomes payable at the time
when the permission to construct a building is applied for. The levy does not depend upon whether a
building has been in fact constructed with the result that whether a building is constructed or not,
the fee has to be paid. In other words, the Permission Fee is in the nature of a levy on a proposed
activity and is not a tax on buildings.

Thus, the levy of house-tax is lawful but the levy of Permission Fee has to be struck down as being
illegal. Accordingly the appeal is allowed partly but since the success is divided, there will be no
order as to costs.

Appeal partly allowed.

HEADNOTE:
The appellant manufactures steel tubes in the outskirts
of Ahmedabad city. It started its business in 1960, went

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

into production since 1964 and waggled from infancy to
adulthood with smiling profits and growling workers,
punctuated by smouldering demands, strikes and settlement
until there brewed a confrontation culminating in a head-on
collision following upon certain unhappy happenings. A total
strike ensued whose chain reaction was a_ whole-sale
termination of all employees followed by fresh recruitment
of workmen defacto breakdown of the strike and dispute over
restoration of the removed workmen.

As per the last settlement between the management and
the workmen of 4th August, 1972, it was not open to the
workmen to resort to a strike till the expiry of a period of
five years; nor could the management declare a lock out till
then. Any dispute arising between the parties, according to
the terms arrived at were to be sorted out through
negotiation or, failing that by recourse to arbitration. The
matter was therefore, referred to an arbitrator and the
arbitrator by his award held the action cf the management
warranted. The respondent challenged the decision of the
arbitrator under Article 226/227 of the Constitution and the
High Court of Gujarat reversed the award and substantially
directed reinstatement. Hence the appeals both by the
Management and the workmen.

Dismissing the appeals and modifying the awards
substantially, the Court

HELD: (By Majority)

Per Iyer J. On behalf of D. A. Desai J. and himself.

(i) The basic assumption is that the strike was not
only illegal but also unjustified. [210 H]

147

(ii) The management did punish its 853 workmen when it
discharged them for reasons of misconduct set out in
separate but integrated proceedings; even though with legal
finesse, the formal order was phrased in harmless verbalism.

[211 A]
(iii) The action taken under the general law or the
standing orders, was illegal in the absence of

individualised charge sheets, proper hearing and personalise
punishment if found guilty. None of these steps having been
taken, the discharge orders were still born. But, the
Management could, as in this case it did, offer to make out
the delinquency of the employees and the arbitrator had, in
such cases, the full jurisdiction to adjudge de novo both
guilt and punishment. [211 B-C]

(iv) Section 11A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
does take in an arbitrator too, and in this case, the

arbitral reference, apart from section 11A is plenary in
scope. [211 C-D]
(v) Article 226 of the Constitution, however

restrictive in practice Is a power wide enough in all
conscience, to be a friend in need when the summons comes in
a crisis froma victim of injustice; and more importantly

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

this extra-ordinary reserve power is unsheathed to grant
final relief without necessary recourse to a remand. What
the Tribunal may in its discretion do the High Court too
under Article 226, can, if facts compel so. [211 D-E]

(vi) The Award, in the instant case, suffers froma
fundamental flaw that it equates an illegal and unjustified
strike with brozen misconduct by every workman without so
much as identification of the charge against each, after
adverting to the gravamen of his misconduct meriting
dismissal. Passive participation in a strike which is both
illegal and unjustified does not ipso facto invite dismissal
or punitive discharge. There must be active individual
excess such as master-minding the unjustified aspects of the
strike, e.g., violence, sabotage or other reprehensible
role. Absent such gravamen in the accusation, the extreme
economic penalty of discharge is wrong. An indicator of the
absence of such grievous guilt is that the management, after
stating in strong terms all the sins of workmen, took back
over 400 of them as they trickled back slowly and beyond the
time set, with continuity of service, suggestive of the
dubiety of the inflated accusations and awareness of the
minor role of the mass of workmen in the lingering strike.
Furthermore, even though all sanctions short of punitive
discharge may be employed by a Management, low wages and
high cost of living, dismissal of several hundreds with
disastrous impact on numerous families is of such sensitive
social concern that, save in exceptional situations, the law
will inhibit such a lethal step for the peace of the
industry, the welfare of the workmen and the broader justice
that transcends transcient disputes. The human dimensions
have decisional relevance. The discharge orders though
approved by the Arbitrator are invalid. [211 E-H, 212 A-B]

HELD FURTHER: 1. In a society, capital shall be the
brother and keeper of labour and cannot disown this
obligation of a partner in management, especially because
social justice and Articles 43 and 43A are constitutional
Mandates. The policy directions in Articles 39, 41, 42, 43
and 43A speak af the right to an adequate means of
livelihood, the right to work, humane conditions of work,
living wages ensuring a decent standard of life and
enjoyment of leisure and participation of workers in
Management of industries. De hors these
148
Mandates, law will fail functionally. Suck is the value
vision of Indian Industrial Jurisprudence. [155 B, G-H, 156
A]

2. Jural resolution of labour disputes must be sought
in the law life complex beyond the factual blinkers of
decided cases, beneath the lexical littleness of statutory
tests, in the economic basics of industrial justice which
must enliven the consciousness of the Court and the corpus
juris. [154 F-G]

The golden rule for the judicial resolution of an

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

industrial dispute is first to persuade fighting parties, by
judicious suggestions, into the  peace-making zone,
disentangle the differences, narrow the mistrust gap and
convert them through consensual steps, into negotiated
justice. Law is not the last word in justice, especially
social justice. Moreover in an hierarchical system, the
little man lives in the short run but most litigation lives
in the long run. So it is that negotiation first and
adjudication next, is a welcome formula for the Bench and
the Bar, the Management and Union. [157 C-E]

The anatomy of a dismissal order is not a mystery, once
it is agreed that substance, not semblance, governs the
decision. Legal criteria are not so slippery that verbal
Manipulations may outwit the Court. The fact is the index of
the mind and an order fair on its face may be taken at its
face value. But there is more to it than that, because
sometimes words are designed to conceal deeds by linguistic
engineering. The form of the order of the language in which
it is couched is not conclusive. The Court will lift the
veil to see the the nature of the order. [171 G-H. 172 A]

If two factors-motive and foundation of the order-coexist, an interference of punishment is reasonable though
not inevitable. If the severance of service is effected the
first condition is fulfilled and if the foundation or causa
causans of such severance is the servant's misconduct, the
second is fulfilled. If the basis or foundation for the
order of termination is clearly not turpitudes or stigmatic
or rooted in misconduct or visited with evil pecuniary
effects, then the inference of dismissal stands negated and
vice versa. These canons run right through the disciplinary
branch of master and servant jurisprudence, both under
Article 311 and in other cases including workmen under
Managements. The law cannot’ be stultified by verbal
haberdashery because the Court will lift the mask and
discover the true face. [172 C-E]

Masters and servants cannot be permitted to play hide
and seek with the law of dismissals and the plain and proper
criteria are not to be misdirected by terminological coverups or by appeal to psychic processes but must be grounded
on the substantive reason for the order, whether disclosed
or undisclosed. The Court will find out from other
proceedings or documents connected with the formal order of
termination what the true ground for the termination is. If
thus scrutinised the; order has a punitive flavour in cause
or consequence, it is dismissal. If it falls short of this
test, it cannot be called a punishment. A_ termination
effected because the master is satisfied of the misconduct
and of the consequent desirability of terminating the
service of the delinquent servant, it is a dismissal even if
he had the right in law to terminate with an innocent order
under the standing order or otherwise. Whether, in such a
case the grounds are recorded in a different proceeding from
the formal order does not detract from its nature. Nor the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

fact that, after being satisfied of the guilt, the master
abandons the enquiry and proceeds to terminate. Given

149

an alleged misconduct and a live nexus between it and the
termination of service the conclusion is dismissal, even if
full benefits as on simple termination are given and noninjurious terminology is used. [173 E-H, 174 A]

On the contrary, even if there is suspicion of
misconduct, the master may say that he does not wish to
bother about it and may not go into his guilt but may feel
like not keeping a man he is not happy with. He may not like
to investigate nor take the risk of continuing a dubious
servant. There it is not n dismissal, but termination
simpliciter, if no injurious record of reasons or punitive
pecuniary cut back on his full terminal benefits is found.
For, in fact, misconduct is not then the moving factor in
the discharge, What is decisive is the plain reason for the
discharge, not the strategy of a non-enquiry or clever
avoidance of stigmatising epithets. If the basis is not
misconduct, the order is saved.

Every wrong order cannot be righted merely because it
was wrong. It can be quashed only if it is vitiated by the
fundamental flaws of gross miscarriage of justice, absence
of legal evidence, perverse misreading of facts, serious
errors of law on the face of the order, jurisdictional
failure and the like. [182 P-G]

While the remedy under Art. 226 is extraordinary and is
of Anglosaxon vintage, it is not a carbon copy of English
processes. Article 226 is a sparing surgery but the lancet
operates where injustice suppurates. While traditional
restraints like availability of alternative remedy hold back
the Court, and judicial power should not ordinarily rush in
where the other two branches fear to tread. judicial daring
is not daunted where’ glaring injustice demands even
affirmative action. The wide words of Article 226 are
designed for service of the lowly numbers in their
grievances if the subject belongs to the Court's province
and the remedy is appropriate to the judicial process. There
is a native hue about article 226, without being anglophilic
or anglophobic in attitude. Viewed from this jurisprudential
perspective the Court should be cautious both in not over

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

stepping as if Article 226 were as large as an appeal and
not failing to intervene where a grave error has crept in.

And an appellate power interferes not when the order
appealed is not right but only when it is dearly wrong. The
difference is real, though fine. [182 G-H, 183 A-B]

The principle of law is that the jurisdiction of the
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is limited
to holding the judicial or quasi judicial powers within the
leading sings of legality and to see that they do not exceed
their statutory jurisdiction and correctly administer the
law laid down by the statute under the Act. So long as the
hierarchy of officers and appellate authorities created by
the statute function within their ambit the manner in which
they do so can be no ground for interference. The power of
judicial supervision of the High Court under Article 227 of
tho Constitution (as it then stood) is not
150
greater than those under Article 226 and it must be limited
to seeing that a tribunal functions within the limits of its
authority. The writ power is large, given illegality and
injustice even if its use is severely disciplinary. The
amended Article 226 would enable the High Court to interfere
with an Award of the industrial adjudicator if that is based
on a complete misconception of law or it is based on no
evidence, or that no reasonable man would come to the
conclusion to which the Arbitrator has arrived. [15 E-G 1 86

"Tribunal" simpliciter has a sweeping signification and
does not exclude Arbitrator. A tribunal literally means a
seat of justice, may be, a commission, a Court or other
adjudicatory organ created by the State. All these are
tribunal and naturally the import of the word, in Section
2(r) of the Industrial Disputes Act, embraces an arbitration
tribunal. [188 E-F-H 189 A]

An Arbitrator has all the powers under the terms of

instant case, the Arbitrator had the authority to
investigate into the propriety of the discharge and the
veracity of the mis conduct. Even if section 11A of the

under Section 10A is bound to act in the spirit of the
legislation under which he is to function. A commercial
Arbitrator who derives his jurisdiction from the terms of
reference will by necessary implication be bound to decide
according to law and when one says “according to law", it
only means existing law and the law laid down by the Supreme
Court being the law of land, an Arbitrator under section 10A

Per Koshal J. (Contra)

1. The orders of discharge could not be regarded as
orders of their dismissal and were on the other hand, orders
of discharge simpliciter properly passed under Model
Standing order 23. [235 C-D]

(a) Clauses (3) and (4) of M.S.0. 25 speak of an
inquiry only in the case of an order falling under subclause (g) of clause (1) of that M.S.0. The only sub clause
of clause (1) of M.S.0. 25 to which the provisions of
clauses (3) and (4) of that M.S.0. would be attracted is sub
clause (g) and if an order of discharge falls under M.S.0.
23, an inquiry under clauses (3) and
151
(4) of M.S.0. 25 would not be a pre-requisite thereto even
though such an a older is mentioned in sub-clause (f) clause
(1) of that M.S.0. [222 H, 223 A]

(b) Under M.S.0.s. 23 and 25, the Management has the
powers to effect termination of the services of an employee
by having recourse to either or them. In action taken under
M.S.0. 23, no element of punishment is involved and the
discharge is a discharge simpliciter; and that is why no
opportunity to the concerned employee to show cause against
the termination is provided for. Dismissal, however, which
an employer may order is in its very nature, a punishment,
the infliction of which therefore has been made subject to
the result of an inquiry (having the semblance of a trial in
a criminal proceeding). Exercise of each of the two powers
has the effect of the termination of the services of the
concerned employee but must be regarded, because of the
Manner in which each has been dealt with by the M.S.0. as
separate and distinct from the other. [223 C-E]

(c) To contend that once it was proved that the order
of discharge of a workman was passed by reason of a
misconduct attributed to him by the management, the order
cannot but amount to an order of dismissal is wrong for two
reasons. For one thing, clause (1) of M.S.0. 25 specifically
states in sub-clauses (f) that a workman guilty of
misconduct may be discharged under M.S.0. 23. This clearly
means that when the employer is satisfied that a workman has
been guilty of misconduct he may [apart from visiting the
workman with any of the punishments specified in sub-clauses
(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of clause (1) of M.S.0. 25]

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

either pass against him an order of discharge for which no
inquiry precedent as, provided for in clauses (3) and (4) of
M.S.0. 25 would be necessary, or may dismiss him after
holding such an inquiry which of the two kinds of order, the
employer shall pass is left entirely to his discretion. [223
E-H]

It is true that the employer cannot pass a real order
of dismissal in the garb of one of discharge. But that only
means that if the order of termination of services of an
employee is in reality intended to push an employee and not
merely to get rid of him because he is considered useless,
inconvenient or troublesome, the order even though specified
to be an order of dismissal covered by sub clause (g) of
clause (1) of M.S.0. 25. On the other hand if no_- such
intention is made out the order would remain one of
discharge simpliciter even though it has been passed for the
sole reason that a misconduct is imputed to the employee.
That is how M.S.0s. 23 and 25 have to be interpreted. M.S.0.
25 specifically gives to the employer the power to get rid
of "a workman guilty of misconduct' by passing an order o
his discharge under M.S.0. 23. [224 A-D]

Secondly, the reasons for the termination of service o
a permanent workman under M.S.0. 23 have to be recorded in
writing and communicated to him if he so desires, under
clause (4-A) thereof. Such reasons must obviously consist o
an opinion derogatory to the workman in relation to the
performance of his duties, and whether such reasons consis
of negligence, work shirking or of serious overt acts like
theft or embezzlement, they would in and case amount to
misconduct for which he may be punished under M.S.0. 25.
There being no case in which such reasons would not amoun
to misconduct, the result is that M.S.0. 23 would be render
otiose if termination of service thereunder for misconduc
could be regarded as a dismissal and such a result strikes
at the very root of accepted canons of interpretation. If i
was open to the Court to. "lift
152
the veil" and to hold an order of discharge to amount to
dismissal merely because the motive behind it was a
misconduct attributed to the employee, the services of an
employee could be terminated without holding against him an
inquiry such as is contemplated by clauses (3) and (4) of
M.S.0. 25. [224 D-G]

Bombay Corporation v. Malvankar [1978] 3 SCR 1000;
applied.

Merely because it is the reason which weighed with the
employer in effective the termination of services would not
male the order of such termination as one founded on
misconduct, for such a proposition would run counter to the
plain meaning of clause (1) of M.S.0. 25. For an order to be
"founded" an misconduct, it must be intended to have been
passed by way of punishment, that is, it must be intended to
chastise, or cause pain in body or mind or harm or loss in

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

reputation or money to the concerned worker. If such an
intention cannot be spelled out of the _ prevailing
circumstances, the order of discharge or the reasons for
which it was ostensibly passed, it cannot be regarded as an
order of dismissal. Such would be the case when the employer
orders discharge or the interests of the factory or of the
general body of workers. [226 A-C]

Chartered Bank, Bombay v. The Chartered Bank Employees
Union, [1960] 3 SCR 441; The Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. [1964]

Office, Cinnamore v. Management , [1970] 2 L.L.J. 620
followed.

The real criterion which formed the touchstone of a
test to determine whether an order of termination of
services is an order of discharge simpliciter or amounts to
dismissal is the real nature of the order, that is, the
intention with which it was passed. If the intention was to
punish, that is to chastise, the order may be regarded as an
order of dismissal; and for judging the intention, the
question of mala fides (which is the same thing as
colourable exercise of power) becomes all important. If no
mala fides can be attributed to the management, the order of
discharge must be regarded as one having been passed under
M.S.0. 23 even though the reason for its passage is serious

misconduct.
(2) The arbitrator could not exercise tho power
conferred on a Tribunal under section 11A of the 1947 Act

and could not therefore interfere with the punishment
awarded by the Management to the workmen (even if the
discharge could be regarded a punishment). [235 D-E]

Throughout the I.D. Act, while ‘arbitrator' would
include an umpire, a Tribunal would not include an
arbitrator but would mean only an Industrial Tribunal
constituted under the Act unless the context makes it
necessary to give the word a different connotation. In sub
section (1) of section 11, the word 'Tribunal' has been used
in accordance with the definition appearing in clause (r)
section 2 because an arbitrator is separately mentioned in
that sub-section. In sub-sections (2) and (3) of that
section a Board, a Labour Court, a Tribunal and a National
Tribunal have been invested with certain powers. A Tribunal
as contemplated by sub-sections (2) and (3) then, would not
include an arbitrator. [233 A-B]

It is a well settled canon of interpretation of
statutes that the language used by the Legislature must be
regarded as the only source of its intention unless such
language is ambiguous, in which situation the Preamble to
the Act, the statement of objects of and Reasons for
bringing it on the statute book and
153
the purpose underlying the legislation may be taken into
consideration for ascertaining such intention. That the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

purpose of the legislation is to fulfil a socio-economic
need, or the express object underlying it does not come into
the picture till an ambiguity is detected in the language
and the Court must steer clear of the temptation to mould
the written word according to its own concept of what should
have been enacted. It is thus not permissible for the
Supreme Court to take the statements of objects and Reasons
or the purpose underlying the enactment into consideration,
while interpreting section 11A of the I.D. Act. [231 F-G,
234 CL

3. The High Court exceeded the limits of its
jurisdiction in interfering with the said punishment, in the
instant case, purporting to act in the exercise of its
powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. [235
E-F]

The High Court, while discharging its functions as
envisaged by that Article, does not sit as a Court of Appeal
over the Award of the Arbitrator but exercises limited
jurisdiction which extends only to seeing that the
arbitrator has functioned within the scope of his legal
authority. In this view of the matter it was not open to the
High Court to revise the punishment (if the discharge is
regarded as such) meted out by the Management to the
delinquent workmen and left intact by the arbitrator whose
authority in doing so has not been shown to have been
exercised beyond the limits of his jurisdiction. [234 G-E,

KRISHNA IYER, J.-Every litigation has a moral and, these appeals have many, the foremost being
that the economics of law is the essence of labour jurisprudence.

The case in a nutshell
An affluent Management and an indigent work force are the two wings of the Gujarat Steel Tubes
Ltd. which manufactures steel tubes in the outskirts of Anmedabad city and is scarred by an
industrial dispute resulting in these appeals. This industry, started in 1960, went into production
since 1964 and waggled from infancy to adulthood with smiling profits and growing workers,
punctuated by smouldering demand, strikes and settlements, until there brewed a confrontation
culminating in a head-on collision following upon certain unhappy happenings. A total strike
ensued, whose chain reaction was a wholesale termination of all the employees, followed by fresh
recruitment of workmen, de facto breakdown of the strike and dispute over restoration of the
removed workmen. This cataclysmic episode and its sequel formed the basis of a Section 10A
arbitration and award, a writ petition and judgment, inevitably spiralling up to this Court in two
appeals one by the Management and the other by the Union-which have been heard together and
are being disposed of by this common judgment. The arbitrator held the action of the Management
warranted while the High Court reversed the Award and substantially directed reinstatement.

The Judge Perspective A few fundamental issues, factual and legal, on which bitter controversy
raged at the bar, settle the decisional fate of this case. A plethora of precedents has been cited and
volumes of evidence read for our consideration by both sides. But the jural resolution of labour
disputes must be sought in the law-life complex, beyond the factual blinkers of decided cases,
beneath the lexical littleness of statutory texts, in the economic basics of industrial justice which
must enliven the consciousness of the court and the corpus juris. This Court has developed Labour
Law on this road basis and what this Court has declared holds good for the country. We must first
fix the founding faith in this juristic branch before unravelling the details of the particular case.

Viewing from this vantage point, it is relevant to note that the ethical roots of jurisprudence, with
economic overtones, are the clan vital of any country's legal system. So it is that we begin with two
quotations-one from the old Testament and the other from Gandhiji, the Indian New Testament-as
perspective-setters. After all, industrial law must set the moral-legal norms for the modus vivendi
between the partners in management, namely, Capital and Labour. Cain reported, when asked by
God about his brother Abel, in the Old Testament: 'Am I my brother's keeper ?', 'Yes' was the
implicit answer in God's curse of Cain. In the fraternal economics of national production, worker is
partner in this biblical spirit. In our society, Capital shall be the brother and keeper of Labour and
cannot disown this obligation, especially because Social Justice and Articles 43 and 43A are
constitutional mandates.

HEADNOTE:
The appellant manufactures steel tubes in the outskirts
of Ahmedabad city. It started its business in 1960, went

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

into production since 1964 and waggled from infancy to
adulthood with smiling profits and growling workers,
punctuated by smouldering demands, strikes and settlement
until there brewed a confrontation culminating in a head-on
collision following upon certain unhappy happenings. A total
strike ensued whose chain reaction was a_ whole-sale
termination of all employees followed by fresh recruitment
of workmen defacto breakdown of the strike and dispute over
restoration of the removed workmen.

As per the last settlement between the management and
the workmen of 4th August, 1972, it was not open to the
workmen to resort to a strike till the expiry of a period of
five years; nor could the management declare a lock out till
then. Any dispute arising between the parties, according to
the terms arrived at were to be sorted out through
negotiation or, failing that by recourse to arbitration. The
matter was therefore, referred to an arbitrator and the
arbitrator by his award held the action cf the management
warranted. The respondent challenged the decision of the
arbitrator under Article 226/227 of the Constitution and the
High Court of Gujarat reversed the award and substantially
directed reinstatement. Hence the appeals both by the
Management and the workmen.

Dismissing the appeals and modifying the awards
substantially, the Court

HELD: (By Majority)

Per Iyer J. On behalf of D. A. Desai J. and himself.

(i) The basic assumption is that the strike was not
only illegal but also unjustified. [210 H]

147

(ii) The management did punish its 853 workmen when it
discharged them for reasons of misconduct set out in
separate but integrated proceedings; even though with legal
finesse, the formal order was phrased in harmless verbalism.

[211 A]
(iii) The action taken under the general law or the
standing orders, was illegal in the absence of

individualised charge sheets, proper hearing and personalise
punishment if found guilty. None of these steps having been
taken, the discharge orders were still born. But, the
Management could, as in this case it did, offer to make out
the delinquency of the employees and the arbitrator had, in
such cases, the full jurisdiction to adjudge de novo both
guilt and punishment. [211 B-C]

(iv) Section 11A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
does take in an arbitrator too, and in this case, the

arbitral reference, apart from section 11A is plenary in
scope. [211 C-D]
(v) Article 226 of the Constitution, however

restrictive in practice Is a power wide enough in all
conscience, to be a friend in need when the summons comes in
a crisis froma victim of injustice; and more importantly

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

this extra-ordinary reserve power is unsheathed to grant
final relief without necessary recourse to a remand. What
the Tribunal may in its discretion do the High Court too
under Article 226, can, if facts compel so. [211 D-E]

(vi) The Award, in the instant case, suffers froma
fundamental flaw that it equates an illegal and unjustified
strike with brozen misconduct by every workman without so
much as identification of the charge against each, after
adverting to the gravamen of his misconduct meriting
dismissal. Passive participation in a strike which is both
illegal and unjustified does not ipso facto invite dismissal
or punitive discharge. There must be active individual
excess such as master-minding the unjustified aspects of the
strike, e.g., violence, sabotage or other reprehensible
role. Absent such gravamen in the accusation, the extreme
economic penalty of discharge is wrong. An indicator of the
absence of such grievous guilt is that the management, after
stating in strong terms all the sins of workmen, took back
over 400 of them as they trickled back slowly and beyond the
time set, with continuity of service, suggestive of the
dubiety of the inflated accusations and awareness of the
minor role of the mass of workmen in the lingering strike.
Furthermore, even though all sanctions short of punitive
discharge may be employed by a Management, low wages and
high cost of living, dismissal of several hundreds with
disastrous impact on numerous families is of such sensitive
social concern that, save in exceptional situations, the law
will inhibit such a lethal step for the peace of the
industry, the welfare of the workmen and the broader justice
that transcends transcient disputes. The human dimensions
have decisional relevance. The discharge orders though
approved by the Arbitrator are invalid. [211 E-H, 212 A-B]

HELD FURTHER: 1. In a society, capital shall be the
brother and keeper of labour and cannot disown this
obligation of a partner in management, especially because
social justice and Articles 43 and 43A are constitutional
Mandates. The policy directions in Articles 39, 41, 42, 43
and 43A speak af the right to an adequate means of
livelihood, the right to work, humane conditions of work,
living wages ensuring a decent standard of life and
enjoyment of leisure and participation of workers in
Management of industries. De hors these
148
Mandates, law will fail functionally. Suck is the value
vision of Indian Industrial Jurisprudence. [155 B, G-H, 156
A]

2. Jural resolution of labour disputes must be sought
in the law life complex beyond the factual blinkers of
decided cases, beneath the lexical littleness of statutory
tests, in the economic basics of industrial justice which
must enliven the consciousness of the Court and the corpus
juris. [154 F-G]

The golden rule for the judicial resolution of an

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

industrial dispute is first to persuade fighting parties, by
judicious suggestions, into the  peace-making zone,
disentangle the differences, narrow the mistrust gap and
convert them through consensual steps, into negotiated
justice. Law is not the last word in justice, especially
social justice. Moreover in an hierarchical system, the
little man lives in the short run but most litigation lives
in the long run. So it is that negotiation first and
adjudication next, is a welcome formula for the Bench and
the Bar, the Management and Union. [157 C-E]

The anatomy of a dismissal order is not a mystery, once
it is agreed that substance, not semblance, governs the
decision. Legal criteria are not so slippery that verbal
Manipulations may outwit the Court. The fact is the index of
the mind and an order fair on its face may be taken at its
face value. But there is more to it than that, because
sometimes words are designed to conceal deeds by linguistic
engineering. The form of the order of the language in which
it is couched is not conclusive. The Court will lift the
veil to see the the nature of the order. [171 G-H. 172 A]

If two factors-motive and foundation of the order-coexist, an interference of punishment is reasonable though
not inevitable. If the severance of service is effected the
first condition is fulfilled and if the foundation or causa
causans of such severance is the servant's misconduct, the
second is fulfilled. If the basis or foundation for the
order of termination is clearly not turpitudes or stigmatic
or rooted in misconduct or visited with evil pecuniary
effects, then the inference of dismissal stands negated and
vice versa. These canons run right through the disciplinary
branch of master and servant jurisprudence, both under
Article 311 and in other cases including workmen under
Managements. The law cannot’ be stultified by verbal
haberdashery because the Court will lift the mask and
discover the true face. [172 C-E]

Masters and servants cannot be permitted to play hide
and seek with the law of dismissals and the plain and proper
criteria are not to be misdirected by terminological coverups or by appeal to psychic processes but must be grounded
on the substantive reason for the order, whether disclosed
or undisclosed. The Court will find out from other
proceedings or documents connected with the formal order of
termination what the true ground for the termination is. If
thus scrutinised the; order has a punitive flavour in cause
or consequence, it is dismissal. If it falls short of this
test, it cannot be called a punishment. A_ termination
effected because the master is satisfied of the misconduct
and of the consequent desirability of terminating the
service of the delinquent servant, it is a dismissal even if
he had the right in law to terminate with an innocent order
under the standing order or otherwise. Whether, in such a
case the grounds are recorded in a different proceeding from
the formal order does not detract from its nature. Nor the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

fact that, after being satisfied of the guilt, the master
abandons the enquiry and proceeds to terminate. Given

149

an alleged misconduct and a live nexus between it and the
termination of service the conclusion is dismissal, even if
full benefits as on simple termination are given and noninjurious terminology is used. [173 E-H, 174 A]

On the contrary, even if there is suspicion of
misconduct, the master may say that he does not wish to
bother about it and may not go into his guilt but may feel
like not keeping a man he is not happy with. He may not like
to investigate nor take the risk of continuing a dubious
servant. There it is not n dismissal, but termination
simpliciter, if no injurious record of reasons or punitive
pecuniary cut back on his full terminal benefits is found.
For, in fact, misconduct is not then the moving factor in
the discharge, What is decisive is the plain reason for the
discharge, not the strategy of a non-enquiry or clever
avoidance of stigmatising epithets. If the basis is not
misconduct, the order is saved.

Every wrong order cannot be righted merely because it
was wrong. It can be quashed only if it is vitiated by the
fundamental flaws of gross miscarriage of justice, absence
of legal evidence, perverse misreading of facts, serious
errors of law on the face of the order, jurisdictional
failure and the like. [182 P-G]

While the remedy under Art. 226 is extraordinary and is
of Anglosaxon vintage, it is not a carbon copy of English
processes. Article 226 is a sparing surgery but the lancet
operates where injustice suppurates. While traditional
restraints like availability of alternative remedy hold back
the Court, and judicial power should not ordinarily rush in
where the other two branches fear to tread. judicial daring
is not daunted where’ glaring injustice demands even
affirmative action. The wide words of Article 226 are
designed for service of the lowly numbers in their
grievances if the subject belongs to the Court's province
and the remedy is appropriate to the judicial process. There
is a native hue about article 226, without being anglophilic
or anglophobic in attitude. Viewed from this jurisprudential
perspective the Court should be cautious both in not over

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

stepping as if Article 226 were as large as an appeal and
not failing to intervene where a grave error has crept in.

And an appellate power interferes not when the order
appealed is not right but only when it is dearly wrong. The
difference is real, though fine. [182 G-H, 183 A-B]

The principle of law is that the jurisdiction of the
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is limited
to holding the judicial or quasi judicial powers within the
leading sings of legality and to see that they do not exceed
their statutory jurisdiction and correctly administer the
law laid down by the statute under the Act. So long as the
hierarchy of officers and appellate authorities created by
the statute function within their ambit the manner in which
they do so can be no ground for interference. The power of
judicial supervision of the High Court under Article 227 of
tho Constitution (as it then stood) is not
150
greater than those under Article 226 and it must be limited
to seeing that a tribunal functions within the limits of its
authority. The writ power is large, given illegality and
injustice even if its use is severely disciplinary. The
amended Article 226 would enable the High Court to interfere
with an Award of the industrial adjudicator if that is based
on a complete misconception of law or it is based on no
evidence, or that no reasonable man would come to the
conclusion to which the Arbitrator has arrived. [15 E-G 1 86

"Tribunal" simpliciter has a sweeping signification and
does not exclude Arbitrator. A tribunal literally means a
seat of justice, may be, a commission, a Court or other
adjudicatory organ created by the State. All these are
tribunal and naturally the import of the word, in Section
2(r) of the Industrial Disputes Act, embraces an arbitration
tribunal. [188 E-F-H 189 A]

Dawking v. Rokely, L.R. 8 Q.B. 255; quoted with

An Arbitrator has all the powers under the terms of
reference, to which both sides are party, confer. In the

instant case, the Arbitrator had the authority to
investigate into the propriety of the discharge and the
veracity of the mis conduct. Even if section 11A of the

Industrial Disputes Act is not applicable, an Arbitrator

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

under Section 10A is bound to act in the spirit of the
legislation under which he is to function. A commercial
Arbitrator who derives his jurisdiction from the terms of
reference will by necessary implication be bound to decide
according to law and when one says “according to law", it
only means existing law and the law laid down by the Supreme
Court being the law of land, an Arbitrator under section 10A
will have to decide keeping in view the spirit of section
11A. [196 B-D]

Per Koshal J. (Contra)

1. The orders of discharge could not be regarded as
orders of their dismissal and were on the other hand, orders
of discharge simpliciter properly passed under Model
Standing order 23. [235 C-D]

(a) Clauses (3) and (4) of M.S.0. 25 speak of an
inquiry only in the case of an order falling under subclause (g) of clause (1) of that M.S.0. The only sub clause
of clause (1) of M.S.0. 25 to which the provisions of
clauses (3) and (4) of that M.S.0. would be attracted is sub
clause (g) and if an order of discharge falls under M.S.0.
23, an inquiry under clauses (3) and
151
(4) of M.S.0. 25 would not be a pre-requisite thereto even
though such an a older is mentioned in sub-clause (f) clause
(1) of that M.S.0. [222 H, 223 A]

(b) Under M.S.0.s. 23 and 25, the Management has the
powers to effect termination of the services of an employee
by having recourse to either or them. In action taken under
M.S.0. 23, no element of punishment is involved and the
discharge is a discharge simpliciter; and that is why no
opportunity to the concerned employee to show cause against
the termination is provided for. Dismissal, however, which
an employer may order is in its very nature, a punishment,
the infliction of which therefore has been made subject to
the result of an inquiry (having the semblance of a trial in
a criminal proceeding). Exercise of each of the two powers
has the effect of the termination of the services of the
concerned employee but must be regarded, because of the
Manner in which each has been dealt with by the M.S.0. as
separate and distinct from the other. [223 C-E]

(c) To contend that once it was proved that the order
of discharge of a workman was passed by reason of a
misconduct attributed to him by the management, the order
cannot but amount to an order of dismissal is wrong for two
reasons. For one thing, clause (1) of M.S.0. 25 specifically
states in sub-clauses (f) that a workman guilty of
misconduct may be discharged under M.S.0. 23. This clearly
means that when the employer is satisfied that a workman has
been guilty of misconduct he may [apart from visiting the
workman with any of the punishments specified in sub-clauses
(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of clause (1) of M.S.0. 25]

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

either pass against him an order of discharge for which no
inquiry precedent as, provided for in clauses (3) and (4) of
M.S.0. 25 would be necessary, or may dismiss him after
holding such an inquiry which of the two kinds of order, the
employer shall pass is left entirely to his discretion. [223
E-H]

It is true that the employer cannot pass a real order
of dismissal in the garb of one of discharge. But that only
means that if the order of termination of services of an
employee is in reality intended to push an employee and not
merely to get rid of him because he is considered useless,
inconvenient or troublesome, the order even though specified
to be an order of dismissal covered by sub clause (g) of
clause (1) of M.S.0. 25. On the other hand if no_- such
intention is made out the order would remain one of
discharge simpliciter even though it has been passed for the
sole reason that a misconduct is imputed to the employee.
That is how M.S.0s. 23 and 25 have to be interpreted. M.S.0.
25 specifically gives to the employer the power to get rid
of "a workman guilty of misconduct' by passing an order o
his discharge under M.S.0. 23. [224 A-D]

Secondly, the reasons for the termination of service o
a permanent workman under M.S.0. 23 have to be recorded in
writing and communicated to him if he so desires, under
clause (4-A) thereof. Such reasons must obviously consist o
an opinion derogatory to the workman in relation to the
performance of his duties, and whether such reasons consis
of negligence, work shirking or of serious overt acts like
theft or embezzlement, they would in and case amount to
misconduct for which he may be punished under M.S.0. 25.
There being no case in which such reasons would not amoun
to misconduct, the result is that M.S.0. 23 would be render
otiose if termination of service thereunder for misconduc
could be regarded as a dismissal and such a result strikes
at the very root of accepted canons of interpretation. If i
was open to the Court to. "lift
152
the veil" and to hold an order of discharge to amount to
dismissal merely because the motive behind it was a
misconduct attributed to the employee, the services of an
employee could be terminated without holding against him an
inquiry such as is contemplated by clauses (3) and (4) of
M.S.0. 25. [224 D-G]

Bombay Corporation v. Malvankar [1978] 3 SCR 1000;
applied.

Merely because it is the reason which weighed with the
employer in effective the termination of services would not
male the order of such termination as one founded on
misconduct, for such a proposition would run counter to the
plain meaning of clause (1) of M.S.0. 25. For an order to be
"founded" an misconduct, it must be intended to have been
passed by way of punishment, that is, it must be intended to
chastise, or cause pain in body or mind or harm or loss in

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

reputation or money to the concerned worker. If such an
intention cannot be spelled out of the _ prevailing
circumstances, the order of discharge or the reasons for
which it was ostensibly passed, it cannot be regarded as an
order of dismissal. Such would be the case when the employer
orders discharge or the interests of the factory or of the
general body of workers. [226 A-C]

followed.

The real criterion which formed the touchstone of a
test to determine whether an order of termination of
services is an order of discharge simpliciter or amounts to
dismissal is the real nature of the order, that is, the
intention with which it was passed. If the intention was to
punish, that is to chastise, the order may be regarded as an
order of dismissal; and for judging the intention, the
question of mala fides (which is the same thing as
colourable exercise of power) becomes all important. If no
mala fides can be attributed to the management, the order of
discharge must be regarded as one having been passed under
M.S.0. 23 even though the reason for its passage is serious

misconduct.
(2) The arbitrator could not exercise tho power
conferred on a Tribunal under section 11A of the 1947 Act

and could not therefore interfere with the punishment
awarded by the Management to the workmen (even if the
discharge could be regarded a punishment). [235 D-E]

Throughout the I.D. Act, while ‘arbitrator' would
include an umpire, a Tribunal would not include an
arbitrator but would mean only an Industrial Tribunal
constituted under the Act unless the context makes it
necessary to give the word a different connotation. In sub
section (1) of section 11, the word 'Tribunal' has been used
in accordance with the definition appearing in clause (r)
section 2 because an arbitrator is separately mentioned in
that sub-section. In sub-sections (2) and (3) of that
section a Board, a Labour Court, a Tribunal and a National
Tribunal have been invested with certain powers. A Tribunal
as contemplated by sub-sections (2) and (3) then, would not
include an arbitrator. [233 A-B]

It is a well settled canon of interpretation of
statutes that the language used by the Legislature must be
regarded as the only source of its intention unless such
language is ambiguous, in which situation the Preamble to
the Act, the statement of objects of and Reasons for
bringing it on the statute book and
153
the purpose underlying the legislation may be taken into
consideration for ascertaining such intention. That the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

purpose of the legislation is to fulfil a socio-economic
need, or the express object underlying it does not come into
the picture till an ambiguity is detected in the language
and the Court must steer clear of the temptation to mould
the written word according to its own concept of what should
have been enacted. It is thus not permissible for the
Supreme Court to take the statements of objects and Reasons
or the purpose underlying the enactment into consideration,
while interpreting section 11A of the I.D. Act. [231 F-G,
234 CL

3. The High Court exceeded the limits of its
jurisdiction in interfering with the said punishment, in the
instant case, purporting to act in the exercise of its
powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. [235
E-F]

The High Court, while discharging its functions as
envisaged by that Article, does not sit as a Court of Appeal
over the Award of the Arbitrator but exercises limited
jurisdiction which extends only to seeing that the
arbitrator has functioned within the scope of his legal
authority. In this view of the matter it was not open to the
High Court to revise the punishment (if the discharge is
regarded as such) meted out by the Management to the
delinquent workmen and left intact by the arbitrator whose
authority in doing so has not been shown to have been
exercised beyond the limits of his jurisdiction. [234 G-E,

KRISHNA IYER, J.-Every litigation has a moral and, these appeals have many, the foremost being
that the economics of law is the essence of labour jurisprudence.

The case in a nutshell
An affluent Management and an indigent work force are the two wings of the Gujarat Steel Tubes
Ltd. which manufactures steel tubes in the outskirts of Anmedabad city and is scarred by an
industrial dispute resulting in these appeals. This industry, started in 1960, went into production
since 1964 and waggled from infancy to adulthood with smiling profits and growing workers,
punctuated by smouldering demand, strikes and settlements, until there brewed a confrontation
culminating in a head-on collision following upon certain unhappy happenings. A total strike
ensued, whose chain reaction was a wholesale termination of all the employees, followed by fresh
recruitment of workmen, de facto breakdown of the strike and dispute over restoration of the
removed workmen. This cataclysmic episode and its sequel formed the basis of a Section 10A
arbitration and award, a writ petition and judgment, inevitably spiralling up to this Court in two
appeals one by the Management and the other by the Union-which have been heard together and
are being disposed of by this common judgment. The arbitrator held the action of the Management
warranted while the High Court reversed the Award and substantially directed reinstatement.

The Judge Perspective A few fundamental issues, factual and legal, on which bitter controversy
raged at the bar, settle the decisional fate of this case. A plethora of precedents has been cited and
volumes of evidence read for our consideration by both sides. But the jural resolution of labour
disputes must be sought in the law-life complex, beyond the factual blinkers of decided cases,
beneath the lexical littleness of statutory texts, in the economic basics of industrial justice which
must enliven the consciousness of the court and the corpus juris. This Court has developed Labour
Law on this road basis and what this Court has declared holds good for the country. We must first
fix the founding faith in this juristic branch before unravelling the details of the particular case.

Viewing from this vantage point, it is relevant to note that the ethical roots of jurisprudence, with
economic overtones, are the clan vital of any country's legal system. So it is that we begin with two
quotations-one from the old Testament and the other from Gandhiji, the Indian New Testament-as
perspective-setters. After all, industrial law must set the moral-legal norms for the modus vivendi
between the partners in management, namely, Capital and Labour. Cain reported, when asked by
God about his brother Abel, in the Old Testament: 'Am I my brother's keeper ?', 'Yes' was the
implicit answer in God's curse of Cain. In the fraternal economics of national production, worker is
partner in this biblical spirit. In our society, Capital shall be the brother and keeper of Labour and
cannot disown this obligation, especially because Social Justice and Articles 43 and 43A are
constitutional mandates.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 11Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

Gandhiji, to whom the Arbitrator has adverted in passing in his award, way back in March 1946,
wrote on Capitalism and Strikes h the Harijan:

"How should capital behave when labour strikes ? This question is in the air and has great
importance at the present moment. One way is that of suppression named or nicknamed 'American’.
It consists in suppression of labour through organised goondaism. Everybody would consider this as
wrong and destructive. The other way, right and honorable, consists in considering every strike on
its merits and giving labour its due-not what capital considers as due, but what labour itself would
so consider and enlightened public opinion acclaims as just.

In my opinion, employers and employed are equal partners, even if employees are not considered
superior. But what we see today is the reverse. The reason is that the employers harness intelligence
on their side. They have the superior advantage which concentration of capital brings with it, and
they know how to make use of it...... Whilst capital in India is fairly organised, labour is strike in a
more or less disorganised condition in spite of Unions and Federation. Therefore, it lacks the power
that true combination gives.

Hence, my advice to the employers would be that should willingly regard workers as the real owners
of the concerns which they fancy they have created.

Tuned to these values are the policy directives in Articles 39, 41, 42, 43 and 43A. They speak of the
right to an adequate means of livelihood, the right to work, humane conditions of work, living wage
ensuring a decent standard of life and enjoyment of leisure and participation of workers in
management of industries. De hors these man
dates, law will fail functionally. Such is the value-vision of Indian Industrial Jurisprudence.

The Matrix of facts-A Pre-view The nidus of facts which enwomb the issues of law may be elaborated
a little more at this stage. In the vicinity of Ahmedabad City, the appellant is a prosperous
engineering enterprise which enjoys entrepreneureal excellence and employs over 800 workmen
knit together into the respondent Union called the Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha (the Sabha,
for short). Fortunately, the industry has had an innings of escalating profits but the workmen have
had a running complaint a raw deal. Frequent demands for better conditions, followed by negotiated
settlements, have been a lovely feature of this establishment, although the poignant fact remains
that till the dawn of the seventies, the gross wages of the workmen have hovered round a harrowing
hundred rupees or more in this thriving Ahmedabad industry.

The course of this precarious co-existence was often ruffled, and there was, now and then, some
flare-up leading to strike, conciliation and even reference under Section 10. When one such
reference was pending another unconnected dispute arose which, alter some twists and turns, led to
an industrial break-down and a total strike. The episodic stages of this bitter battle will have to be
narrated at length a little later. Suffice it to say that the Management jettisoned all the 853 workman
and recruited some fresher to take their place and to keep the wheels of production moving. In the
war of attrition that ensued, labour lost and capitulated to Capital. At long last, between the two, a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 42Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

reference to arbitration of the disputes was agreed upon under Section 10A of the Industrial
Disputes Act 1947 (the Act, for short). The highlight of the dispute referred for arbitration was
whether the termination orders issued by the Management against the workmen whose names were
set out in the annexure to the reference were "legal, proper and justified"; if not, whether the
workmen were ‘entitled to any reliefs including the relief of reinstatement with continuity of service
and full back wages’. The arbitrator's decision went against the Sabha while, on a challenge under
Article 226, the High Court's judgment virtually vindicated its stand. This is the hang of the case.
The substantial appeal is by the Management while the Sabha has a marginal quarrel over a portion
of the judgment as disclosed in its appeal. The 'jetsam' workmen, a few hundred in number, have
been directed to be reinstated with full or partial back pay and this is the bitter bone of contention.

A stage-by-stage recapitulation of the developments is important to get to grips with the core
controversy.

Sri Ashok Sen, for the appellant-Management, and Sri Tarkunde for the respondent-Sabha, have
extensively presented their rival versions with forceful erudition. Sri R.K. Garg, of course, for some
workmen has invoked with passion the socialist thrust of the Constitution as a substantive
submission and, as justificatory of the workmen's demands, relied on the glaring contrast between
the soaring profits and the sagging wages, while Sri Bhandare has pressed the lachrymose case of
the several hundreds of 'interregnal' employees whose removal from service, on reinstatement of the
old, might spell iniquity.

Olive Branch Approach: At this stage we must disclose an effort at settlement we made with the
hearty participation of Sri Ashok Sen and Sri Tarkunde at the early stages of the hearing.

The golden rule for the judicial resolution of an industrial dispute is first to persuade fighting
parties, by judicious suggestions, into the peace-making zone, disentangle the differences, narrow
the mistrust gap and convert them, through consensual steps, into negotiated justice. Law is not the
last word in justice, especially social justice. Moreover, in our hierarchical court system the little
man lives in the short run but most litigation lives in the long run. So it is that negotiation first and
adjudication next, is a welcome formula for the Bench and the Bar, Management and Union. This
‘olive Branch’ approach brought the parties closer in our court and gave use a better understanding
of the problem, although we could not clinch a settlement. So we heard the case in depth and felt
that some of the legal issues did merit this court's declaratory pronouncement, settlement or no
settlement. Mercifully, counsel abbreviated their oral arguments into an eight-day exercise, sparing
us the sparring marathon of 28 laborious days through which the case stretched out in the High
Court.

Orality ad libitem may be the genius of Victorian era advocacy but in our 'needy' Republic with
crowded dockets, forensic brevity is a necessity. The Bench and the Bar. must fabricate a new
shorthand form of court methodology which will do justice to the pockets of the poor who seek right
and justice and to the limited judicial hours humanly available to the court if the delivery system of
justice is not to suffer obsolescence.

The facts: Back to the central facts. Proof of the 'efficient’' management of the Gujarat Steel Tubes
Ltd. is afforded by the testimony of larger turnover and profits, year after year, from the beginning
down to date. The mill was commissioned in January 1964 but by the accounting year 1971-72 the
turnover had leapt to Rs. 560 lakhs. It scaled to Rs. 680 lakhs the next year, to Rs. 1136 lakhs the
year after and to Rs. 20 crores in 1974-75. This enterprise entered the export trade and otherwise
established itself as a premier manufactory in the line. Steel shortage is the only shackle which
hampers its higher productivity. But its increasing shower of prosperity was a sharp contrast,
according to Sri Garg, to the share of the wage bill. The worker star ted on a magnificent sum per
mensem of Rs. 100/- in toto even as late as 1970, although some workmen, with more service, were
paid some what higher. The extenuatory plea of the Management, justificatory of this parsimony,
was that other mill-hands were receiving more niggardly wages in comparable enterprises.
Probably, unionisation, under these luridly low-paid circumstances, caught on and a workers' union
was born somewhere around 1966. A sensible stroke of enlightened capitalism persuaded the
Management to enter into agreements with the Union, somewhat improving emoluments and
ameliorating conditions. By 1968, the Sabha, a later union, came into being and commanded the
backing of all or most of the mill-hands. By March 1969, the Sabha presented a charter of demands,
followed by resistance from the Management and strike by the workers. By July 1969, a settlement
with the Sabha was reached. Agreements relating to the various demands brought quiet and respite
to the industry although it proved temporary.

A vivid close-up of the sequence and consequence of the dramatic and traumatic events culminating
in the reference to arbitration and the impugned award is essential as factual foundation for the
decision of the issues. Even so, we must condense, since labyrinthine details are not needed in a
third tier judgment. Broad lines with the brush bring out the effect, not minute etches which
encumber the picture.

An agreement of futuristic import with which we may begin the confrontational chronicle is that of
April 1970. Clause 6 thereof runs thus:

"Management of the Company agrees to implement recommendations of the Central
Wage Board for Engineering Industries as and when finally declared and all the
increments granted to workmen from time to time under this agreement shall be
adjusted with those recommendations provided that such adjustment shall not
adversely affect the wages of workman."

The engineering industry, where India is forging ahead, was apparently exploitative towards labour,
and to make amends for this un
healthy position, the Central Wage Board was appointed in 1964 although it took six long years to
recommend revision of wages to be implemented with effect from 1-1-1969. Meanwhile, the masses
of workers were living 'below the broad line’ Saintly patience in such a milieu was too much to
expect from hungry demands and pressing for the recommendations of the Wage Board to be
converted into immediate cash. But, as we will presently unravel, Wage Board expectations’ were
proving teasing illusions and premises of unreality because of non-implementation, viewed from the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 14Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

Sabha's angle. The Management, on the other hand, had a contrary version which we will briefly
consider. Luckily, agreed mini-increases in wages were taking place during the years 1970, 1971 and
1972. Likewise, bonus was also the subject of bargain and agreement. But in September 1971, an
allegedly violent episode broke up the truce between the two, spawned criminal cases against
workers, led to charges of go-slow tactics and lock-outs and burst into suspension, discharge and
dismissal of workmen.

The crisis was tided over by continued conciliations and two settlements. We are not directly
concerned with the cluster of clauses therein save one. 64 workmen had been discharged or
dismissed, of whom half the number were agreed to be reinstated. The fate of the other half (32
workers) was left for arbitration by the Industrial Tribunal. The dark clouds cleared for a while but
the sky turned murky over again, although the previous agreement had promised a long spell of
normalcy. The Sabha, in October 1972, met and resolved to raise demands of which the principal
ones were non-implementation of the Wage Board recommendations, bonus for 1971 and wages
during the lockout period. The primary pathology of industrial friction is attitudinal. The
Management could have (and, indeed, did, with a new Union) solved these problems had they
regarded the Sabha as partner, not saboteur. Had the bitter combativeness of the Sabha been
moderated, may be the showdown could have been averted.

Apportioning blame does not help now, but we refer to it here because Sri Ashok Sen, with feeling
fury, fell foul of the criticism by the High Court that the Management had acted improperly in
insisting on arbitration, and argued that when parties disagreed, arbitral reference was the only
answer and the workers' fanatical rejection of arbitration made no sense We need not delve into the
details of the correspondence relied on by either side to reach the truth. For, the Unions case is that
in the prior settlement between the two parties arbitral reference came only after negotiations failed.
That was why they pressed the Management to reason together, avoiding wrestling with each other
before a slow-moving umpire.

Sri Tarkunde, for the Sabha, urged that the workmen were not intransigent but impatient and
pleaded for a negotiated settlement since the main point in dispute, namely the implementation of
the Central Engineering Wage Board's recommendations, was too plain to admit of difference, given
good faith on both sides. We will examine the substance of this submission later but it needs to be
emphasised that workmen, surviving on starving wages and with notoriously fragile staying power,
are in no mood for adjudicatory procedures, arbitral or other, if the doors of negotiation are still
ajar. The obvious reason for this attitude is that the litigative length of the adjudicatory apparatus,
be it the tribunal, the court or the arbitrator, is too lethargic and long-winded for workmen without
the wherewithal to survive and is beset with protracted challenges either by way of appeal upon
appeal or in the shape of writ petitions and, thereafter, appeals upon appeals. The present case
illustrates the point. Where workmen on hundred rupees a month demand immediate negotiation
the reason is that privations have no patience beyond a point. Now and here, by negotiation, is the
shop- floor glamour. In this very matter, although the controversy before the arbitrator fell within a
small compass, he took a year and ninety printed pages to decide, inevitably followed by a few Years
and hundred and thirty printed pages of judgment in the High Court and a longer spell in this Court
with slightly lesser length of judgment. Which workman under Third World Conditions can

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 15Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

withstand this wasting disease while hunger leaves no option save to do or die ? Raw life, not rigid
logic, is the mother of law.

After the demands were raised by the Union, the main issue being implementation of the Wage
Board recommendations, a stream of correspondence, meetings and inchoate settlements ensued,
but the crucial question, which would have meant 'cash and carry' for the workmen, baffled solution.
Do negotiate since the application of the Wage Board recommendations are beyond ambiguity, was
the Sabha's peremptory plea. We differ; therefore, go to arbitration, was the Management's firm
response. A stalemate descended on the scene.

No breakthrough being visible, the Sabha charged the Management by its letter of January 25, 1973
with breach of clause 6 of the Agreement of August 4, 1972 which ran thus:

"That the parties agree that for a period of 5 years from the date of this settlement all
disputes will be solved by mutual negotiations or, failing that, by joint arbitration
under Section 10A of the I.D. Act, 1947. Neither party shall take any direct action
including go-slow, strike and lock-out for a period of 5 years from the date of this
settlement."

Various aspersions of anti-labour tactics were included in the Sabha's letter but the most
money-loaded item was the grievance about the Wage Board recommendations. The temper, by
now, was tense.

The Management, on the same day, (January 25, 1973) set out its version on the notice board and
the High Court's summary of it runs thus .

"The notice stated that during the course of the meeting with the representatives of
the Sabha held on January 20, 1973 the Company had expressed its willingness to
implement the Wage Board recommendations according to its interpretation on and
with effect from January 1, 1969 without prejudice to the rights and contentions of
the workmen and leaving it open to the parties to take the matter to arbitration for
resolution of the points of dispute. The Sabha, however, had turned down this
suggestion and it came to the notice of the Company that workmen were being
instigated by making false representations. The Company clarified that on and with
effect from January 1, 1972 every workman would be entitled to the benefits of Wage
Board recommendations, irrespective of whether the concerned workman had put in
240 days attendance."

The Sabha's answer was a strike two days later. This event of January 27 was countered quickly by
the Management restating its attitude on the Wage Board recommendations, asserting that the
strike was illegal and in breach of the settlement of August 4, 1972 and wholly unjustified because
the offer of reference to arbitration, negotiations failing, had been spurned by the Sabha. The notice
wound up with a command and a caveat:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 16Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

"If the workmen do not immediately resume duty, the Company would not be under
any obligation to continue in service those 32 workmen who have been taken back in
service pursuant to the settlement dated August 4, 1972. Besides, if (the workmen)
continue causing loss to the Company from time to time in this manner, the
Company will not also be bound to implement the Wage Board, recommendations on
and with effect from January 1, 1969, which may also be noted. The Company hereby
withdraws all its proposals unless the Workmen withdraw the strike and resume
work within two days."

This threat was dismissed by the workmen as a brutum fulmen and the strike continued. The
Management, therefore, came up on the notice board castigating the Sabha with irresponsible
obduracy in waging an illegal and unjustified strike. A warning of the shape of things to come was
given in this notice. The High Court has summed it up thus:

"The Company gave an intimation that in view of such obstinate attitude on the part
of the Sabha and the workmen, it had decided to withdraw its earlier offer to
implement the Wage Board recommendations on and with effect from January 1,
1969 as already cautioned in the notice dated January 27, 1973. The said decision
must be taken to have been thereby communicated to the workmen and Sabha. The
notice further stated that having regard to the obdurate, unreasonable and illegal
attitude adopted by the workmen and Sabha, the Company had decided to take
disciplinary proceedings against the defaulting workmen. In this connection, the
attention of the workmen was drawn to the fact that the strike was illegal not only
because of the terms of the settlement dated August 4, 1972 but also because of the
pendency of the reference relating to reinstatement of 32 workmen before the
Industrial Court and, that, therefore, the Company was entitled to take disciplinary
action against them. Finally, the Company appealed to the workmen to withdraw
their illegal and unjustified strike forthwith and to resume work."

These exercises notwithstanding, the strike raged undaunted, the production was paralysed and the
Management retaliated by an elaborate notice which dilated on its preparedness to negotiate or
arbitrate and the Sabha's unreason in rejecting the gesture and persisting on the war path. The stern
economic sanction was brought home in a critical paragraph:

"By this final notice the workmen are informed that they should withdraw the strike
and resume work before Thursday, February 15, 1973. If the workmen resume duty
accordingly, the management would be still willing to pay salary according to the
recommendations of the Wage Board on and with effect from January 1, 1969.
Furthermore, the management is ready and willing to refer to the arbitration of the
Industrial Tribunal the question as to whether the management has implemented the
settlement dated August 4, 1972 and all other labour problems. In spite of this, if the
workmen do not resume duty before Thursday, February 15, 1973. then the Company
will terminate the services of all workmen who are on strike and thereafter it will run
the factory by employing new workmen. All workmen may take note of this fact.”

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 17Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

The count-down thus began. February 15, 1973 arrived, and the Management struck the fatal blow of
discharging the strikers-all the labour force, 853 strong-and recruiting fresh hands and thus work
was resumed by February 19, 1973.

This public notice was allegedly sent to the Sabha and circulated to such workmen as hovered
around the factory. It is common case that the notice of February 15,1973, was not sent to individual
workmen but was a signal for action. The drastic consequence of disobedience was spelt out in no
uncertain terms:

"The workmen are hereby informed that they should resume duty on or before
Monday, February 19, 1973 failing which the Management will presume that the
workmen want to continue their strike and do not wish to resume work until their
demands as aforesaid are accepted by the management.

Parallel negotiations were going on even while mailed fist manoeuvres were being played up-thanks
to the basic goodwill and tradition of dispute settlements that existed in this company. Even amidst
the clash of arms, bilateral diplomacy has a place in successful industrial relations. The
Management and the Sabha allowed the talks to continue which, at any rate, clarified the area of
discord. One thing that stood out of these palavers was that both sides affirmed the pre-condition of
negotiations before arbitration over differences although the content, accent and connotation of
‘negotiations’ varied with each side. No tangible results flowed from these exercises and the
inevitable happened on February 21, 1973 when the Management blotted out the entire lot of 853
workmen from the roster, by separate orders of discharge from service, couched in identical terms.
The essential terms read thus :

"Your services are hereby terminated by giving you one month's salary in lieu of one
month's notice and accordingly you are discharged from service. You should collect
immediately from the cashier of the factory your one month's notice-pay and due pay,
leave entitlements and gratuity, if you are entitled to the same. The payment will be
made between 12 noon and 5 p.m. If and when you desire to be employed, you may
apply ill writing to the Company in that behalf and on receipt of the application, a
reply will be sent to you in the matter."

Casual workmen were issued separate but similar orders.

The Management did record its reasons for the action taken, on February 20, 1973 and forwarded
them to the Sabha and to the individual workmen on request. The anatomy of this proceeding is of
critical importance in deciding the character of the action. Was it a harm less farewell to the
workmen who were unwilling to rejoin or a condign punishment of delinquent workmen ?

The separate memorandum of Reasons refers to the strike as illegal and unjustified and narrates the
hostile history of assault by workmen of the officers, their go-slow tactics and sabotage activities,
their contumacious and a host of other perversities vindicating the drastic action of determining the
services of all the employees. The concluding portion reads partly stern and partly non- committal:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 18Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

"In the interest of the Company it is decided to terminate the services of all the
workmen who are on illegal and unjustified strike since 27th January, 1973.

Under the circumstances, it is decided that the services of all the workmen who are
on illegal and unjustified strike should be terminated by way of discharge simpliciter.
These workmen, however, may be given opportunity to apply for employment in the
Company and in case applications are received for employment from such employees,
such applications may be considered on their merits later on. It may be mentioned
here that while arriving at the aforesaid decision to terminate the services of the
workmen, various documents, notices, correspondence with the Union and others,
records of production, etc. have been considered and therefore the same are treated
as part of the relevant evidence to come to the conclusion as aforesaid.

FINAL CONCLUSION The services of all the workmen who are on illegal and
unjustified strike since 27-1-1973 should be terminated by way of discharge
simpliciter and they should be offered all their legal dues immediately. The
Administrative Manager is hereby directed to pass orders on individual workers as
per draft attached.

We thus reach the tragic crescendo when the Management and the workmen fell apart and all the
workmen's services were severed. Whether each of these orders using, in the contemporaneous
reasons, the vocabulary of misconduct but, in the formal part, the expression 'discharge simpliciter',
should be read softly as innocent termination or sternly as penal action, is one of the principal
disputes demanding decision.

We may as well complete the procession of events before taking up the major controversies decisive
of the case. The total termination of the entire work force of 853 employees was undoubtedly a
calamity of the first magnitude in a country of chronic unemployment and starving wages.
Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, discharge of employees may well be within the powers of
the Management subject to the provisions of the Act. With all the strikers struck off the rolls there
was for a time the silence of the grave. The conditional invitation to the employees to seek de novo
employment by fresh applications which would be considered on their merits, left the workers cold.
So the factory remained closed until April 28, 1973 when, with new workers recruited from the open
market, production recommenced. Among the militants, the morale which kept the strike going,
remained intact but among the others the pressure to report for employment became strong. Reemployment of discharged workmen began and slowly snowballed, so that by July 31, 1973 a
substantial number of 419 returned to the factory.

The crack of workman's morale was accelerated by escalating reemployment and the Management's
restoration of continuity of service and other benefits for re-employed hands. The Employer relied
on this gesture as proof of his bond fides. Meanwhile, there were exchanges of letters between and
‘trading’ of charges against each other. The Management alleged that the strikers were violent and
prevented loyalists' return while the Sabha was bitter that goondas were hired to break the strike
and promote blacklegs. These imputations have a familiar ring and their impact on the legality of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 19Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

the discharge of workmen falls for consideration a little later. The stream of events flowed on. The
Sabha protested that the Management was terrorising workmen, exploiting their sagging spirit and
illegally insisting on fresh applications for employment while they were in law continuing in
services. With more 'old workers' trickling back for work and their discharge orders being cancelled,
the strike became counter-productive. Many overtures on both sides were made through letters but
this epistolary futility failed to end the imbroglio and brought no bread. The worker wanted bread,
job, and no phyrric victory.

A crescent of hope appeared on the industrial sky. The Management but out a ‘final offer' on May 31,
1973, calling on all workmen to rejoin last the remaining vacancies also should be filled by fresh
recruits. The Sabha responded with readiness to settle and sought some clarifications and
assurances. The employer informed :

"Our offer is open till 10-6-1973. From 11-6-1973 we shall recruit new hands to the
extent necessary. Thereafter workers who will not have reported for work shall have
no chance left for re-employment with us. We repeat that those workers who will
report for work will be taken back in employment with continuity of their services,
that the orders of discharge passed against them on 21-2-1973 shall be treated as
cancelled and they will also be paid the difference in wages from 1969 as per the
recommendations of the Wage Board."

The Sabha was willing and wrote back on June 8, 1973 but sought details about the attitude of the
Management to the many pending demands. Meanwhile, the sands of time were running out and so
the Sabha telegraphed on 9th June that the workers were willing to report for work but were being
refused work. They demanded the presence of an impartial observer. The reply by the Management
repelled these charges, but there was some thaw in the estrangement, since the time for return to
work of the strikers was extended upto 16-6-73. An apparent end to a long strike was seemingly in
sight with the Sabha sore but driven to surrender. On 13- 6-73 the Sabha Secretary wrote back:

"This is a further opportunity to you even now to show your bona fides. If you
confirm to take all the workmen discharged on 21-2-1973 as stated in your various
letters and to give them intimation and reasonable time to join, | will see that your
offer is accepted by the workmen."

Here, at long last, was the Management willing to ‘welcome’ back all the former employees and the
Sabha limping back to the old wheels of work. Was the curtain being finally drawn on the feud ? Not
so soon, in a world of bad blood and bad faith; or may be, new developments make old offers
obsolete and the expected end proves an illusion. Anyway, the victor was the Management and II the
vanquished the Sabha and the re-employment offered was watered down. In our materialist cosmos,
often Might is Right and victory dictates morality ! Hot upon the receipt of the Sabha's letter
accepting the offer the Management back-tracked or had second thoughts on full re-employment.
For, they replied with a long catalogue of the Sabha's sins, set out the story of compulsion to keep
the production going and explained that since new hands had come on the scene full re-employment
was beyond them. In its new mood of victorious righteousness, the Management modified the terms

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 20Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

of intake of strikers and saddled choosy conditions on such absorption suggestive of breaking the
Sabha's solidarity:

"As on the present working of the Company, the Company, may still need about 250
more workers including those to be on the casual list as per the employment position
prior to the start of the strike. You may, therefore, send to us immediately per return
of post the list of the workers who can and are willing to join duty immediately so as
to enable us to select and employ the workmen as per the requirement of the
Company. Further, it would also be necessary for you to state in your reply that you
have called off the strike and have advised the workers to resume the work as
otherwise it is not clear from your letter as to whether you are still advocating the
continuance of the strike or that you have called off the strike. Therefore, unless we
have a very definite stand known from you on this issue, it may not be even now
possible for us to enter into any correspondence with you. We may again stress that if
your tactics of prolonging the issue by correspondence are continued the
management would be constrained to fake new recruits and in that case, at a later
date it may not be even possible to employ as many workmen as may be possible to
employ now."

Nothing is more galling, says Sri Tarkunde, than for a Union which has lost the battle and offered to
go back to work to be told that it should further humiliate itself by formally declaring the calling off
of the strike. Sentiment apart, the Sabha had agreed to go back, but then the Management cut down
the number to be re employed to 250 and, even this, on a selective basis. This selection could well be
to weed out Union activists or to drive a wedge among the Union members. These sensitive thoughts
and hard bargains kept the two apart. The Sabha, wounded but not wiped out, did not eat the
humble pie. The Management, on account of the intervening recruitments and injuries inflicted-by
the strike, did not budge either.

At this point we find that out of 853 employees who had been sacked 419 had wandered back by July
31, leaving 434 workmen at flotsam. Their reinstatement became the focus of an industrial dispute
raised by the Sabha. A few more were left out of this jobless mass, and through the intercession of
the Commissioner of Labour both sides agreed to resolve their disagreement by arbitral reference
under Sec. 10A of the Act, confining the dispute to reinstatement of 400 workmen discharged on
February 21 1973. A reference under Sec. 10A materialised. The 'Labour litigation’ began in May
1975 and becoming 'at each remove a lengthening chain' laboured from deck to deck and is coming
to a close, hopefully, by this decision. Is legal justice at such expensive length worth the candle or
counter-productive of social justice? Is a streamlined alternative beyond the creative genius of Law
India?

An aside As urgent as an industrial revolution is an industrial law revolution, if the rule of law were
at all to serve as social engineering. The current forensic process needs thorough overhaul because it
is over-judicialised and under- professionalised, lacking in social orientation and shop- floor
know-how and, by its sheer slow motion and high price, defects effective and equitable solution
leaving both Managements and Unions unhappy. If Parliament would heed, we stress this need.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 21Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

Industrial Justice desiderates specialised processual expertise and agencies.

This factual panorama, omitting a welter of debatable details and wealth of exciting embellishments,
being not germane to the essential issues, leads us to a formulation of the decisive questions which
alone need engage our discussion. The Management might have been right in its version or the
Sabha might have been wronged as it wails, but an objective assessment of the proven facts and
unbiased application of the declared law will yield the broad basis for working out a just and legal
solution. Here, it must be noticed that a new Union now exists even though its numerical following
is perhaps slender. We are not concerned whether it is the favoured child of the Management,
although it has received soft treatment in several settlements which have somewhat benefited the
whole work force and suggests a syndrome not unfamiliar among some industrial bosses allergic to
strong unions.

The central problem on the answer to which either the award of the arbitrator or the judgment of the
High Court can be sustained as sound is whether the discharge of the workmen en masse was all
innocuous termination or a disciplinary action. If the latter. the High Court's reasoning may broadly
be invulnerable. Secondly, what has been mooted before us is a question as to whether the evidence
before the Arbitrator, even if accepted at its face value, establishes any misconduct of any discharged
workman and further whether the misconduct, if any, made out is of such degree as to warrant
punitive discharge. Of course, the scope of Section 11A as including arbitrators, the power of
arbitrators, given sufficiently wide terms of reference, to examine the correctness and propriety of
the punishment, inter alia, deserve examination. Likewise the rules regarding reinstatement,
retrenchment, back wages and the like, fall for subsidiary consideration.

Prefatory to this discussion is the appreciation of the constitutional consciousness with regard to
Labour Law. The Constitution of India is not a non-aligned parchment but a partisan of social
justice with a direction and destination which it sets in the Preamble and Art. 38, and so, when we
read the evidence, the rulings, the statute and the rival pleas we must be guided by the value set of
the Constitution. We not only appraise Industrial Law from this perspective in the disputes before
us but also realise that ours is a mixed economy with capitalist mores, only slowly wobbling towards
a socialist order, notwithstanding Sri Garg's thoughts. And, after all ideals apart. ‘law can never be
higher than the economic order and the cultural development of society brought to pass by that
economic order’. The new jurisprudence in industrial relations must prudently be tuned to the
wave-length of our constitutional values whose emphatic expression is found in a passage quoted by
Chief Justice Rajamannar of the Madras High Court. The learned judge observed :

"The doctrine of ‘laissez faire' which held sway in the world since the time of Adam
Smith has practically given place to a doctrine which emphasises the duty of the state
to interfere in the affairs of individuals in the interests of the social well-being of the
entire community. As Julian Huxley remarks in his essay on "Economic Man and
Social Man": "Many of our old ideas must be retranslated, so to speak, into a new
language. The democratic idea of freedom, for instance, must lose its nineteenth
century meaning of individual liberty in the economic sphere, and become adjusted
to new conception of social duties and responsibilities.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 22Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

When a big employer talks about his democratic rights to individual freedom,
meaning thereby a claim to socially irresponsible control over a huge industrial
concern and over the lives of tens of thousands of human beings whom it happens to
employ, he is talking in a dying language."

Homo economicus can no longer warp the social order.

Even so the Constitution is ambitiously called socialist but realists will agree that a socialist
transformation of the law of labour relations is a slow though steady judicial desideratum. Until
specific legislative mandates emerge from Parliament the court may mould the old but not make the
new law. 'Interstitially, from the molar to the molecular' is the limited legislative role of the court, as
Justice Holmes said and Mr. Justice Mathew quoted (see [1976] 2 S.C.C. at p. 343).

The Core Question Right at the forefront falls the issue whether the orders of discharge are, as
contended by Sri Tarkunde, de facto dismissals, punitive in impact and, therefore, liable to be
voided if the procedural imperatives for such disciplinary action are not complied with, even though
draped in silken phrases like 'termination simpliciter'. It is common case that none of the processes
implicit in natural justice and mandated by the relevant standing orders have been complied with,
were we to construe the orders impugned as punishment by way of discharge or dismissal. But Sri
Ashok Sen impressively insists that the orders here are simple terminations with no punitive
component, as, on their face, the orders read. To interpret otherwise is to deny to the employer the
right, not to dismiss but to discharge, when the law gives him option.

An analysis of the standing orders in the background of disciplinary jurisprudence is necessitous at
this point of the case.

The Model Standing orders prescribed under Section 15 of the Industrial Employment (Standing
Orders) Act, 1946, apply to this factory. Order 23, clauses (1) and (4), relate to termination of
employment of permanent workmen. Termination of their services on giving the prescribed notice
or wages in lieu of such notice is provided for. But clause (4A) requires reasons for such termination
of service of permanent workmen to be recorded and, if asked for, communicated. This is obviously
intended to discover the real reason for the discharge so that remedies available may not be defeated
by clever phraseology of orders of termination. Clause (7) permits the services or non- permanent
workmen to be terminated without notice except when such temporary workmen are discharged by
way of punishment. Punitive discharge is prohibited unless opportunity to show-cause against
charges of misconduct is afforded (Standing order 15). Orders of termination of service have to be by
the Manager and in writing and copies of orders shall be furnished to the workmen concerned.
Standing order 24 itemizes the acts and omissions which amount to misconduct "According to
clause (b) of the said Standing order, going on an illegal strike or abetting, inciting instigating or
acting in furtherance thereof amounts to misconduct. Standing order 25 provides for penalty
impossible on a workman guilty of misconduct. Accordingly amongst other punishments, a
workman could be visited with the penalty of discharge under order 23 of dismissal without notice
for a misconduct [see sub- clauses (f) and (g) of clause (1 ) j. Clause (3) provides that no order of
dismissal under sub clause

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 23Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

(g) of clause (1) shall be made except after holding an enquiry against the workman concerned in
respect of the alleged misconduct in the manner set forth in clause (4). Clause (4) provides for giving
to the concerned workman a charge-sheet and an opportunity to answer the charge and the right to
be defended by a workman working in the same department as himself and production of witnesses
and cross-examination of witnesses on whom the charge rests. Under clause (6), in awarding
punishment the Manager has to take into account the gravity of the misconduct, the previous
record, if any, of the workman, and any other extenuating or aggravating circumstances." The
finding of the Arbitrator that the workmen went on a strike which was illegal and in which they had
participated is not disputed. In this background, the application of the procedural imperatives
before termination of services of the workmen, in the circumstances of the present case, has to be
judged. This, in turn, depends on the key finding as to whether the discharge orders issued by the
management were punitive or non-penal.

The anatomy of a dismissal order is not a mystery, once we agree that substance, not semblance,
governs the decision. Legal criteria are not so slippery that verbal manipulations may outwit the
court. Broadly stated, the face is the index to the mind and an order fair on its face may be taken at
its face value. But there is more to it than that, because sometimes words are designed to conceal
deeds by linguistic engineering. So it is beyond dispute that the form of the order or the language in
which it is couched is not conclusive. The court will lift the veil to see the true nature of the order.

Many situations arise where courts have been puzzled because the manifest language of the
termination order is equivocal or misleading and dismissals have been dressed up as simple
termination. And so, judges have dyed into distinctions between the motive and the foundation of
the order and a variety of other variations to discover the. true effect of an order of termination.
Rulings are a maze on this question but, in sum, the conclusion is clear. If two factors coexist, an
inference of punishment is reasonable though not inevitable. What arc they ?

If the severance of service is effected, the first condition is fulfilled and if the foundation or causa
causans of such severance is the servant's misconduct the second is fulfilled. If the basis or
foundation for the order of termination is clearly not turpitudinous or stigmatic or rooted in
misconduct or visited with evil pecuniary effects, then the inference of dismissal stands negated and
vice versa. These canons run right through the disciplinary branch of master and servant
jurisprudence, both under Article 311 and in other cases including workmen under managements
The law cannot be stultified by verbal haberdashery because the court will lift the mask and discover
the true face. It is true that decisions of this Court and of the, High Courts since Dhingra's case (1958
SCR

828) have been at times obscure. if cited de hors the full facts. In Samsher Singh's case the
unsatisfactory state of the law was commented upon by one of us, per Krishna Iyer, J., quoting Dr.
Tripathi for support:

"In some cases, the rule of guidance has been stated to be 'the substance of the
matter’ and the 'foundation' of the order. When does 'motive' trespass into

‘foundation’ ? When do we lift the veil of form to touch the 'substance' ? When the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 24Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

Court says so. These 'Freudian' frontiers obviously fail in the work-a-day world and
Dr. Tripathi's observations in this context are not without force. He says:

‘As already explained, in a situation where the order of termination purports to be a
mere order of discharge without.

stating the stigmatizing results of the departmental enquiry a Search for the
‘substance of the matter’ will be indistinguishable from a search for the motive (real,
unrevealed object) of the order. Failure to appreciate this relationship between
motive (the real, but unrevealed object) and from (the apparent, or officially revealed
object) in the present con text has lead to an unreal inter-play of words and phrases
wherein symbols like 'motive’, 'substance' 'form' or ‘direct’ parade in different
combinations without communicating precise situations or entities in the world of
facts.' The need, in this branch of jurisprudence, is not so much to reach perfect
justice but to lay down a plain test which the administrator and civil servant can
understand without subtlety and apply without difficulty. After all, between
‘unsuitability’ and 'misconduct' thin partitions do their bounds divide’. And over the
years, in the rulings of this Court the accent has shifted, the canons have varied and
predictability has proved difficult because the play of legal light and shade has been
baffling. The learned Chief Justice has in his judgement, tackled this problem and
explained the rule which must govern the determination of the question as to when
termination of service of a probationer can be said to amount to discharge simpliciter
and when it can be said to amount to punishment so as to attract the inhibition of Art

311.

Masters and servants cannot be permitted to play hide and seek with. the law of dismissals and the
plain and proper criteria are not to be misdirected by terminological cover-ups or by appeal to
psychic processes but must be grounded on the substantive reason for the order, whether disclosed
or undisclosed. The Court will find out from other proceedings or documents connected with the
formal order of termination what the true ground for the termination is. If, thus scrutinized, the
order has a punitive flavour in cause or consequence, it is dismissal. If it falls short of this test, it
cannot be called a G punishment. To put it slightly differently, a termination effected because the
master is satisfied of the misconduct and of the consequent desirability of terminating the service of
the delinquent servant, it is a dismissal, even if he had the right in law to terminate with an innocent
order under the standing order or otherwise. Whether, in such a case the grounds are recorded in a
different proceeding from the formal order does not detract from its nature. Nor the fact that, after
being satisfied of the guilt, the master abandons the enquiry and proceeds to terminate. Given an
alleged misconduct and a live nexus between it and the termination of service the conclusion is
dismissal. even if full benefits as on simple termination, are given and non-injurious terminology is
used.

On the contrary, even if there is suspicion of misconduct the master may say that he does not wish to
bother about it and may not go into his guilt but may feel like not keeping a man he is not happy

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 25Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

with. He may not like to investigate nor take the risk of continuing a dubious servant. Then it is not
dismissal but termination simpliciter, if no injurious record of reasons or punitive pecuniary
cut-back on his full terminal benefits is found. For, in fact, misconduct is not then the moving factor
in the discharge. We need not chase other hypothetical situations here.

What is decisive is the plain reason for the discharge. not the strategy of a non-enquiry or clever
avoidance of stigmatizing epithets. If the basis is not misconduct, the order is saved. In Murugan
Mills, this Court observed:

"The right of the employer to terminate the services of his workman under a standing
order, like cl. 17(a) in the present case, which accounts to a claim "to hire and fire’ an
employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service
which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication.
came up for consideration before the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Buckingham and
Carnatic Co. Ltd. v. Workers of the Company. The matter then came up before this
before this Court also in Chartered Bank v. Chartered Bank Employees Union(3) and
the Management of U.B. Dutt & Co. v. Workmen of U. B. Dutt & Co.(4) Wherein the
view taken by Labour Appellate Tribunal was approved and it was held that even in a
case like the present the requirements of bona fides was essential and if the
termination of service was a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of
victimization or unfair labour practice the industrial tribunal would have the
jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination. The form of the order in
such a case is not conclusive and the Tribunal can go behind the order to find the
reasons which led to the order and then consider for itself whether the termination
was a colourable exercise of the power or was a result of victimisation or unfair
labour practice. If it came to the conclusion that the termination was a colourable
exercise of the power or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice. it
would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination."

Again, in Chartered Bank v. Employees Union his Court emphasised:

" .... The form of the order of termination is not conclusive of the true nature of the
order, for it is possible that the form may be merely a camouflage for an order of
misconduct. It is, therefore, always open to the Tribunal to go behind the form and
look at the substance and if it comes to the conclusion, for example, that though in
form the order amounts to termination simpliciter, it in reality cloaks a dismissal for
misconduct, it will be open to it to set it aside as a colourable exercise of the Power."

A rain of rulings merely adds to the volume, not to the weight of the proposition, and so we desist
from citing all of them. A bench of seven judges of this Court considered this precise point in

Shamsher Singh's case and Chief Justice Ray ruled:

"The form of the order is not decisive as to whether the order is by way of
punishment. Even an innocuously worded order terminating the service may in the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 26Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

facts and circumstances of the case establish that an enquiry into allegations of
serious and grave character of misconduct involving stigma has been made in
infraction of the provision of Article 311. In such a case the simplicity of the form of
the order will not give any sanctity. That is exactly what has happened in the case of
Ishwar Chand Agarwal. The order of termination IS illegal and must he set aside."

Simple termination or Punitive Discharge ?

We must scan the present order of discharge of 853 workmen and ask the right questions to decide
whether they are punishments or innocent terminations. Neither judicial naivete nor managerial
ingenuity will put the court off the track of truth. What. then, are the diagnostic factors in the orders

An isolated reading of the formal notices terminating their services reveals no stigma, no penalty, no
misconduct. They have just been told off. But the Management admits that as required by the
Standing orders it has recorded reasons for the discharge. There, several pages of damnatory
conduct have been heaped on the workers collectively accounting for the resort of the Management
to the extreme step of discharging the whole lot, there being no alternative. Sri A. K. Sen took us
through the various appeals made by the Management, the losses sustained. the many offers to
negotiate and arbitrate, the Sabha's deaf obduracy and resort to sudden strike and violent tactics
and, worst of all, its attempts to persuade the Central Government to take over the factory as a ‘sick’
mill. These ordeals were, described by Sri Ashok Sen graphically to justify the submission that the
Management had no choice, caught between Scylla of strike and Charybdis of take-over, but to get
rid of the strikers and recruit new workers. If the employer did not discharge the strikers they were
adamant and would not return to world, and the very closure compelled by the Sabha was being
abused by it to tell the Central Government that for three months there had been no production and
so the mill qualified to be taken over as ‘sick’ under the Industries (Development and Regulation)
Act. If the Management discharged the workers to facilitate fresh recruitment and save the factory
from statutory takeover the cry was raised that the action was dismissal because an elaborate
enquiry was not held. The Management had avoided injury to the workmen, argued Sri Sen, by
merely terminating their services without resort to disciplinary action and recording the
uncomplimentary grounds in a separate invisible order. He also underscored the fact that the strike
was illegal and unjustified as concurrently held by the Arbitrator and the High Court.

We agree that industrial law promotes industrial life, not industrial death, Any realism is the soul of
legal dynamics. Any doctrine that destroys industrial progress interlaced with social justice is lethal
juristic and cannot be accepted. Each side has its own version of the role of the other which we must
consider before holding either guilty. Sri Tarkunde told us the tale of woe of the workmen. In 3
country where the despair of Government is appalling unemployment it is a terrible tragedy to put
to economic death 853 workmen. And for what? For insisting that the pittance of Rs. 100 per month
be raised in terms of the Central Wage Board recommendations, as long ago agreed to by the
Management but put off by the tantalizing but treacherous offer of arbitration. When the point
admitted of easy negotiated solution. Arbitration looks nice, but. since 1969, the hungry families
have been yearning for a morsel more, he urged. Blood, toil, sweat and tears for the workers and all

the profits' and production for the Management, was the industrial irony! Knowing that every
arbitral or other adjudicatory agency in India, especially when weak Labour is pitted against strong
Capital in the sophisticated processual system, consumes considerable time, the lowly working class
is allergic to this dilatory offer of arbitration. They just don't survive to eat the fruits. Such was his
case.

The story of violence was also refuted by Sri Tarkunde, since the boot was on the other leg. Goondas
were hired by the Management to sabotage the fundamental right to strike and with broken hearts
several of them surrendered. When, at last, the Sabha agreed to see that all workmen reported for
work within the extended time, the Management took to the typical tactics of victimisation of
refusing work for all, as first offered, and of picking and choosing even for the 250 vacancies.
Moreover, other conditions were put upon the Sabha calculated to break unionism which those
familiar with trade union movements would painfully appreciate. This insult and injury apart, the
orders of termination were painly dismissals for a series of alleged misconducts which were
chronicled in separate proceedings. The formal order was like a decree, the grounds recorded
contemporaneously were like the judgment, to use court vocabulary. It was obvious that the
foundation for the termination was the catena of charges set out by the Management. The true
character of the order could not be hidden by the unfair device of keeping a separate record and
omitting it from the normal communication. Law is not such an ass as yet and if the intent and effect
is damnatory the action is disciplinary.

Between these two competing cases, presented by counsel, we have to gravitate towards the correct
factual- legal conclusion. A number of peripheral controversies have been omitted from this
statement, for brevity's sake. When two high tribunals have spread out the pros and cons it is
supererogation for this Court to essay likewise, and miniaturization is a wise husbandry of judicial
resources. First, we must decide whether the order of termination was a punitive discharge or a
simple discharge.

Here we reach the dilemma of the law for discovering unfailing guidelines to distinguish between
discharge simpliciter and dismissal sinister. The search for infallible formulae is vain and only
pragmatic humanism can help navigate towards just solutions. We have earlier explained that from
Dhingra's case to Shamsher Singh's case, the law has been dithering but some rough and ready rules
can be decocted to serve in most situations. Law, in this area, is a pragmatist, not a philologist, and
we have set out the dual diagnostic tests applicable in such cases.

It was not retrenchment, according to the Management. Then what was it ? If there was work to be
done, why terminate services of workmen except as punishment ? Because, argued Sri Sen, the
workers did not work, being on strike and the Management, bent on keeping the factory going,
needed workmen who work. To recruit fresh hands into the lists and to keep the old hands on the
roster was double burden, and, therefore, the strikers had to be eased out to yield place to new
recruits. The object was not to punish the workmen but to keep the factory working Accepting this
plea, as it were, the award of the arbitrator has exonerated the Management of the charge of
dismissal while the High Court has held the action to be dismissal for misconduct and therefore bad
in law.

In our opinion, the facts of the case before us speak for themselves Here are workmen on strike. The
strike is illegal. The Management is hurt because production is paralyzed. The strikers allegedly
indulge ill objectionable. activities. The exasperated Management hits back by ordering their
discharge for reasons set out in several pages in the appropriate contemporaneous proceeding.
Misconduct after misconduct is flung on the workers to justify the drastic action In all conscience
and common sense, the discharge is the punishment for the misconduct. The Management minces
no words. What is explicity stated is not a colourless farewell to make way for fresh hands to work
the factory until the strike is settled but a hard hitting order with grounds of guilt and penalty of
removal.

The inference is inevitable, however, ingenious the contrary argument, that precisely because the
Management found the workmen refractory in their misconduct they were sacked. Maybe, the
management had no other way of working the factory but that did not change the character of the
action taken. Once we hold the discharge punitive the necessary consequence is that enquiry before
punishment was admittedly obligatory and confessedly not undertaken. The orders were bad on this
score alone.

Sri A. K. Sen urged that in a dismissal the employee is denied some of the retiral and other benefits
which he gets in a simple discharge, and here all the employees were offered their full monetary
benefits, so that it was wrong to classify the orders of discharge as punitive. Maybe, a dismissed
servant may well be disentitled to some, at least, of the financial benefits which his counterpart
who-is simply discharged may draw. But that is not a conclusive test. Otherwise, the master may
‘cashier’ his servant and camouflage it by offering full retiral benefits. Dismissal is not discharge plus
a price. The substance of the action is the litmus test. In the present case, the penal core, 'tied ,4. in
tooth and claw, shows up once we probe; and the non-committal frame of the formal order is a
disguise. For a poor workman loss of his job is a heavy penalty when inflicted for alleged
misconduct, for he is so hungry that, in Gandhiji's expressive words, he sees God Himself in a loaf of
bread.

Before we leave this part of the case, a reference to some industrial law aspects and cases may be
apposite though a little repetitive Standing orders certified for an industrial undertaking or the
model Standing orders framed under the Industrial Employment Standing orders Act provide for
discharge simpliciter, a term understood in contradistinction to punitive discharge or discharge by
way of penalty. It is not unknown that an employer resorts to camouflage by garbing or cloaking, a
punitive discharge in the innocuous words of discharge simpliciter. Courts have to interpose in
order to ascertain whether the discharge is one simpliciter or a punitive discharge, and in doing so
the veil of language is lifted and the realities perceived. In the initial stages the controversy raised
was whether the court/tribunal had any jurisdiction to lift such a veil. Prove and penetrate so as to
reveal the reality, but this controversy has been set at rest by the decision in Western India
Automobile Association v. Industrial Tribunal Bombay. The wide scope of the jurisdiction of
industrial tribunal,’ court in this behalf is now well established. If standing orders or the terms of
contract permit the employer to terminate the services of his employee by discharge simpliciter
without assigning reasons, it would be open to him to take recourse to the said term or condition
and terminate the services of his employee but when the validity of such termination is challenged in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 29Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

industrial adjudication it would be competent to the industrial Tribunal to ensure whether the
impugned discharge has been effected in the bona fide exercise of the power conferred by the terms
of employment. If the discharge has been ordered by the employer in bona fide exercise of his
power, then the industrial tribunal may not interfere with it; but the words used in the order of
discharge and the form which it may have taken are not conclusive in the matter an(I the industrial
tribunal would be entitled to go behind the words and form and decide whether the discharge is a
discharge simpliciter or not If it appears that the purported exercise of power to terminate the
Services of the employee was in fact the result of the misconduct alleged against him. then the
tribunal would be justified in dealing with the dispute on the basis; that, despite its appearance to
the contrary. the order of discharge is in effect an order of dismissal. In the exercise of this power,
the court/tribunal would be entitled to interfere with the order in question [see Assam Co. v. Its
Workmen]. In the matter of an order of discharge of an employee as understood within the meaning
of the Industrial Disputes Act the iron of the order and the language in which it is couched are not
decisive. If the industrial court is satisfied that the order of discharge is punitive or that it amount;
to victimisation or unfair labour practice it is competent to the Court/tribunal to set aside the order
in a proper case and direct reinstatement of the employee [see Tata oil Mills Co. Ltd. v. Workmen].
The form used for terminating the service is not conclusive and the tribunal has jurisdiction to
enquire into the reasons which led to such termination In the facts of the case it was found that
Standing orders provided that an employee could ask for reasons for discharge in the case of
discharge simpliciter. Those reasons were given before the tribunal by the appellant, viz., that the
respondents services were terminated because he deliberately resorted to go-slow and was negligent
in the discharge of his duty. It was accordingly held that the services of the employee were
terminated for dereliction of duty and go-slow in his work which clearly amounted to punishment
for misconduct and. therefore. to pass an order under cl. 17(a) of the Standing orders permitting
discharge simpliciter in such circumstances was clearly a colorable exercise of power to terminate
services of a workman under the provision of the Standing orders. In these circumstances the
tribunal would be justified in going behind the order and deciding for itself whether the termination
of the respondent's services could be sustained (vide Management of Murugan Mills Ltd. v.
Industrial Tribunal, Madras & Anr. This view was affirmed in Tata Engineering & Locomotive Co.
Ltd. v. S. C. Prasad & Anr.(4). After approving the ratio in Murugan Mills case, this Court in L.
Michael & Anr. v. M/s. Johnson Pumps India Ltd observed that the manner of dressing up an order
did not matter. The slightly different observation in Workmen of Sudder office, Cinnamare v.
Management was explained by the Court and it was further affirmed that since the decision of this
Court in the Chartered Bank v. The Chartered Bank Employee's Union it has taken the consistent
view that if the termination of service is a colourable exercise of power vested in the management or
is a result of victimization or unfair labour practice, the court/tribunal would have jurisdiction to
intervene and set aside such termination. It was urged that a different view was taken by this Court
in Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. P. S. Malvenkar & ors. The employee in that was
discharged from service by paying one month's wages in lieu of notice This action was challenged by
the employee before the Labour Court and it was contended that it was a punitive discharged. The
Corporation contended that wider Standing order No. 26 the Corporation had the power to
discharge but there was an obligation to give reasons if so demanded by the employee. The
Corporation had also the power to discharge by way of punishment. The Court in this connection
observed as under:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 30Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

"Now one thing must be borne in mind that these are two distinct and independent
powers and as far as possible either should be construed so as to emasculate the other
cr to render it ineffective. One is the power to punish an employee for misconduct
while the other is the power to terminate simpliciter the service of an employee
without any, other adverse consequence. Now. proviso (i) to clause (1) of Standing
order 26 requires that the reason for termination of the employment should be given
in writing to the employee when exercising the power of termination of service of the
employee under Standing order 26. Therefore, when the service of an employee is
terminated simpliciter under Standing order 26, the reason for such termination has
to be given to the employee and this provision has been made in the Standing order
with a view to ensuring that the management does not act in an arbitrary manner.
The management is required to articulate the reason which operated on its mind in
terminating the service cf the employee. But merely because the reason for
terminating the service of the employee is required to be given and the reason must
obviously not be arbitrary, capricious or irrelevant-it would not necessarily in every
case make the order or termination punitive in character so as require compliance
with the requirement of clause (2) of Standing order 21 read with Standing order 23.
Otherwise. the power of termination of service of an employee under Standing order
26 would be rendered meaningless and futile for in no case it would be possible to
exercise it. Of course, if misconduct of the employee constitutes the foundation for
terminating his service, then even if the order of termination is purported to be made
under Standing order 26, it may be liable to be regarded as punitive in character
attracting the procedure of clause (2) of Standing order 21 read with Standing order
23, though even in such a case it may be argued that the management n has not
punished the employee but has merely terminated his service under Standing order

26."

It does not purport to run counter to the established ratio that the form of the order is not decisive
and the Court can lift the veil. How ever, it may be noted that there was an alternative contention
before the Court that even if the order of discharge was considered punitive in character, the
employer corporation had led evidence before the labour court to substantiate the charge of
misconduct and that finding was also affirmed.

We are satisfied that the Management, whatever its motives vis-a-vis keeping the stream of
production flowing, did remove from service, on punitive grounds, all the 853 workmen.

The law is trite that the Management may still ask for an opportunity to make out a case for
dismissal before the Tribunal. The refinements of industrial law in this branch need not detain u.s
because the arbitrator did investigate and hold that the workmen were guilty of misconduct and the
‘sentence’ of dismissal was merited, even as the High Court did reappraise and reach, on both
counts, the reverse conclusion.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 31Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

The sweep of Article 226 Once we assume that the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to enquire into the
alleged misconduct was exercised, was there any ground under Article 226 of the Constitution to
demolish that holding ? Every wrong order cannot be righted merely because it is wrong. It can be
quashed only if it is vitiated by the fundamental flaws of gross miscarriage of justice, absence of legal
evidence, perverse misreading of facts, serious errors of law on the face of the order, jurisdictional
failure and the like.

While the remedy under Article 226 is extraordinary and is of Anglo-Saxon vintage, it is not a
carbon copy of English processes. Article 226 is a sparing surgery but the lancet operates where
injustice suppurates. While traditional restraints like availability of alternative remedy hold back the
court, and judicial power should not ordinarily rush in where the other two branches fear to tread,
judicial daring is not daunted where glaring injustice demands even affirmative action.

The wide words of Article 226 are designed for service of the lowly numbers in their grievances if the
subject belongs to the court's province and the remedy is appropriate to the judicial process. There
is native hue about Article 226, without being anglophile or anglophobic in attitude. Viewed from
this jurisprudential perspective, we have to be cautious both in not overstepping as if Article. 226
were as large as an appeal and not failing to intervene where a grave error has crept in. Moreover,
we sit here in appeal over the High Court s Judgement. And an appellate power interferes not when
the order appealed is not right but only when it is clearly wrong. The difference is real, though fine.

What are the primary facts which have entered the Tribunal's verdict in holding the strikers guilty of
misconduct meriting dismissal ? We must pause to remove a confusion and emphasise that the
dismissal, order is not against the Union but the individual workers. What did each one do ? Did his
conduct, when sifted and scrutinised, have any exculpation or extenuation ? Not strikers in the
mass, but each worker separately, must be regarded as the unit of disciplinary action. Each one's
role and the degree of turpitude, his defence on guilt and punishment, must be adjudged before
economic death sentence is inflicted. A typical trial process instance will illumine the point. Suppose
there is case of arson and murder in a village because of communal faction and a hundred men from
the aggressive community are charged in court with serious offences. Suppose further that
convincing testimony of the provocation and aggression by that community is produced. Can any
single member of the violent community be convicted on 'mass' evidence, without specific charges of
participation or clear proof of constructive involvement ? Judicial perspicacity clears this common
fallacy. It is dangerous to mass-convict on the theory of community built. Anger sometimes brings in
this error.

In our assessment, the arbitrator has been swayed by generalities where particularities alone would
have sufficed. A long story may be made short by skipping the details and focussing on essentials.
We must, in fairness, state that the Arbitrator, an experienced and accepted tribunal in labour
disputes, has exhaustively brought into the Award all available details pro and con with overemphasis here and there. There are only a few confusions in his long award but, regrettably, they
happen to be on a few fundamentals. The foremost, of course, is a mix-up between mob-misconduct
and individual guilt. The next is getting lost in the oceanic evidence while navigating towards a 1
specified port. The High Court too has excelled in marshalling the details and handling the legal

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 32Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

issues, although, even there, shortcomings on basic issues have been pointed out by Sri A. K. Sen.
We too are apt to err and reverse ourselves although we try our best to avoid error. The Supreme
Court is final not because it is infallible; it is infallible; because it is final. propose to examine the
essential issues from the perspective We have set out and in their proper jurisprudential bearings.

If misconduct was basic to the discharge and no enquiry precedent to the dismissal was made the
story did not end there in favour of the workmen. The law is well-settled that the Management may
still satisfy the tribunal about the misconduct.

As a fact the arbitrator held misconduct proved. He further found that the circumstances justified
dismissal though he decided the order to mean discharge simpliciter Was misconduct proved
against each discharged worker at least before the arbitrator ? If it was, did every worker deserve
punitive discharge ?

Dual jurisdictional issues arise here which have been argued at some length before us. The position
taken up by Sri Sen was that the High Court could not, under Article 226, direct reinstatement, and
even it felt that the arbitrator had gone wrong in refusing reinstatement, the court could only
demolish the order and direct the arbitrator to reconsider the issue. What belonged, as a
discretionary power, to a tribunal or other adjudicatory body could not be wrested by the writ court.
To put it pithily, regarding the relief of reinstatement, the arbitrator could but would not and the
High Court would but could not. (We will deal later with the point that the arbitrator had himself no
power under Section 11 A of the Act but did have it in view of the wide terms of reference.) The basis
of this submission as we conceive it. is the traditional limitations woven around high prerogative
writs. Without examining the correctness of this limitation, we disregard it because while Article
226 has been inspired by the royal writs its sweep and scope exceed hide-bound British processes of
yore. We are what we are because our Constitution-framers have felt the need for a pervasive reserve
power in the higher judiciary to right wrongs under our conditions. Heritage cannot hamstring; nor
custom constrict where the language used is wisely wide. The British paradigms are not necessarily
models in the Indian Republic. So broad are the expressive expressions designedly used in Article
226 that any order which should have been made by the lower authority could be made by the High
Court. The very width of the power and the disinclination to meddle, except where gross injustice or
fatal illegality and the like are present inhibit the exercise but do not abolish the power.

We may dilate a little more on Article 226 vis-a-vis awards of arbitrators. The first limb of the
argument is that when there is a voluntary joint submission of an industrial dispute to an Arbitrator
named by them under s. 10A of the Industrial Disputes Act, he does not function as a Tribunal and is
not amenable to the jurisdiction of that Court under Article 227 or under Article 226. Without
further elaboration this contention can be negatived on a decision of this Court in Rohtas Industries
Ltd. & Anr. v. Rohtas Industries State Union ors. (1) This Court observed that as the Arbitrator
under s. 10A has the power to bind even those who are not parties to the reference or agreement and
the whole exercise under s. 10A as well as the source of the force of the Award on publication
derived from the statute, it is legitimate to regard such an arbitrator now as part of the
infrastructure of the sovereigns dispensation of justice, thus falling within the rainbow of statutory
tribunals amenable to judicial review.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 33Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

The second limb of the argument was that a writ of certiorari could not be issued to correct errors of
facts. In this connection after affirming the ratio in Engineering Mazdoor Sabha v. Hind Cycle Ltd.,
this Court observes that what is important is a question of law arising on the face of the facts found
and its resolution ex facie or sub silentio. The Arbitrator may not state the law as such; even then
such acute silence confers no greater or subtler immunity on the award than plain speech. We do
not dilate on this part of the argument as we are satisfied that be the test the deeply embedded rules
to issue certiorari or the traditional grounds to set aside an arbitration award 'thin partition do their
bounds divide' on the facts and circumstances of the present case. Broadly stated, the principle of
law is that the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is limited to
holding the judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals or administrative bodies exercising the quasi-judicial
powers within the leading strings of legality and to see that they do not exceed their statutory
jurisdiction and correctly administer the law laid down by the statute under which they act. So long
as the hierarchy of officers and appellate authorities created by the statute function within their
ambit the manner in which they do so can he no ground for interference. The power of judicial
supervision of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution (as it then stood) is not greater
than those under Article 226 and it must be limited to seeing that a tribunal functions within the
limits of its authority [see Nagendra Nath Bora & Anr. v. The Commissioner of Hills Division &
Appeals, Assam & ors.(a) ]. This led to a proposition that in exercising jurisdiction under Article 226
the High Court is not constituted a Court of appeal over the decision of authorities, administrative
or quasi-judicial. Adequacy or sufficiency of evidence is not its meat. It is not the function of a High
Court in a petition for a writ under Art 226 to review the evidence and to arrive at an independent
finding on the evidence. [See State of Andhra Pradesh v. S. Shree Rama Rao ] A constitution Bench
of this Court in P. H. Kalyani v. M/s-. Air France, Calcutta ) succinctly set out the limits of the
jurisdiction of the High Court in dealing with a writ petition. It was said that in order to justify a writ
of certiorari it must be shown that an order suffers from an error apparent on the face of the record.
It was further pointed out that in the finding of fact is made by the impugned order and it is shown
that it success from an error of law and not of fact, a writ under Article 226 would issue, and, while
so saying, the decision in Nagendra Nath Bora's case was affirmed. Following the aforementioned
decision, the Gujarat High Court in Navinchandra Shakerchand Shah v. Manager, Ahmedabad
Coop. Department Stores Ltd. observed that the amended Article 226 would enable the High Court
to interfere with an Award of the industrial adjudicator if that is based on a complete misconception
of law or it is based on no evidence or that no reasonable man would come to the conclusion to
which the Arbitrator has arrived.

Even apart from, but while approving, the Gujarat ruling in 19 G.L.R. p. 108 cited before us, we are
satisfied that the writ power is larger given illegality and injustice, even if its use is severely
discretionary as decided cases have repeatedly laid down. We over-rule the objection of invalidity of
the High Courts order for want of power.

The more serious question is whether the arbitrator had the plenitude of power to re-examine the
punishment imposed by the Management, even if he disagreed with its severity. In this ease the
arbitrator expressed himself as concurring with the punishment. But if he had disagreed, as the
High Court, in his place, did, could he have interfered? Armed with the language of Sec. 11A, which
confers wide original power to the tribunal to re-fix the 'sentence’, Sri Sen argued that an arbitrator

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 34Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

was uncovered by this new Section. So, even if he would, he could not. And, in this case if he could,
he would not. There the matter ended, was the argument. We disagree. Even if he could. he would
not, true; but that did not preclude the High Court from reviewing the order in exercise of its
extraordinary constitutional power. Moreover, Sec. 11A did clothe the arbitrator with similar power
as tribunals, despite the doubt created by the abstruse absence A of specific mention of ‘arbitrator’ in
Sec. 11A. This position needs closer examination and turns on interpretational limitations. At this
stage, to facilitate the discussion, we may read the provision:

"11A. Where an industrial dispute relating to the discharge or dismissal of a workmen
has been referred to a 1 Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal for adjudication
and, in the course of the adjudication proceedings, the Labour Court, Tribunal or
National Tribunal, as the case may be, is satisfied that the order of discharge or
dismissal was not justified, it may, as it thinks fit, or give such other relief to the
Workman on such terms and conditions, if any, as it thinks fit, or give such other
relief to the workman, including the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of
discharge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case may require:

Provided that in any proceeding under this section the Labour Court Tribunal or
National Tribunal as the case may be, shall rely on the materials on record and shall
not take any fresh evidence in relation to the matter".

Sec. 11A was introduced in purported implementation cf the I.L.O. recommendation which expressly
referred, inter alia to arbitrators. The Statement of objects and Reasons which illumines the words
of the legislative text when it is half-lit, even if it cannot directly supplement the section, does speak
of the I.L.o. recommendations and, in terms of tribunals and arbitrators. When it came to drafting
Section 11A the. word ‘arbitrator' was missing. Was this of deliberate legislative design to deprive
arbitrators, who discharge identical functions as tribunals under the Industrial Disputes Act, of
some vital powers which vested in their tribunal brethren ? For what mystic purpose could such
distinction be ? Functionally, tribunals and arbitrators being to the same brood. The entire scheme,
from its I.L.O. genesis, through the objects and Reasons, fits in only with arbitrators being covered
by Section 11A, unless Parliament cheated itself and the nation by proclaiming a great purpose
essential to industrial justice and, for no rhyme or reason and wittingly or unwittingly, withdrawing
one vital word. Every reason for clothing tribunals with Sec. 11A powers applies a fortiori to
arbitrators. Then why omit ? Could it be a synopic omission which did not affect the semantics
because a tribunal, in its wider connotation, embraced every adjudicatory organ, including an
arbitrator ? An economy of words is a legislative risk before a judiciary accustomed to the
Anglo-Saxon meticulousness in drafting. We may easily see meaning by one construction. A
‘tribunal’ is merely a seat of justice or a judicial body with jurisdiction to render justice. If an
arbitrator fulfils this functional role and he does -how can he be excluded from these scope of the
expression ? A caste distinction between courts, tribunals, arbitrators and others, is functionally
fallacious and, in our context, stems from confusion. The Section makes only a hierarchical, not
functional, difference by speaking of tribunals and national tribunals. So we see no ground to
truncate the natural meaning of 'Tribunal' on the supposed intent of Parliament to omit irrationally
the category of adjudicatory organs known as arbitrators. To cut down is to cripple and the art of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 35Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

interpretation makes whole, not mutilates, furthers the expressed purpose, not hampers, by narrow
literality.

Section 2(r) defines Tribunal thus:

'Tribunal' means an Industrial Tribunal constituted under Section 7A and includes an Industrial
Tribunal constituted before the 10th day of March, 1957, under this Act, Prima-facie it is a different
category from arbitrators but all statutory definitions are subject to contextual changes. It is
perfectly open. to the court to give the natural meaning to a word defined in the Act if the context in
which it appears suggests a departure from the definition because then there is something
repugnant in the subject or context.

Then what is the natural meaning of the expression "Tribunal"? A 'tribunal' literally means a seat of
justice. May be, justice is dispensed by a quasi-judicial body, an arbitrator, a commission, a court or
other adjudicatory organ created by the State. All these are tribunals and naturally the import of the
word embraces an arbitration tribunal. Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Vol. 4 p. 3093) speaks of
‘Tribunal in this, wider sense and quoted Fry, L.J. in Dawkins v. Rokeby [L.R. 8 Q.B. 255, affirmed,
LR. 7 H.L. 744]:

"I accept that, with this qualification that I do not like the word ‘tribunal’. The word
is, ambiguous, because it has not like 'court' any ascertainable meaning in English
law" (Royal Acsuarium v. Parkinson. [1892] Q.B. 431, cited COURT) .

There is a reference to the bishop's commission of enquiry as judicial tribunal and, significantly,
specific mention has been made in these terms.

"Disputes between employers and employees are A referred to such tribunals as the
Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, National Arbitration Tribunal and the Industrial
Disputes Tribunal". (Stroud's Judicial Dictionary p. 3094) We have hardly any doubt
that 'tribunal' simpliciter has a sweeping signification and does not exclude
‘arbitrator’.

Here we come upon a fundamental dilemma of interpretative technology vis-a-vis the judicative
faculty. What are the limits of statutory construction ? Does creativity in this jurisprudential area
permit travel into semantic engineering as substitute for verbalism ? It is increasingly important for
developing countries, where legislative transformation of the economic order is an urgent item on
the national agenda, to have the judiciary play a meaningful role in the constitutional revolution
without ferreting out laws in the draftsman, once the object and effect are plain. Judges may not be
too 'anglo-phonic' lest the system fail.

It is edifying to recall from Robert Stevens' Law and Politics of the House of Lords as a judicial body:

"Moreover, Macmillan, who began to specialize in the increasingly frequent tax
appeals, continued to develop this highly artificial approach in Inland Revenue

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 36Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

Commissioner v. Ayrshire Employers Mutual Insurance Association, when
Parliament had clearly intended to make the annual surpluses of mutual insurance
companies subject to tax, Macmillan found a particularly formalistic argument to
show that this had not been the effect of section 31 of the Finance Act of 1933. He was
then happily able to announce, "The Legislature has plainly missed. fire."(a). Of this
decision Lord Diplock was later to say that "if, as in this case, the Courts can identify
the target of Parliamentary legislation their proper function is to see that it is hit: not
merely to record that it has been missed. Here is judicial legislation at its worst."(3) '
We would rather adopt Lord Diplock's thought and have the court help hit the
legislative target, within limits, than sigh relief that the legislative fire has missed the
bull's eye. Of course, the social philosophy of the Constitution has, as ruled by this
court in several cases, a role in interpretative enlightenment and judicial value vision.

We may reinforce this liberal rule of statutory construction, being a matter of importance in the
daily work of the Court, by reference even to Roman Law from Justinian's days down to the
American Supreme Court. "Not all special cases can be contained in the laws and resolutions of the
Senate", said the Roman jurist Jullianus, "but where their meaning is manifest in some case, the one
who exercises jurisdiction must apply the provision analogously and in this way administer justice."
Prof. Bodenheimer has explained that Civil Law does not regard words as the sole basis of law but
allows it to be modified by purpose. "Celsus added the following admonition to these general
principles of interpretation: "The laws should be liberally interpreted, in order that their intent be
preserved".

"Samuel Thorne has shown that, during certain periods of English medieval history, the position of
the Common Law towards the construction of statutes was similar to the general attitude of the
Roman and Civil Law. Statutes were frequently extended to situations not expressly covered by
them."(3) Plowden pointed out that "when the words of a statute enact one thing, they enact all
other things which are in the like degree," Plowden demonstrated that a statutory remedy at that
time was deemed to be merely illustrative of other analogous cases that deserved to be governed by
the same principle.

"our law (like all others) consists of two parts, viz. OF body and soul, the letter of the law is the body
of the law, and the sense and reason of the law is the soul of the law.. And it often happens that when
you know the letter, you know not the sense, for sometimes the sense is more confined and
contracted than the letter, and sometimes it is more large and extensive"(5) Prof. Bodehheimer
states that the American trend is towards a purpose-oriented rather than a plain-meaning rule in its
rigid orthodoxy. In United States v. American Trucking Association. The U.S. Supreme Court wrote:

"When the plain meaning has led to absurd or futile results .. this Court has looked
beyond the words to the Purpose of the Act. Frequently, however, even when the
plain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one
"plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole" this Court has
followed that purpose rather than the literal words.

When aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there can
certainly be no "rule of law" which forbids its use, how ever, clear the words may be on "superficial
examination." B In the present case, as the narration of the facts unfolded, the reference of the
dispute was to an arbitrator. He reinvestigated and reassessed the evidence bearing on the guilt
of-the discharged workmen after giving an opportunity to both sides to adduce evidence thereon
Admittedly, he had this power. But had he the follow-up power, if he held the men guilty of punitive
misconduct, to reweigh the quantum of punishment having regard to the degree of culpability ? This
jurisdiction he enjoys if Sec. 11A includes ‘arbitrators’. This, in turn, flows from our interference as
to whether the word 'tribunal' takes in an adjudicatory organ like the arbitrator. It is plain that the
expression ‘arbitrator’ is not expressly mentioned in Section 11A. Nevertheless, if the meaning of the
word ‘tribunal’ is wider rather than narrower, it will embrace arbitrator as well. That is how the
dynamics of interpretation are, in one sense, decisive of the fate of the present appeal.

Competing interpretative angles have contended for judicial acceptance English preferences apart,
Indian socio- legal conditions must decide the choice in each situation. Sometimes Judges are prone
to castigate creative interpretation in preference to petrified literality by stating that Judges declare
the law and cannot make law. The reply to this frozen faith is best borne out by Lord Radcliffe's
blunt words:

" There was never a more sterile controversy than that upon the question whether a
judge makes law. Of course he does. How can he help it ?.... Judicial law is always a
reinterpretation of principles in the light of new combinations of facts.. Judges do not
reverse principles once well established, but they do modify them, extend them,
restrict them and even deny their application to the combination in hand.

Lord Devlin in his "Samples of Lawmaking", agreed that Judges are fashioners of law, if not creators
out of material supplied to them and went on to observe:

"If the House of Lords did not treat itself as bound by its own decisions, it might do
its own lopping and pruning .... and perhaps even a little grafting, instead of leaving
all that for the legislature. But it could not greatly alter the shape of the tree."

Even so eminent a Judge as Lord Reid leaned to the view that the law should be developed since it
was not static and, in this limited sense, Judges are law-makers although this view prevented
"technical minded Judges (from pressing) precedents to their logical conclusions". On the whole, a
just and humanist interpretative technique, meaning permitting, is the best. We do not mean to
conclude that Judges can take liberties with language ad libitem and it is wholesome to be cautious
as Lord Reid in Shaw v. D.P.P. warned: "Where Parliament fears to tread it is not for the courts to
rush in."

We are persuaded that there is much to learn from Lord Denning's consistent refrain about the
inevitable creative element in the judicial process in the interpretative area. We permit ourselves a
quote from Lord Denning because Shri A. K. Sen did draw our attention to straightening the creases
as permissible but not stitching the cloth, making a critical reference to the controversial activism of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 38Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

which Lord Denning was a leading light:

"The truth is that the law is uncertain. rt does not cover all the situations that may
arise. Time and again practitioners and judges are faced with new situations where
the decision may go either way. No one can tell what the law is until the courts
decides it. The judges do every day make law, though it is almost heresy to say so. If
the truth is recognized then we may hope to escape from the dead hand of the past
and consciously mould new principles to meet the needs of the present."

Mr. Justice Mathew in Kesavananda Bharti's case referred with approval-and so do we-to the
observations of Justice Holmes.

"I recognize without hesitation that Judges do and must legislate. but they can do so
only interstitially; they are confined from molar to molecular motions."

Arthur Selwyn Miller writes, "Some have called it (the Supreme A Court) the highest legislative
chamber in the nation. Although there is no question that the Court can and does make law, and
does so routinely, ..".

Assuming the above approach to be too creatively novel for traditionalism, let us approach the same
problem from a conventional angle authenticated by case-law. The question of construction of s. 11A
was argued at length, as to whether an omission of any reference to Arbitrator appointed under s.
10A in s. 11A would suggest that the Arbitrator under s. 10A, notwithstanding the terms of
reference, would not enjoy the power conferred on all conceivable industrial adjudicators under s.
11A. It was said, after referring to the objects and reasons in respect of the bill which was moved to
enact s. 11A in the Industrial Disputes Act, that while the I.L.O. had indicated that an arbitrator
selected by the parties for adjudication of industrial dispute must be invested with power by
appropriate legislation as found in s. 11A, the Parliament, while enacting the section in its wisdom,
did not include the Arbitrator even though other adjudicators of industrial disputes have been
conferred such power and, therefore, it is a case of Sasus omissions. Reliance was placed on
Gladstone v. Bower where the question arose whether a reference to a tenancy from year to year in s.
2(1) of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948 would also cover a tenancy for 18 months which could be
terminated at the end of the first year. The submission was that even though no notice was
necessary at common law because the tenancy would automatically terminate at the expiry of the
specified period of tenancy, the tenancy took effect as tenancy from year to year by virtue of S. 2(1)
of the Act so that it continued until terminated by notice to quit and, therefore the landlord was not
entitled to possession without notice. It was further contended that if a tenancy from year to year
was to get the protection of the Act it is inconceivable that tenancy for a longer duration would not
qualify for that protection. Court of Appeal negatived this contention holding that this is a case
simply of casus omissus and the Act is defective. The court further held that if it were ever
permissible for the Court to repair a defective Act of Parliament, the Court would be very glad to do
so in this case so far as the Court could. The Court will always allow the intention of a statute to
override the defects of wording buts the Court's ability to do so is limited by the recognised canons
of interpretation. The Court may, for example, prefer an alternative construc
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 39Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

tion which is less well-fitted to the words but better fitted to the intention of the Act. But here, for
the reasons given by the learned Judge, there is not alternative construction; it is simply a case of
something being overlooked. The Court cannot legislate for a casus omissions. To do so would be to
usurp the function of the legislature [see Magor & St. Mellons Rural District Council v. Newport
Corporation. Where the Statute's meaning is clear and explicit, words cannot be interpolated. Even
where the meaning of the statute is clear and sensible, either with or without the omitted word,
interpolation is improper, since the primary source of the legislative intent is in the language of the
statute [see Crawford's "Construction of Statutes". 1940 Edn., p. 269 extracted in S. Narayanaswami
v. G. Panneerselvam.] Undoubtedly, the Court cannot put into the Act words which 'are not
expressed, and which cannot reasonably he implied on any recognised principles of construction.
That would be a work of legislation, not of construction, and outside the province of the Court [see
Kamalaranjan v. Secretary of State(3).] Similarly, where the words of the statute are clear it would
not be open to the Court in order to obtain a desired result either to omit or add to the words of the
statute. This is not the function of the Court charged with a duty of construction. This approach has,
however, undergone a sea change as expressed by Denning, I.. J. in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v.
Asher wherein he observed as under:

"When a defect appears a Judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the
draftman. He must set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of
Parliament... and then he must supplement the written words so as to give ‘force and
life’ to the intention of legislature ...., A judge should ask himself the question how, if
the makers of the Act had themselves come across this ruck in the texture of it, they
would have straightened it out ? He must then do as they would have done. A judge
must not alter the material of which the Act is woven, but he can and should iron out
the creases."

(Approved in State of Bihar & Anr. v. Dr. Asis Kumar Mukherjee & ors. where in he observed as
under:

This long excursion has become important because, once in a while, social legislation which requires
sharing of social philosophy between the Parliament and the Judiciary; meets with its Waterloo in
the . higher courts because the true role of interpretation shifts from Judge to Judge. We are clearly
of the view that statutory construction which fulfills the mandate of the statute must find favour
with the Judges, except where the words and the context rebel against such , flexibility. We would
prefer to be liberal rather than lexical when reading the meaning of industrial legislation which
develops from day to day in the growing economy of India. The necessary conclusion from this
discussion is that the expression ‘tribunal’ includes, in the statutory setting, an arbitrator also.
Contemporaneous par-legislative material may legitimately be consulted when a word of wider
import and of marginal obscurity needs to be interpreted. So viewed, we are not in a 'sound-proof
system’ and the I.L.O. recommendation accepted by India. and the objects and Reasons of the
amending Act leave no doubt about the sense, policy and purpose. Therefore Section 11A applies to
the arbitrator in the present case and he has the power to examine whether the punishment imposed
in the instant case is excessive. So has the High Court, if the Award suffers from a fundamental flaw.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 40Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

A study of the lengthy award discloses no mention of Section 11A, and presumably, the authority was
unmindful of that provision while rendering the verdict. In a limited sense, even prior to Section
11A, there was jurisdiction for a labour tribunal, including an arbitrator, to go into the punitive
aspect of the Management's order. This Court has, in a catena of cases, held that a mala fide
punishment is bad in law and when the punishment is grotesquely condign or perversely harsh or
glaringly discriminatory, an easy inference of bad faith, unfair labour practice or victimisation
arises. The wider power tn examine or prescribe the correct punishment belongs to
tribunal/arbitrator even under Sec. 11 in no enquiry (or a defective enquiry which is bad, and,
therefore, can be equated with a 'no enquiry’ situation) has been held by the Management. For, then,
there is no extant order of guilt or punishment and the tribunal determines it fresh. In such a virgin
situation both culpability and quantification of punishment arc within the jurisdiction of the
tribunal/arbitrator. The present is such a case.

Volleys of rulings from both sides were fired during arguments, the target being the limited area of
the tribunal's power to overturn the quantum of punishment awarded by the Management. We do
not think it necessary to re-gurgitate all that has been said by this Court upto now, since it is
sufficient to bring out the correct law in the light of the leading citations. It is incontrovertible that
where, as here, no enquiry has been held by the Management, the entire subject is at large and both
guilt and punishment, in equal measure, may be determined, without inhibition of jurisdiction, by
the tribunal.

Lastly, as rightly urged by counsel for the Sabha, an arbitrator has all the powers the terms of
reference, to which both sides are party, confer. Here, admittedly, the reference is very widely
worded and includes the nature of the punishment. The law and the facts do not call for further
elaboration and we hold that, in any view, the arbitrator had the authority to investigate into the
propriety of the discharge and the veracity of the misconduct. Even if S. 11A is not applicable, an
Arbitrator under s. 10A is bound to act in the spirit of the legislation under which he is to function.
Acommercial arbitrator who derives his jurisdiction from the terms of reference will by necessary
implication, be bound to decide according to law and, when one says ‘according to law’, it only
means existing law and the law laid down by the Supreme Court being the law of the land, an
Arbitrator under s. 10A will have to decide keeping in view the spirit of S. 11A [See Union of India v.
Bungo Steel Furniture Pvt. Ltd. (1967)] 1 S.C.R. 324]. The Jurisdictional hurdles being thus cleared,
we may handle the basic facts and the divergences between the Arbitrator and the High Court before
moulding the final relief.

Prefatory to the discussion about the factum of misconduct and its sequel, we must remind
ourselves that the strike was illegal, having been launched when another industrial dispute was
pending adjudication. Sec. 23 (a) appears, at a verbal level, to convey such a meaning although the
ambit of sub-clause (a) may have to be investigated fully in some appropriate case in the light of its
scheme and rationale. It looks strange that the pendency of a reference on a tiny or obscure
industrial dispute-and they often pend too long-should block strikes on totally unconnected yet
substantial and righteous demands. The constitutional implications and practical complications of
such a veto of a valuable right to strike often leads not to industrial peace but to seething unrest and
lawless strikes. But in the present case, both before the arbitrator and the High Court, the parties

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 41Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

have proceeded, on the agreed footing that the strike was illegal under Section 23(a). We do not
reopen the issue at this late stage and assume the illegality of the strike.

The Fatal Flaw in the Award:

The Achilles heel of the arbitrator's award is where he makes, as a substitute for specific and
individuated findings of guilt and appropriate penalty vis-a-vis each workmen, a wholesale survey of
A the march of events, from tension to breakdown, from fair settlement to illegal and unjustified
strike, from futility of negotiation to readiness for arbitration, from offer of full re-employment to
partial taking back on application by workmen in sack cloth and ashes, by picking and choosing
after a humble declaration that the strike has been formally buried, from episodes of violence and
paralysis of production to backstage manoeuvres to get the factory taken over as a 'sick mill’, and
after a full glimpse of this scenario, holds that the Sabha was always in the wrong, and inevitably,
the Management was surely reasonable AND, ergo, every employee must individually bear the cross
of misconduct and suffer dismissal for the sins of the Sabha leadership-its secretary was not an
employee of the mill-by some sub-conscious doctrine of guilt by association! Non Sequitur.

Each link in the chain of facts has been challenged by the respondents but let us assume them to be
true, to test the strength of the legal fibre of the verdict. (We may mention by way of aside, D. that
the Company seems to be a well managed one.) The cardinal distinction in our punitive
jurisprudence between a commission of enquiry and a Court of Adjudication, between the
cumulative causes of a calamity and the specific guilt of a particular person, is that speaking
generally, we have rejected, as a nation, the theory of community guilt and collective punishment
and instead that no man shall be punished except for his own guilt. Its reflection in the disciplinary
jurisdiction is that no worker shall be dismissed save on proof of his individual delinquency. Blanket
attainder of a bulk of citizens on any vicarious theory for the gross sins of some only, is easy to apply
but obnoxious in principle. Here, the arbitrator has found the Sabha Leadership perverse, held that
the strikers should have reasonably reported for work and concluded that the Management had, for
survival, to make-do with new recruits. Therefore what ?

What, at long last, is the answer to the only pertinent question in 6. a disciplinary proceeding viz.
what is the specific misconduct against the particular workmen who is to lose his job and what is his
punitive desert? Here you can't generalise any more than a sessions judge can, by holding a faction
responsible for a massacre, sentence every denizen of that factions village to death penalty. The legal
error is fundamental, although lay instinct may not be outraged. What did worker A do ? Did he join
the strike or remain at home for fear of vengeance against blacklegs in a para- violent situation ? Life
and limb are dearer than loyalty, to the common run of men, and discretion is the 'better part of
valour. Surely, the Sabha complained of Management's goondas and the latter sought police aid
against the unruly core of strikers. In between, the ordinary rustic workmen might not have desired
to be branded blacklegs or become martyrs and would not have reported for work. If not being
heroic in daring to break through the strike cordon-illegal though the strike be-were misconduct, the
conclusion would have been different. Not reporting for work does not lead to an irrebuttable
presumption of active participation in the strike. More is needed to bring home the mens rea and
that burden is on the prosecutor, to wit the Management. Huddling together the eventful history of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 42Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

deteriorating industrial relations and perverse leadership of the Sabha is no charge against a single
worker whose job is at stake on dismissal. What did he do ? Even when lawyers did go on strike in
the higher Courts or organize a boycott, legally or illegally, even top law officers of the Central Govt.
did not attend court, argued Shri Tarkunde, and if they did not boycott but merely did not attend,
could workers beneath the bread line be made of sterner stuff. There is force in this pragmatic
approach. The strike being illegal is a non-issue at this level. The focus is on active participation.
Mere absence, without more, may not compel the conclusion of involvement.

Likewise, the further blot on the strike, of being unjustified, even if true, cuts no ice. Unjustified, let
us assume; so what? The real question is, did the individual worker, who was to pay the penalty,
actively involve himself in this unjustified misadventure ? or did he merely remain a quiescent
non-worker during that explosive period ? Even if he was a passive striker, that did not visit him
with the vice of activism in running an unjustified strike. In the absence of proof of being militant
participant the punishment may differ. To dismiss a worker, in an economy cursed by massive
unemployment, is a draconian measure as a last resort. Rulings of this Court have held that the
degree of culpability and the quantum of punishment turn on the level of participation in the
unjustified strike. Regrettably, no individualised enquiry has been made by the Arbitrator into this
significant component of delinquency. Did any dismissed worker instigate, sabotage or indulge in
vandalism or violence ?

The Management's necessity to move the mill into production for fear of being branded a 'sick unit’
is understandable. Of course, collective strike is economic pressure by cessation of work and not
exchange of pleasantries. It means embarrassing business. Such a quandary cannot alter the law.
Here the legal confusion is obvious.

No inquest into the Management's recruitment of fresh hands is being made at this stage. The
inquiry is into the personal turpitudes of particular workmen in propelling an illegal and unjustified
strike and the proof of their separate part therein meriting dismissal. The despair of the
Management cannot, by specious transformation of logic, be converted into the despair of each of
the 853 workmen. Sympathies shall not push one into fallacies.

We may now concretize this generalised criticism of the otherwise well-covered award. The crowd of
documents and camping attitudes must have added to the strain on the Arbitrator.

"A voluminous record of documents and correspondence has been produced before me by both
sides. There have been allegations and counter allegations made by both sides not only against each
other but even against the Police, the Department of Labour and persons in Authority. The history
has been sought to be traced right from the inception of the Company in 1966 or 1967, by the
Company to show that their conduct has been always proper and above reproach and by Sabha to
establish that not only the Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. were not fair to the employees but that every
action of theirs good or bad was ill- motivated, was executed with some sinister ulterior motives."

The Award set out the history of the Company, its vicissitudes, the hills and valleys, the lights and
shadows, of industrial relations with mob fury and lock-outs and allied episodes often ending in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 43Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

settlements and pious pledges. Then the Arbitrator stressed Clause 6 of the Agreement of December,
1971 which bespoke a no-strike zone for five years. There was reference to the Management's
promise to implement the Wage Board recommendations. The Arbitrator was upset that despite
Clause a strike was launched but was not disturbed that despite the Wage Board proposals,
negotiations were being baulked and an interminable arbitral alternative was being offered by the
Management. He exclaimed: "If such a settlement arrived at was not respected and implemented
the, machinery provided by law would lose all meaning and so also the sanctity of the word of the
Management or the word of the union. It is, therefore, essential tn ascertain who was responsible for
the breach of the agreement so solemnly entered into. 
Serious breach by management is alleged and this is given as a reason or is made as an cause for
getting rid of the obligations arising out of the agreement which specifically could not be terminated
for five years."

The narration continues and the following conclusion is reached:

"It is thus very clear that the company had fully discharged its obligation under the
agreement in respect of 64 discharged or dismissed workmen and the other workmen
and the allegation made by the Sabha of the company having made a breach thereof
is not correct."

We thus see, that at this stage, the arbitrator has merely made r) a generalised approach as if a
commission of inquiry were going into the conduct of the Management and the Sabha to discover
who was blameworthy in the imbroglio. The award then swiveled round to a study of the case of the
Sabha vis-a-vis the triple grievances, the Sabha had:

"I shall first deal with the grievance regarding demands for implementation of the
recommendations of the Wage Board".

The long and sterile correspondence was set out and the arbitrator arrived at the conclusion that the
insistence on reference to arbitration as against negotiation was justified on the part of the
Management:

"I, therefore, have accepted the version of: the Management and disbelieved the
motivated denial of the Sabha in this respect."

The culmination of the protracted discussion on the atmosphere and environment, rather than on
the actual charge against each worker, was recorded in the Award:

"I have exhaustively, perhaps more exhaustively than even necessary, dealt with the
allegations made by the Sabha that the Management had committed breach of
agreement by refusing to accede to the demand of the Sabha for implementation of
recommendations of the Wage Board. There appears to be no doubt that the
Management had agreed to implement the recommendation of the Wage Board.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 44Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

There is also not the least doubt the Management was ready and willing to implement
the recommendations of the Wage Board it was because it was prevented by . the
Sabha from doing so."

An analysis of the Management's conduct in the matter of non-implementation of the Wage Board
recommendation was thereafter made by the Arbitrator and he wound up thus :

"I am satisfied that the Company had not committed any breach of the settlement
dated 4-8-1972 at least so far as implementation of the recommendations of the
Wage Board is concerned."

The question of bonus for the year 1971 was also considered and dismissed and the Sabha's case to
that extent was negatived. Again, the plea for wages for the period of the lock-out was also negatived
with the observations :

"T fail to see how the Sabha can allege breach of the agreement dated 4-8-1972 in view
of the clear unequivocal terms contained in clause 4 of that Agreement."

In this strain the Award continued and the refrain was the same that the Sabha was in the wrong.
The Award even went to the exaggerated extent of morbidly holding that the workers were wearing
printed badges which, along with other circumstances, amounted to a breach of the agreement ! The
Award then moved on to the strike of January 27, 1973 because it led to the dismissal of all the
workmen. Until this stage, the arbitrator was merely painting the background and, at any rate, did
not engage himself in isolating or identifying any worker or any misconduct. He merely denounced
the Sabha, which is neither here nor there, in the matter of disciplinary proceedings against each
individual workman. He missed the meat of the matter. The relevant portion of the Award based on
generalisation proved this error :

"I am concerned herein with the question whether the discharge or dismissal of the
400 workmen was legal and proper or not and what relief to grant to them.
Approached from any point of view the action of the Company appears to me to be
legal, proper and justified and the demands on behalf of these workmen must be
rejected."

A condemnation of the Sabha and an approval of the Management's handling of the strike are miles
away from the issue on hand.

We observe here also an unfortunate failure to separate and scan the evidence with specific
reference to charges against individual workman. On the contrary, all that we find in the award is an
autopsy of the strike by the Sabha and a study of its allegedly perverse postures. A disciplinary
inquiry resulting in punishment of particular delinquents cannot but be illegal if the evidence is of
mass misconduct by unspecified strikers led by leaders who are perhaps not even workmen. We are
constrained to state that pointed consideration of facts which make any of the 400 workmen guilty,
is a search in vain. The award being ex facie blank from this vital angle, the verdict must prima facie

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 45Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

rank as void since vicarious guilt must be brought home against the actively participating members
of a collectivity by positive testimony, not by hunch, suspicion or occult intuition. The short position
is this. Is there a punishment of any workman ? If yes, has it been preceded by an enquiry ? If not,
does not the Management desire to prove the charge before the tribunal ? If yes, what is the
evidence, against whom, of what misconduct ? If individuated proof be forthcoming and relates to
an illegal strike, the further probe is this : was the strike unjustified ? If yes, was the accused worker
an active participant therein ? If yes, what role did he play and of what acts was he author ? Then
alone the stage is set for a just punishment. These exercises, as an assembly line process are
fundamental. Generalisation of a violent strike of a vicious Union leadership, of strikers fanatically
or foolishly or out of fear, failing to report for work, are good background material. Beyond that,
these must be identified by a rational process, the workmen, their individual delinquency and the
sentence according to their sin. Sans that, the dismissal is bad. Viewed from this perspective, the
Award fails.

The Arbitrator comes to grips with the core question of discharge simpliciter versus dismissal as
punishment but not with the identification of delinquents and delinquency. After referring to Order
23 of the Model Standing Orders he goes on to state the law correctly by extracting observations
from the Assam Oil Company case.

Another vital facet of industrial law is that when no enquiry has been held by the Management
before imposing a punishment (or the enquiry held is defective and bad), the whole field of
delinquency and consequent penalty is at large for the tribunal. Several rulings support this logic.
We are constrained to hold that a certain observation made per incuriam by Mr. Justice
Vaidyalingam, strongly relied on by Sri A. K. Sen, does not accurately represent the law, although
the learned Judge had earlier stated the law and case-law correctly, if we may say so with respect.

A selective study of the case-law is proper at this place. Before we do this, a few words on the basis of
the right to strike and progressive legal thinking led by constitutional guidelines is necessitous. The
right to unionise, the right to strike as part of collective bargaining and, subject to the legality and
humanity of the situation, the right of the weaker group, viz., labour, to pressure the stronger party,
viz., capital, to negotiate and render justice, are processes recognised by industrial jurisprudence
and supported by Social Justice. While society itself, in its basic needs of existence, may not be held
to ransom in the name of the right to bargain and strikers must obey civilised norms in the battle
and not be vulgar or violent hoodlums, Industry, represented by intransigent Managements, may
well be made to reel into reason by the strike weapon and cannot then squeal or wail and complain
of loss of profits or other ill-effects but must negotiate or got a reference made. The broad basis is
that workers are weaker although they are the producers and their struggle to better their lot has the
sanction of the rule of law. Unions and strikes are no more conspiracies than professions and
political parties are, and, being far weaker, need succour. Part IV of the Constitution, read with Art.
19, sows the seeds of this burgeoning jurisprudence. The Gandhian quote at the beginning of this
judgement sets the tone of economic equity in Industry. Of course, adventurist, extremist,
extraneously inspired and puerile strikes, absurdly insane persistence and violent or scorched earth
policies boomerang and are anathema for the law. Within these parameters the right to strike is
integral to collective bargaining.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 46Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

Responsible trade unionism is an instrument of concerted action and the laissez faire law that all
strikes are ipso facto conspiracies, is no longer current coin even in Adam Smith's English country.
Lord Chorley, in Modern Law Review, Vol. 28, 1965, p. 451, is quoted as saying that law must be
altered as a consequence of Rookes v. Barnard, so as to remove the effects of decisions of conspiracy
and intimidation. He goes on to state that Allen v. Flood and Quinn v. Leathem taking the
conspiratorial view must never be permitted to be quoted in courts. In contrast, reference was made
to Willis on Constitutional Law, pp. 878-879, wherein the Supreme Court of America reflects the
impact of capitalistic development and the economic views of the judges and the fact that the judges
are members of a social order and a social product and the decisions are due more to the capitalistic
system and the world of ideas in which the judges live. Our Constitution is clear in its mandate, what
with Art. 39A superadded and we have to act in tune with the values enshrined therein.

The benign attitude towards strike being what we have outlined, the further question arises whether
in the light of the accepted finding that the strike as such was illegal and, further, was unjustified, all
the strikers should face the penalty of dismissal or whether individual cases with special reference to
active participation in the strike, should be considered. A rapid but relevant glance at the decided
cases may yield dividends. In India General Navigation and Railway Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen,
(supra) this court did observe that if a strike is illegal, it cannot be called 'perfectly justified’. But,
between 'perfectly justified’ and 'unjustified' the neighbourhood is distant. More illegality of the
strike does not per se spell unjustifiability. For, in Crompton Greaves Ltd. v. Workmen (supra) this
Court held that even if a strike be illegal, it cannot be castigated as unjustified, unless the reasons for
it are entirely perverse or unreasonable-an aspect which has to be decided on the facts and
circumstances of each case. In that decision, this Court awarded wages during the strike period
because the Management failed to prove that the workmen resorted to force and violence. Even in
India General Navigation and Railway Co. Ltd. (supra) where the strike was illegal and affected a
public utility service, this Court observed that "the only question of practical importance which may
arise in the case of an illegal strike, would be the kind or quantum of punishment, and that, of
course, has to be modulated in accordance with the facts and circumstances of each case.... There
may be reasons for distinguishing the case of those who may have acted as mere dumb-driven cattle
from those who have taken an active part in fomenting the trouble and instigating workmen to join
such a strike or have taken recourse to violence." The court after holding that the strike was illegal
"and that it was not even justified" made a pregnant observation :

"To determine the question of punishment, a clear distinction has to be made
between those workmen who are only joined in such a strike, but also took part in
obstructing the loyal workmen from carrying on their work, or took part in violent
demonstrations, or acted in defiance of law and order, on the one hand, and those
workmen who were more or less silent participators in such a strike, on the other
hand. It is not in the interest of the industry that there should be a wholesale
dismissal of all the workmen who merely participated in such a strike. It is certainly
not in the interest of the workmen themselves. An Industrial Tribunal, therefore, has
to consider the question of punishment, keeping in view the overriding consideration
of the full and efficient working of the Industry as a whole. The punishment of
dismissal or termination of services, has, therefore, to be imposed on such workmen

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 47Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

as had not only participated in the illegal strike, but had fomented it, and had been
guilty of violence or doing acts detrimental to the maintenance of law and order in
the locality where work had to be carried on."

After noticing the distinction between peaceful strikers and violent strikers, Sinha, J., in that case,
observed "it must be clearly understood by those who take part in an illegal strike that thereby they
make themselves liable to be dealt with by their employers. There may be reasons for distinguishing
the case of those who may have acted as mere dumb driven cattle from those who have taken an
active part in fomenting the trouble and instigating workmen to join such a strike, or have taken
recourse to violence." The same line of dichotomy is kept up :

"Both the types of workmen may have been equally guilty of participation in the
illegal strike, but it is manifest that both are not liable to the same kind of
punishment."

Significantly, the Court stressed the need for individual chargesheet being delivered to individual
workmen so that the degree of misconduct of each and the punitive deserts of each may be
separately considered. We may as well refer to a few more rulings since considerable argument was
expended on this point.

This Court in M/s. Burn & Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen & Ors.(1) clearly laid down that mere
participation in the strike would not justify the suspension or dismissal of workmen particularly
where no clear distinction can be made between those persons and the very large number of
workmen who had been taken back into service although they had participated in the strike. After
referring to the ratio in M/s. Burn & Co. Ltd. case, this Court in Bata Shoe Co. (P) Ltd. v. D.N.
Ganguly & Ors.(2) observed that there is no doubt that if an employer makes an unreasonable
discrimination in the matter of taking back employees there may in certain circumstances be reason
for the industrial tribunal to interfere; but the circumstances of each case have to be examined
before the tribunal can interfere with the order of the employer in a properly held managerial
inquiry on the ground of discrimination. The Court then proceeded to determine the facts placed
before it. Sri Sen specifically pointed out that in the Bata Shoe Co.'s case this Court distinguished the
decision in India General Navigation & Railway Co. Ltd.'s and observed that the decision in that case
was on the facts placed before the Court. In fact, Bata Shoe Co.'s case does not lay down any distinct
proposition about the treatment to be meted out to participants in strike and actually it is a decision
on its own facts.

In The Swadeshi Industries Ltd. v. Its Workmen(1), the Management after holding that the strike
was illegal, terminated the services of 230 workmen without framing any chargesheet or holding any
enquiry. It was contended that the strike was not legal. The Court observed that collective
bargaining for securing improvement on matters like basic pay, dearness allowance, bonus,
provident fund and gratuity leave and holidays was the primary object of a trade union and when
demands like these were put forward and thereafter a strike was resorted to in an attempt to induce
the company to agree to the demands or at least to open negotiations the strike must prima facie be
considered justified. As the order of termination was found to be illegal it was held that

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 48Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

reinstatement with back wages must follow as a matter of course, not necessarily because new hands
had not been inducted.

In I. M. H. Press, Delhi v. Additional Industrial Tribunal Delhi & Ors.,(2) this Court was called upon
to examine the ratio in Model Mills(3) case and India General Navigation & Railway Co. Ltd. case
and this Court in terms affirmed the ratio in India General Navigation & Railway Co. Ltd. case
observing that mere taking part in an illegal strike without anything further would not justify the
dismissal of all the workmen taking part in the strike.

In Indian Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. & Anr. v. Their Workmen(4), this Court observed that the
management of a concern has power to direct its own internal administration and discipline but the
power is not unlimited and when a dispute arises, Industrial Tribunals have been given the power to
see whether the termination of service of a workman is justified and to give appropriate relief. It
may be noticed that the decision is prior to introduction of s. 11A. It would thus appear that the
important effect of omission to hold an enquiry was merely this that the tribunal would have to
consider not only whether there was a prima facie case but would decide for itself on the evidence
adduced whether the charges have been made out. A defective enquiry in this connection stood on
the same footing as no enquiry and in either case the tribunal would have jurisdiction to go into the
entire matter and the employer would have to satisfy the tribunal that on the facts the order of
dismissal or discharge was proper. (see Workmen of Motipur Sugar Factory (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Motipur
Sugar Factory(1), and Provincial Transport Service v. State Industrial Court) (2). Once, therefore, it
was held that the enquiry was not proper, it was irrelevant whether the workman withdrew from the
enquiry or participated in it, the decision had to be on appraisal of evidence, and if it was found that
the enquiry was not proper the whole case was open before the labour court to decide for itself
whether the charge of misconduct was proved and what punishment should be awarded (see
Imperial Tabacco Company of India Ltd. v. Its Workmen) (3).

As against the above propositions, Sri Sen relied upon the observations of this Court in Oriental
Textile Finishing Mills, Amritsar v. Labour Court, Jullundur & Ors.(4). We fail to see how it runs
counter to the established principle. The Court, in fact, held that even where the strike is illegal,
before any action was taken with a view to punishing the strikers a domestic enquiry must be held.
Even though the Standing Orders prescribing enquiry before punishment did not provide for any
such enquiry the Court held that nonetheless a domestic enquiry should have been held in order to
entitle the management to dispense with the service of the workmen on the ground of misconduct,
viz., participation in the illegal strike. After so saying, the Court agreed with the view of the Court in
Indian General Navigation & Railway Co. Ltd. case and reaffirmed the principle that mere taking
part in an illegal strike without anything further would not necessarily justify the dismissal of all the
workers taking part in the strike and that if the employer, before dismissing a workman, gave him
sufficient opportunity of explaining his conduct and no question of mala fides or victimisation arose,
it was not for the tribunal in adjudicating the propriety of such dismissal to look into the sufficiency
or otherwise of the evidence led before the enquiry officer or insist on the same degree of proof as
was required in a court of law, as if it were sitting in appeal over the decision of the employer.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 49Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

Another aspect of this case emphasised that it could not be dogmatised as a matter of law that an
overt act such as intimidation or instigation or violence was necessary in order to justify termination
of service for participating in an illegal strike. On the facts of that case, even though it was found
that no domestic enquiry was held, reinstatement was refused on the ground that misconduct was
made out.

Sri Sen, of course, relied on this judgment to show that where a strike was resorted to and the
workers were called upon to join service within the stipulated time, on their failure it was open to
the company to employ new hands. This is reading more into the ruling than is warranted.

We cannot agree that mere failure to report for duty, when a strike is on, necessarily means
misconduct. Many a workman, as a matter of prudence, may not take the risk of facing the militant
workmen or the Management's hirelings for fear, especially when there is evidence in the case from
the Sabha that the Management had hired goondas and from the Management that the striking
vanguard was violent. It is also possible, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that several
workmen might not be posted with the Management's notice of recall or the terms on which they
were being recalled. In this view, we are not able to uphold the conclusion of the arbitrator that the
punishment of dismissal was appropriate for the entire mass of workmen whose only guilt, as
proved was nothing more than passive participation in the illegal and unjustified strike by not
reporting for duty. The verdict is inevitable that the discharge is wrongful.

The only comment we reluctantly make about the otherwise thorough award of the Arbitrator is that
omnibus rhetoric about the obnoxious behaviour of a class may not make-do for hard proof of
specific acts of particular persons where a punitive jurisdiction is exercised.

What, then, is the normal rule in the case of wrongful dismissal when the workmen claim
reinstatement with full back wages ? The High Court has held the discharge wrongful and directed
restoration with an equitable amount of back wages. The following rulings of this Court, et al, deal
with this subject :

The recent case of Hindustan Tin Works v. Its Employees (1) sets out the rule on reinstatement and
back wages when the order of this Court, et al, deal with this subject :

"It is no more open to debate that in the field of industrial jurisprudence a
declaration can be given that the termination of service is bad and the workman
continues to be in service. The spectre of common law doctrine that contract of
personal service cannot be specifically enforced or the doctrine of mitigation of
damages does not haunt this branch of law. The relief of reinstatement with
continuity of service can be granted where termination of service is found to be
invalid. It would mean that the employer has taken away illegally the right to work of
the workman contrary to the relevant law or in breach of contract and simultaneously
deprived the workman of his earnings. If thus the employer is found to be in the
wrong as a result of which the workman is directed to be reinstated, the employer
could not shirk his responsibility of paying the wages which the workmen has been

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 50Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

deprived of by the illegal or invalid action of the employer. Speaking realistically,
where termination of service is questioned as invalid or illegal and the workman has
to go through the gamut of litigation, his capacity to sustain himself throughout the
protracted litigation is itself such an awesome factor that he may not survive to see
the day when law's proverbial delay has become stupefying. If after such a protracted
time and energy consuming litigation during which period the workman just sustains
himself, ultimately he is to be told that though he will be reinstated, he will be denied
the back wages which would be due to him, the workman would be subjected to a sort
of penalty for no fault of his and it is wholly undeserved. Ordinarily therefore, a
workman whose service has been illegally terminated would be entitled to full back
wages except to the extent he was gainfully employed during the enforced idleness.
That is the normal rule. Any other view would be a premium on the unwarranted
litigative activity of the employer. If the employer terminates the service illegally and
the termination is motivated as in this case, viz., to resist the workmen's demand for
revision of wages, the termination may well amount to unfair labour practice. In such
circumstances reinstatement being the normal rule it should be followed with full
back wages. Articles 41 and 43 of the Constitution would assist us in reaching a just
conclusion in this respect.............. In the very nature of things there cannot be a
strait-jacket formula for awarding relief of back wages. All relevant considerations
will enter the verdict. More or less, it would be a motion addressed to the discretion
of the Tribunal. Full back wages would be the normal rule and the party objecting to
it must establish the circumstances necessitating departure. At that stage the
Tribunal will exercise its discretion keeping in view all the relevant circumstances."

Dealing with the complex of considerations bearing on payment of back wages the new perspective
emerging from Art. 43A cannot be missed, as explained in Hindustan Tin Works, Labour is no more
a mere factor in production but a partner in Industry, conceptually speaking, and less than full back
wages is a sacrifice by those who can best afford and cannot be demanded by those, who least
sacrifice their large 'wages' though can best afford, if financial constraint is the ground urged by the
latter (Management) as inability to pay full back pay to the former. The morality of law and the
constitutional mutation implied in Art. 43A bring about a new equation in industrial relations.
Anyway, in the Hindustan Tin Works' case 75 per cent of the past wages was directed to be paid.
Travelling over the same ground by going through every precedent is supererogatory and we hold
the rule is simple that the discretion to deny reinstatement or pare down the quantum of back wages
is absent save for exceptional reasons.

It must be added however that particular circumstances of each case may induce the court to modify
the direction in regard to the quantum of back wages payable as happened in the India General
Navigation and Railway Co. Ltd. vs. Their Workmen (Supra). We may, therefore, have to consider,
when finally moulding the relief, what, in this case, we should do regarding reinstatement and back
wages. A Sum-up We may now crystallise our conclusions in the light of the long discussion. The
basic assumption we make is that the strike was not only illegal but also unjustified. On the latter
part, a contrary view cannot be ruled out in the circumstances present but we do not reinvestigate
the issue since the High Court has proceeded on what both sides have taken for granted. The

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 51Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

Management, in our view, did punish its 853 workmen when it discharged them for reasons of
misconduct set out in separate but integrated proceedings, even though, with legal finesse, the
formal order was phrased in harmless verbalism. But fine words butter no parsnips, and law, in its
intelligent honesty, must be blunt and when it sees a spade, must call it a spade. The action taken
under the general law or the standing orders, was illegal in the absence of individualised
chargesheets, proper hearing and personalised punishment, if found guilty. None of these steps
having been taken, the discharge orders were still born. But the Management could, as in this case it
did, offer to make out the delinquency of the employees and the arbitrator had, in such cases, the
full jurisdiction to adjudge de novo both guilt and punishment. We hold that sec. 11A does take in an
arbitrator too, and, in this case, the arbitral reference, apart from sec. 11A, is plenary in scope.

In the second chapter of our sum-up, the first thing we decide is that Art. 226, however restrictive in
practice, is a power wide enough, in all conscience, to be a friend in need when the summons comes
in a crisis from a victim of injustice; and, more importantly, this extraordinary reserve power is
unsheathed to grant final relief without necessary recourse to a remand. What the tribunal may, in
its discretion, do, the High Court too, under Art. 226, can, if facts compel, do. Secondly, we hold that
the Award suffers from a fundamental flaw that it equates an illegal and unjustified strike with
brazen misconduct by every workman without so much as identification of the charge against each,
the part of each, the punishment for each, after adverting to the gravamen of his misconduct
meriting dismissal. Passive participation in a strike which is both illegal and unjustified does not
ipso facto invite dismissal or punitive discharge. There must be active individual excess such as
master-minding the unjustified aspects of the strike, e.g., violence, sabotage or other reprehensible
role. Absent such gravamen in the accusation, the extreme economic penalty of discharge is wrong.
An indicator of the absence of such grievous guilt is that the Management, after stating in strong
terms all the sins of the workmen, took back over 400 of them as they trickled back slowly and
beyond the time set, with continuity of service, suggestive of the dubiety of the inflated accusations
and awareness of the minor role of the mass of workmen in the Engineers strike. Furthermore, even
though all sanctions short of punitive discharge may be employed by a Management, in our current
conditions of massive unemployment, low wages and high cost of living, dismissal of several
hundreds, with disastrous impact on numerous families, is of such sensitive social concern that, save
in exceptional situations, the law will inhibit such a lethal step for the peace of the Industry, the
welfare of the workmen and the broader justice that transcends transient disputes. The human
dimensions have decisional relevance. We hold the discharge orders, though approved by the
Arbitrator, invalid.

The last part of our conclusions relates to the relief which must be fashioned with an eye on mutual
equities. We cannot ignore a few raw realities since law is not dogmatics but pragmatics, without
temporising on principle. The Management's limitations in absorbing all the large number of
discharged employees all at once when, steel, the raw material, is scarce, is a problem. Likewise,
their inability to pay huge sums by way of back wages or otherwise, without crippling the progress of
the industry, cannot be overlooked but cannot be overplayed after Hindustan Tin Works. Another
factor which cannot be wished away is the presence of over a couple of hundred workmen, with
varying lengths of service, who may have to be sacked if the old workmen are to be brought back. It
is a problem of humanist justice. Lastly, the rugged fact of life must not be missed that some of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 52Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

workmen during the long years of desperate litigation, might have sought jobs elsewhere and most
of them perhaps have, for sheer survival, made at least a starving wage during the prolonged idle
interval. This factor too is a weak consideration, tested by the reasoning in Hindustan Tin Works.
Moreover, rationalisation of re-absorption of the removed workmen requires attention to the
classification of permanent workmen and their casual counterparts. Every proposal must be
bottomed on the basic economic fact that the beneficiaries are from the many below the destitution
line. This Court has, in a very different context though, has drawn attention to the Gandhian
guideline:

"Whenever you are in doubt .. apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest
and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you
contemplate is going to be of any use of him."

It is apt here.

This perspective informs our decision. What did the High Court do regarding reinstatement and
should we modify and why? If the discharge is bad, reinstatement is the rule. In India General Navi
gation, Punjab National Bank and Swadeshi Industries, et al, restoration, despite large numbers,
was directed. But most rules have exceptions wrought by the pressure of life and Oriental, was relied
on to contend that reinstatement must be denied. There is force in the High Court's reasoning to
distinguish Oriental, as we hinted earlier and we quote:

"There were only 22 workmen involved in that case. The management had made
genuine and persistent efforts to persuade the concerned workmen to call of the
strike and join work. Those efforts were made at three different stages, namely, (1)
immediately after the workers went on the lightening strike and before chargesheets
were issued, (2) after the charges were dropped and individual notices were sent to
the workmen asking them to resume work by specified dates and (3) after the orders
of termination were served and conciliation proceedings were commenced pursuant
to the demand notice. But this is not all. Even the Labour Officer and Labour
Inspector had tried to persuade the concerned workmen to joint duty before the
charge-sheet came to be issued. As against these repeated bona fide attempts on the
part of the management and an outside agency to persuade the erring workmen, they
not only did not resume work but also failed to acknowledge or send a reply to the
individual notices served upon them requesting them to resume work and they
appear to have made it a condition precedent to their joining duty that the suspended
workmen should also be taken back. Even under such circumstances, the
management did not straightaway terminate their services but gave individual
notices requiring the concerned workmen to show cause why their names should not
be struck off and asked them to submit their reply by a certain date. Even those
notices were not replied. It is only thereafter that the services of the concerned
workmen came to be terminated. It is against this background that the Supreme
Court held that there was "a persistent and obdurate refusal by the workmen to joint

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 53Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

duty" notwithstanding the fact that "the management has done everything possible to
persuade them and give them opportunities to come back to work" and that they had
without any sufficient cause refused to do so which constituted "misconduct" so as to
‘justify the termination of their services".

",...If the workmen had been approached individually, not only those amongst them
who were unwilling to join strike but were prevented from joining work would have
taken courage to resume duty but even those amongst them who were undecided
could also have been won over. That apart, those notices, as their contents disclose,
were hardly persuasive efforts. They were a mixture of ultimatums, threats,
complaints and indictment of the workmen and the Sabha. Was it, therefore, a
genuine effort on the part of a keenly desirous employer to offer an olive branch? In
Oriental, orders of termination were passed only after giving individual notices to the
concerned workmen to showcause why their names should not be struck off. Besides,
those notices were given after charges formally served upon each workmen earlier
were dropped and persuasive efforts made in the meantime had failed. None of those
steps was taken herein. All that happened was that in one of the notices meant for
mass consumption and circulation, such intimation was given."

Even so, during the several years of the pendency of the dispute, surely some workmen would have
secured employment elsewhere as was conceded by counsel at a certain stage, and it is not equitable
to recall them merely to vindicate the law especially when new workmen already in precarious
service may have to be evicted to accommodate them. In the course of the debate at the Bar we
gained the impression that somewhere around a hundred workmen are likely to be alternatively
employed. Hopefully, there is no hazard in this guess.

Another, facet of the relief turns on the demand for full back wages. Certainly, the normal rule, on
reinstatement, is full back wages since the order of termination is non est. [see Lad's case(1) and
Panitole Tea Estate's case(2)]. Even so, the industrial court may well slice off a part if the workmen
are not wholly blameless or the strike is illegal and unjustified. To what extent wages for the long
interregnum should be paid is, therefore, a variable dependent on a complex of circumstances. [See
for e.g. 1967 (15) F.L.R. 395 paras 3 and 4].

We are mindful of the submission of Sri Tarkunde, urged in the connected appeal by the Sabha, that
where no enquiry has preceded a punitive discharge and the tribunal, for the first time, upholds the
punishment this Court has in D. C. Roy v. The presiding Officer, Madhya Pradesh Industrial Court,
Indore & Ors.(1) taken the view that full wages must be paid until the date of the award. There
cannot be any relation back of the date of dismissal to when the Management passed the void order.

Kalyani(2) was cited to support the view of relation back of the Award to the date of the employer's
termination orders. We do not agree that the ratio of Kalyani corroborates the proposition
propounded. Jurisprudentially, approval is not creative but confirmatory and therefore relates back.
A void dismissal is just void and does not exist. If the Tribunal, for the first time, passes an order
recording a finding of misconduct and thus breathes life into the dead shall of the Management's

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 54Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

order, predating of the nativity does not arise. The reference to Sasa Musa in Kalyani enlightens this
position. The latter case of D. C. Roy v. The Presiding Officer, Madhya Pradesh Industrial Court,
Indore & Ors. (supra) specifically refers to Kalyani's case and Sasa Musa's case and holds that where
the Management discharges a workmen by an order which is void for want of an enquiry or for
blatant violation of rules of natural justice, the relation-back doctrine cannot be invoked. The
jurisprudential difference between a void order, which by a subsequent judicial resuscitation comes
into being de novo, and an order, which may suffer from some defects but is not still born or void
and all that is needed in the law to make it good is a subsequent approval by a tribunal which is
granted, cannot be obfuscated.

We agree that the law stated in D. C. Roy (supra) is correct but now that the termination orders are
being set aside, the problem does not present itself directly. Even the other alternative submission of
Sri Tarkunde that if the plea of the Management that the order is a discharge simpliciter were to be
accepted, the result is a retrenchment within the meaning of s. 2(00) which, in this case, is in
violation of s. 25F and therefore bad, is not a point urged earlier. We are disposed to stand by the
view that discharge, even where it is not occasioned by a surplus of hands, will be retrenchment,
having regard to the breadth of the definition and its annotation in 1977 1 SCR 586. But the milieu in
which the order was passed in February 1973 is not fully available, viewed from this new angle. So
we decline to go into that contention.

Final Relief We are concerned with 400 workmen, some of whom have been claimed by death or
other irreversible causes- casualties of litigative longevity ! are 370 workmen are left behind, of
whom 239 are admittedly permanent. We have already stated that 100, out of them, are probably
fixed up elsewhere. So, we exclude them and direct that the remaining 139 alone will be reinstated.
A list of the aforesaid 100 workmen will be furnished to the Management by the Sabha within two
weeks from today. That shall be accepted as correct and final.

While reinstatement is refused for these 100 workmen, when shall they be deemed to have ceased to
be in service for drawal of terminal benefits ? Their discharge orders having been quashed, they
remain in service until today. We concluded the arguments on August 3, 1979 and on the eve of the
closure of counsel's submissions certain inconclusive settlement proposals were discussed. We,
therefore, consider August 3, 1979 as a pivotal point in the calender with reference to which the final
relief may be moulded. We direct that the 100 workmen for whom reinstatement is being refused
will be treated as in service until August 3, 1979 on which date they will be deemed to have been
retrenched. We direct this step with a view to pragmatise the situation in working out the equities.
These 100 will draw all terminal benefits plus 75 per cent of the back wages. This scaling down of
back pay is consistent with the assumption that somewhere in the past they had secured alternative
employment. The long years and the large sum payable also persuade us to make this minor cut. Of
course, in addition, they will be entitled to retrenchment benefits under s. 25F of the Act, and one
month's notice pay.

The remaining 139 will be awarded 50 per cent of the back wages since we are restoring them. The
High Court has adopted this measure and so we do not depart from it. The case of the hundred

stands on a slightly different footing, because some compensation in lieu of refusal of reinstatement

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 55Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

is due to them and that also has entered our reckoning while fixing 75 per cent for them. The
computation of the wages will be such as they would have drawn had they continued in service and
on that the cut directed will be applied.

We have disposed of the case of the permanent workmen except to clarify that in their case
continuity of service will be maintained and accrual of benefits on that footing reckoned. The next
category relates to casual employees, 131 in number of whom 57 have less than nine months' service.
The policy of the Act draws a distinction between those with service of 240 days and more and
others with less. The casuals with less than nine months service are 57 in number and we do not
think that this fugitive service should qualify for reinstatement especially when we find a number of
intermediate recruits, with longer though untenable service, have to be baled out. We decline
reinstatement of these 57 hands. The other 74 must be reinstated although nationally but wrongly
they are shown as casual. In the ‘life’ sense, all mortals are casuals but in the legal sense, those with
a record of 240 days on the rolls, are a class who have rights under industrial law. We direct the 74
long-term casuals aforesaid to be reinstated but not the 57 short-term ones. To this extent, we vary
the High Court's order.

We adopt the directive of the High Court regarding the back wages to both categories of casuals
except that for the lesser class of 57 casuals, a flat sum of 1000/- more will be paid as a token
compensation in lieu of reinstatement. The reinstated casuals (74 of them) will be put back as
casuals but will be confirmed within six months from the date of rejoining since it is meaningless to
keep them as casual labourers when they are, by sheer length of service, on the regular rolls.

Two issues remain When are the workmen to be retaken and what is to happen in the meanwhile ?
How is the amount payable by the Management to be discharged and on what terms ? Many years
have flowed by, thanks to the long-drawn-out litigation. Further delay in putting back the workers
will be unfair. But the Management pleads that steel shortage cuts into the flesh of the factory's
expansion, without which additional intake of workers is beyond their budget unless considerable
time for reabsorption were given. But the lot of the workmen is unspeakable while the overall assets
and outlook of the Company are commendable enough to bear an increased wage bill. Divas cannot
complain when Lazarus asks for more crumbs. Even if a slight slant be made in favour of the
Management, the direction to them to take back, in order of seniority, the first 70 out of the 139
permanent workmen on or before December 31, 1979 and the rest on or before March 31, 1980 is the
least that is just. Until those dates the workmen will be paid 2/3rd of their wages as now due. Of
course, if any workmen fails to report for work within 15 days of service of written notice to him,
with simultaneous copy to the Sabha, he will not be eligible for any more reinstatement or wages.

The back wages run into a large sum but a good part has been paid under the stay order of this
Court. We make it clear that the payments made will be given credit and the balance if paid as
directed below and within the time specified will not carry interest. If default is made, the sums in
default will carry 10 per cent interest.

The figures of amounts due will be worked out by both sides and put into Court in 10 days from now.
Half the amount determined by the Court, after perusing both statements, will be paid directly to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 56Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

the workmen or deposited with the Industrial Tribunal who will give notice and make
disbursements, on or before 31-3-1980 and the other half on or before 30-9-1980.

The conclusions may be capsulated for easier consumption.

1. Out of 370 workmen directed to be reinstated by the High Court, 239 are permanent. It is
assumed that 100 have found alternative employment and are not interested any more in
reinstatement and they are to be excluded from the direction of reinstatement. The Company must,
therefore, reinstate 139 permanent workmen and the list of 100 workmen who are not to be
reinstated would be supplied by the Sabha within two weeks from the date of this judgment. The
discharge order in respect of 100 workmen herein-before mentioned would be set aside and they are
deemed to be in service till August 3, 1979, when they will be retrenched and they will be paid
retrenchment compensation as provided in s. 25F plus one month's pay in lieu of notice, the
compensation to be worked out on the basis of the wages that will be admissible under the
recommendations of the Engineering Wage Board as applicable to the Company. This amount will
be paid in lieu of reinstatement and they will also be paid 75 per cent of the back wages.

2. The remaining 139 permanent employees would be paid 50 per cent of the back wages as directed
by the High Court.

3. 70 out of 139 permanent workmen directed to be reinstated should be provided actual
employment on or before December 31, 1979, and the rest on or before March 31, 1980. During this
period and till the actual reinstatement each one of these 139 workmen should be paid 2/3 of the
monthly wages from August 9, 1979, when the hearing in this case concluded. 50 per cent of the
amount that becomes payable to each workmen under the directions herein above given will be paid
on or before March 31, 1980, and the balance on or before September 30, 1980, and till then the
amount will carry interest at the rate of 10 per cent.

4. In respect of casual workmen whose service was less than 9 months on the date of dismissal it
would not be proper to grant reinstatement. They are 57 in number. The remaining casual workmen
74 in number shall be reinstated. In case of 57 casual workmen to whom reinstatement is refused,
the direction of the High Court is confirmed with the further addition that each one will be paid Rs.
1,000/- over and above the amount payable under the direction of the High Court and this would be
in lieu of reinstatement. Casual workmen 74 in number and having service of more than 9 months
on the date of dismissal will be treated as confirmed within six months of the date of their rejoining
and they will be offered reinstatement by March 31, 1980, and the High Court's direction for back
wages in their respect in confirmed.

With these modifications, we dismiss both the appeals. The Management-appellant will pay the
costs of the Sabha- respondent, advocates fee being fixed at Rs. 5,000/-. An Afterword This
litigation, involving many workmen living precariously on post-wages amidst agonising inflation
and a Management whose young budget, what with steel scarcity, may well be shaken by the burden
of arrears, points to the chronic pathology of our Justice System-the intractable and escalating
backlog in the Forensic Assembly Line that slowly spins Injustice out of Justice and effectually wears

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 57Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

down or keeps out the weaker sector of Indian life. This truma is felt more poignantly in Labour
litigation and the legislature fails functionally if it dawdles to radicalise, streamline and simplify the
conflict resolution procedures so as to be credibly available to the common people who make up the
lower bracket of the nation. The stakes are large, the peril is grave, the evils are worse than the
prognostics of Prof. Lawrence Tribe (of the Harvard Law School) :

"If court backlogs grow at their present rate, Our children may not be able to bring a
lawsuit to a conclusion within their lifetime. Legal claims might then be willed on,
generation to generation like hillbilly feuds; and the burdens of pressing them would
be contracted like a hereditary disease."

Law may be guilty of double injustice when it is too late and too costly for it holds out remedial
hopes which peter out into sour dupes and bleeds the anaemic litigant of his little cash only to
tantalise him into a system equal in form but unequal in fact. The price of this promise of unreality
may be the search by the lowly for the reality of revolutionary alternatives. Compelled by the crisis in
the Justice System, we sound this sombre judicial note.

We direct payments and reinstatements as spelt out earlier, within the specificated time, and,
hopefully, leave the case with the thought that, given better rapport between the partners in
production, the galvanic Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd., will forge ahead as a paradigm for the rest.

KOSHAL, J.-I have had the advantage of going through the judgment of my learned brother Iyer, J.,
but after giving the same my most serious consideration I regret that I find myself unable to endorse
it as I hold a different opinion in relation to three important findings arrived at by him, namely,

(a) that the discharge of workmen amounted really to their dismissal because the motivation for it
was their alleged misconduct.

(b) that an arbitrator would fall within the ambit of the term "Tribunal" as used in sub- section (2) of
section 11A of the Industrial Disputes Act (hereinafter called the 1947 Act), and

(c) that the High Court acted within the four corners or its jurisdiction under article 227 of the
Constitution of India while interfering with the finding of the arbitrator that the workmen were
correctly punished with dismissal if the orders of discharge could be construed as such.

Iam therefore appending this note which may be read in continuation of that judgment.

2. The parties are admittedly governed by the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders Act, 1946
(hereafter referred to as the "S.O. Act" section 15(2) of which empowers the appropriate
Government to make rules, inter alia setting out model standing orders for the purposes of that Act.
The expression 'standing orders' is defined in section 2(g) of the S.O. Act to mean rules relating to
the matters set out in the schedule thereto, items 8 and 9 of which run thus :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 58Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

"8. Termination of employment, and the notice therefor to be given by the employer
and workmen.

"g. Suspension or dismissal for misconduct and acts or omissions which constitute
misconduct."

The appropriate Government (in this case the Government of Gujarat) has prescribed Model
Standing Orders (M.S.Os. for short) under section 15(2) of the S.O. Act. The relevant part of M.S.O.
23 is extracted below :

"23. (1) Subject to the provisions of the Industrial disputes Act, 1947, the employment
of a permanent workman employed on rates other than the monthly rates of wages
may be terminated by giving him fourteen days' notice or by payment of thirteen
days' wages (including all admissible allowances) in lieu of notice.

"(D)cccccscccscesseeseceseeeteeeee "(BV eosvesesnvssvrwceesevesveueses "(4) The employment of a permanent
workman employed on the monthly rates of wages may be terminated by giving him
one month's notice or on payment of one month's wages (including all admissible
allowances) in lieu of notice.

"(4-A) The reasons for the termination of service of a permanent workman shall be
recorded in writing and communicated to him, if he so desires, at the time of
discharge, unless such communication, in the opinion of the Manager, is likely
directly or indirectly to lay any person open to civil or criminal proceedings at the
instance of the workman.

(5) esscccccesssseecceeeessteeeeeeseeee "(O).cccecsssecccessssteeeeeesesseeeeees "(7) All classes of workmen
other than those appointed on a permanent basis may leave their service or their
service may be terminated without or pay in lieu of notice : Provided that services of a
temporary workman shall not be terminated as a punishment unless he has been
given an opportunity of explaining the charges of misconduct alleged against him in
the manner prescribed in Standing Order 25.

M.S.O. 24 enumerates 25 kinds of acts or omissions on the part of a workman which amount to
misconduct. Clauses

(a) and (b) of the M.S.O. describe two of such acts thus :

"(a) willful insubordination or disobedience, whether or not in combination with
another, of any lawful and reasonable order of a superior;

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 59Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

(b) going on illegal strike or abetting, inciting, instigating or acting in furtherance
thereof;"

M.S.O. 25 lays down the manner in which a workman guilty of misconduct may be dealt with. It
states :

"25. (1) A workman guilty of misconduct may be 
 

(f) discharged under Order 23;
(g) dismissed without notice.

"(D).ccsccecccsceetecseceeeceeeeseeeeeseeeaeees "(3) No order of dismissal under sub-clause (g) of clause (1) shall be
made except after holding an inquiry against the workman concerned in respect of the alleged
misconduct in the manner set forth in clause (4).

"(4) A workman against whom an inquiry has been held shall be given a charge-sheet clearly setting
forth the circumstances appearing against him and requiring explanation. He shall be given an
opportunity to answer the charge and permitted to be defended by a workman working in the same
department as himself. Except for reasons to be recorded in writing by the officer holding the
inquiry, the workman shall be permitted to produce witnesses, in his defence and cross-examine any
witnesses on whose evidence the charge rests. A concise summary of the evidence led on either side
and the workman's plea shall be recorded. "(5) .....:sssscesssssesseceeeeeeeseeeeeaeeeeeeees -" Clauses (3) and (4) of
M.S.O. 25 speak of an inquiry only in the case of an order falling under sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of
that M.S. It is thus quite clear (and this is not disputed) that the only sub-clause of clause (1) of
M.S.O. 25 to which the provisions of clauses (3) and (4) of that M.S.O. would be attracted is
sub-clause (g) and that if an order of discharge falls under M.S.O. 23 an inquiry under clauses (3)
and (4) of M.S.O. 25 would not be a prerequisite thereto even though such an order is mentioned in
subclause (f) of clause (1) of that M.S.O. And that is why it has been vehemently urged on behalf of
the workmen who were discharged en masse and who were not taken back by the Management that
the orders of discharge made in relation to them amount really to orders of dismissal and are bad in
law by reason of the fact that no inquiry of the type above mentioned was held before they were
passed.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 60Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

3. Under M.S.Os. 23 and 25 the Management has the power to effect termination of the services of
an employee by having recourse to either of them. In action taken under M.S.O. 23 no element of
punishment is involved and the discharge is a discharge simpliciter; and that is why no opportunity
to the concerned employee to show cause against the termination is provided for. Dismissal,
however, which an employer may order, is, in its very nature, a punishment, the infiction of which
therefore has been made subject to the result of an inquiry (having the semblance of a trial in a
criminal proceeding). Exercise of each of the two powers has the effect of the termination of the
services of the concerned employee but must be regarded, because of the manner in which each has
been dealt with by the M.S.Os., as separate and distinct from the other.

4. It was vehemently argued on behalf of the workmen that once it was proved that the order of
discharge of a workman was passed by reason of a misconduct attributed to him by the
management, the order cannot but amount to an order of dismissal. But this argument, to my mind,
is wholly without substance, and that for two reasons. For one thing, clause (1) of M.S.O. 25
specifically states in sub-clause

(f) that a workman guilty of misconduct may be discharged under M.S.O. 23. This clearly means that
when the employer is satisfied that a workman has been guilty of misconduct, he may (apart from
visiting the workman with any of the punishments specified in sub-clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and

(e) of clause (1) of M.S.O. 25) either pass against him an order of discharge for which no inquiry
precedent as provided for in clauses (3) and (4) of M.S.O. 25 would be necessary, or, may dismiss
him after holding such an inquiry. Which of the two kinds of order the employer shall pass is left
entirely to his own discretion.

It is true that the employer cannot pass a real order of dismissal in the garb of one of discharge. But
that only means that if the order of termination of services of an employee is in reality intended to
punish an employee and not merely to get rid of him because he is considered useless, inconvenient
or troublesome, the order, even though specified to be an order of discharge, would be deemed to be
an order of dismissal covered by sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of M.S.O. 25. On the other hand if no
such intention is made out, the order would remain one of discharge simpliciter even though it has
been passed for the sole reason that a misconduct is imputed to the employee. That is how, in my
opinion, M.S.Os. 23 and 25 have to be interpreted. The argument that once an alleged misconduct is
shown to have been the motive for the passage of an order of discharge, the same would
immediately and without more, amount to an order of dismissal, is not warranted by the language
used in M.S.O. 25 which specifically gives to the employer the power to get rid of "a workman guilty
of misconduct" by passing an order of his discharge under M.S.O. 23.

5. Secondly, the reasons for the termination of service of a permanent workman under M.S.O. 23
have to be recorded in writing and communicated to him, if he so desires, under clause 4-A) thereof.
Such reasons must obviously consist of an opinion derogatory to the workman in relation to the
performance of his duties; and whether such reasons consist of negligence, work-shirking or of
serious overt acts like theft or embezzlement, they would in any case amount to misconduct for
which he may be punished under M.S.O. 25. It is difficult to conceive of a case in which such reasons

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 61Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

would not amount to misconduct. The result is that M.S.O. 23 would be rendered otiose if
termination of service thereunder for misconduct could be regarded as a dismissal and such a result
strikes at the very root of accepted canons of interpretation. If it was open to the Court to "lift the
veil" and to hold an order of discharge to amount to a dismissal merely because the motive behind it
was a misconduct attributed to the employee, the services of no employee could be terminated
without holding against him an inquiry such as is contemplated by clauses (3) and (4) of M.S.O. 25.

6. The interpretation placed by me on M.S.Os. 23 and 25 finds ample support in Bombay
Corporation v. Malvankar(1) of which the facts are on all fours with those in the present case. Miss
P. S. Malvankar, respondent No. 1 in that case, was a clerk in the employment or the Bombay
Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking which was being run by the Bombay Corporation. Her
services were terminated on the ground that her record of service was unsatisfactory. It was however
stated in the order of termination of her services that she would be paid one month's wages in lieu of
notice and would also be eligible for all the benefits as might be admissible under the Standing
Orders and Service Regulations of the Undertaking. Those Standing Orders correspond to the
standing orders with which we are here concerned. Thereunder, two powers were conferred on the
employer, one being a power to impose punishment for misconduct following a disciplinary inquiry
under clause (2) of Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 23 and the other one to terminate
the service of the employee by one calendar month's written notice or pay in lieu thereof under
Standing Order 26. The question arose as to which power had been exercised by the employer in the
case of Miss Malvankar and Jaswant Singh, J., delivering the judgment of the Court on behalf of
himself and Bhagwati, J., was answering that question when he made the observations reproduced
from his decision by my learned brother Iyer, J. This Court was then clearly of the opinion that
(a) the power to terminate the services by an order of discharge simpliciter is distinct
from and independent of the power to punish for misconduct and the Standing
Orders cannot be construed so as to render either of these powers ineffective; and

(b) reasons for termination have to be communicated to the employee and those
reasons cannot be arbitrary, capricious or irrelevant but that would not mean that the
order of termination becomes punitive in character just because good reasons are its
basis.

The Court further remarked that if the misconduct of the employee constituted the foundation for
terminating his service then it might be liable to be regarded as punitive but this proposition was
doubted inasmuch as "even in such case it may be argued that the management has not punished
the employee but has merely terminated his service under Standing Order 26".

7. So all that remains to be determined in this connection is as to when would misconduct be the
‘foundation' of an order of dis
charge. Merely because it is the reason which weighed with the employer in effecting the
termination of services would not make the order of such termination as one founded on

misconduct, for, such a proposition would run counter to the plain meaning of clause (1) of M.S.O.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 62Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

25. For an order to be ‘founded’ on misconduct, it must, in my opinion, be intended to have been
passed by way of punishment, that is, it must be intended to chastise or cause pain in body or mind
or harm or loss in reputation or money to the concerned worker. If such an intention cannot be
spelled out of the prevailing circumstances, the order of discharge or the reasons for which it was
ostensibly passed, it cannot be regarded as an order of dismissal. Such would be the case when the
employer orders discharge in the interests of the factory or of the general body of workers
themselves. That this is what was really meant by the judicial precedents which use the word
‘foundation’ in connection with the present controversy finds support from a number of decisions of
this Court. In The Chartered Bank, Bombay v. The Chartered Bank, Employees' Union(1) this Court
held that if the termination of service is a colourable exercise of the power vested in the
management or is a result of victimization or unfair labour practice, the Industrial Tribunal will
have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination. Applying this principle to the facts of
the case before it, this Court ruled :

"We are satisfied that the management has passed the order of termination
simpliciter and the order does not amount to one of dismissal as and by way of
punishment" (emphasis supplied).

This case was followed in The Tata Oil Mills Co., Ltd., v. Workmen(2) where Gajendragadkar, C.J.,
who delivered the judgment of the Court, stated the law thus :

"The true legal position about the Industrial Courts' jurisdiction and authority in
dealing with cases of this kind is no longer in doubt. It is true that in several cases,
contract of employment or provisions in Standing Orders authorise an industrial
employer to terminate the service of his employees after giving notice for one month
on paying salary for one month in lieu of notice, and normally, an employer may, in a
proper case, be entitled to exercise the said power. But where an order of discharge
passed by an employer gives rise to an industrial dispute, the form of the order by
which the employees' services are terminated, would not be decisive; industrial
adjudication would be entitled to examine the substance of the matter and decide
whether the termination is in fact discharge simpliciter or it amounts to dismissal
which has put on the cloak of a discharge simpliciter. If the Industrial Court is
satisfied that the order of discharge is punitive, that it is mala fide, or that it amounts
to victimization or unfair labour practice, it is competent to the Industrial Court to
set aside the order and in a proper case, direct the reinstatement of the employee. In
some cases, the termination of the employee's services may appear to the Industrial
Court to be capricious or so unreasonably severe that an inference may legitimately
and reasonably be drawn that in terminating the services, the employer was not
acting bona fide. The test always has to be whether the act of the employer is
bonafide or not. If the act is mala fide, or appears to be a colourable exercise of the
powers conferred on the employer either by the terms of the contract or by the
standing orders, then notwithstanding the form of the order, industrial adjudication
would examine the substance and would direct reinstatement in a fit case..".

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 63Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

The same test was laid down for determining whether an order of discharge could be construed as
one ordering dismissal in The Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co., Ltd., v. S. C. Prasad(1) by
Shelat and Bhargava, JJ. :

"No doubt, the fact that the order was couched in the language of discharge
simpliciter is not conclusive. Where such an order gives rise to an industrial dispute
its form is not decisive and the tribunal which adjudicates that dispute can, of course,
examine the substance of the matter and decide whether the termination is in fact
discharge simpliciter or dismissal though the language of the order is one of simple
termination of service. If it is satisfied that the order is punitive or mala fide or is
made to victimise the workmen or amounts to unfair labour practice, it is competent
to set it aside. The test is whether the act of the employer is bona fide. If it is not, and
is a colourable exercise of the power under the contract of service or standing orders,
the Tribunal can discard it and in a proper case direct reinstatement."

The Chartered Bank, Bombay v. The Chartered Bank Employees' Union (supra) was followed by this
Court in Workmen of Sudder Office, Cinnamore v. Management(1) and therein stress was laid on
the employer's right to terminate the services of a workman by an order of discharge simpliciter
under the terms of the contract where there was no lack of bona fides, unfair labour practice or
victimization.

So the real criterion which formed the touchstone of a test to determine whether an order of
termination of services is an order of discharge simpliciter or amounts to dismissal is the real nature
of the order, that is, the intention with which it was passed. If the intention was to punish, that is, to
chastise, the order may be regarded as an order of dismissal; and for judging the intention, the
question of mala fides (which is the same thing as a colourable exercise of power) becomes
all-important. If no mala fides can be attributed to the management, the order of discharge must be
regarded as one having been caused under M.S.O. 23 even though the reason for its passage is
serious misconduct.

8. It is in light of the conclusion just above arrived at that the discharge of the workmen in the
instant case has to be judged. The question of intention or mala fides is really one of fact (of which
the arbitrator was, in my opinion, the sole judge, unless his finding on the point was vitiated by
perversity in which case alone it was liable to be reviewed by the High Court). The discussion of the
evidence by the arbitrator in his award is not only full and logical but, in my opinion, also eminently
just. At all material times the Management was out to placate the Sabha (and therefore, the
workmen) and gave to it a long rope throughout. The attitude of the Sabha on the other hand was
one of intransigence and obduracy. According to the settlement of the 4th of August, 1972, it was not
open to the workmen to resort to a strike till the expiry of a period of five years; nor could the
Management declare a lock out till then. Any disputes arising between the parties, according to the
terms arrived at, were to be sorted out through negotiations or, failing that, by recourse to
arbitration. A dispute was raised by the Sabha soon thereafter over the implementation of the
recommendations of the Central Engineering Wage Board (hereinafter called the Board), the
payment of bonus for the year 1971 and wages for an earlier lock out. In paragraph 7.47 of its award

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 64Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

the Board had made the following recommendations :

"7.47. After considering the problem in its entirety, we agreed to divide the industry
into five regions or areas as under and in doing so, we have also considered the
prevailing wage levels at different places and the cost of living at important centres in
these places.

"1. Bombay City and Greater Bombay including Thana Ambarnath & Kalyan
Industrial Areas.

"2. Calcutta, Greater Calcutta, Howrah Industrial area, Jamshedpur Industrial area,
Durgapur, Asansol and Ranchi industrial areas.

"3. Madras industrial area, Bangalore industrial area, Hyderabad industrial area,
Poona-Chinchwad industrial area, Delhi industrial area and Ahmedabad.

"4. Coimbatore, Nagpur, Bhopal, Kanpur, Baroda and Faridabad industrial areas.
"5. The rest of the country."

This classification was made for the purpose of granting ‘area allowance’ which varied with the
category in which the area of the situation of a factory fell. No allowance was to be paid to the
factories falling in category 5 and on the basis of the phraseology used by the Board the
Management contended that Ahmedabad industrial area (in which its factory was situated) fell
within that category. This interpretation of the categorisation made by the Board was not acceptable
to the Sabha who claimed that the factory was covered by category 3; and this was an issue on which
the Sabha was not prepared to climb down. Similarly, the Sabha was adamant on the question of
bonus for the year 1971 which it claimed at 16 per cent over and above 8.33 per cent allowed by
statute with the plea that bonus at that rate had been paid in the earlier year. This being the position
and negotiations between the parties held at two meetings convened on 14-12-1972 and 20-1-1973
having ended in a fiasco, the Management offered to have the disputes resolved by arbitration but
that again was a course not acceptable to the Sabha which, however, accused the Management of
flouting the settlement dated the 4th of August , 1972, by not coming to the negotiating table. The
attitude adopted by the Sabha was, to say the least, most unreason able. It could not have its own
way in taking certain matters as final and non-negotiable. Nor can it be said that stand taken by the
management was unreasonable. Paragraph 7.47 of the award of the Board categorized various
factories with reference to the areas which were either described by the names of the cities in which
they were situated or by the names of certain industrial areas. Anmedabad was mentioned as such
and so was Calcutta while the other areas were mentioned as such and such industrial areas. It was
thus a very reasonable plea put forward on behalf of the Management that only Ahmedabad city and
not Ahmedabad industrial area was included in category 3 and that that industrial area fell within
category 5. On the other hand, the Sabha interpreted the word ‘Ahmedabad' occurring in category 3
to include Ahmedabad industrial area (in which lay the factory in question) and demanded area
allowance for its workers on that score. The reasonableness of the plea of the Management is

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 65Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

obvious and it was the attitude of the Sabha which lacked reason in that on the failure of the
negotiations they spurned the offer of the Management for arbitration on the question of
interpretation of the categorisation. It can also not be said that the objection regarding payment of
bonus raised by the Management was not a reasonable one. The argument that the stand of the
Management that the negotiations between them and the Sabha on the questions of interpretation
of the Board's award and bonus having failed as there was no meeting ground on either of them,
they could be referred to arbitration, lacked reason, is wholly unacceptable. The attitude of the
Sabha in insisting on negotiations being held only on the basis of certain propositions formulated by
it amounted really to a refusal to negotiate the points in dispute and the Management was therefore
not left with any alternative except to suggest an arbitration as envisaged in the settlement dated the
4th of August, 1972.

9. Later developments reveal a similar state of affairs in so far as the attitude of the Sabha is
concerned. Over and over again it was asked not to precipitate a strike and to act within the terms of
the settlement but the advice fell on deaf ears. Even after the strike which, it is admitted on all
hands, was illegal and certainly not envisaged by the settlement of the 4th of August, 1972, the
Management continued to make requests to the Sabha to send back the workers, but again no heed
was paid to those requests. On the other hand, the Sabha began making suggestions to the
Government to take over the factory. Ultimately, when the Management was faced, to adopt means
to rehabilitate the factory by reports to fresh recruitment, they had no option except to terminate the
services of its workmen. Each one of the orders of termination of services which were actually
passed, was on the face of it wholly innocuous inasmuch as it did not stigmatise in any manner
whatsoever the concerned workman. The Management had however to record reasons for the
discharge in pursuance of the provisions of clause (4A) of M.S.O. 25 and those reasons did charge
each worker with misconduct inasmuch as he had taken part in the illegal strike and had refused to
resume duty inspite of repeated demands made by the Management in that behalf. All the same, the
Management made it clear that inspite of such misconduct it had no intention of punishing the
workers who were given not only the benefit of an order of discharge simpliciter but also the option
to come back to work within a specified period in which case they would be reinstated with full
benefits. An intention not to punish could not be expressed in clearer terms and is further made out
from the fact that more than 400 workers who resumed duty were reinstated without break in
service. In passing the orders of discharge, therefore, the Management did nothing more than act
under M.S.O. 23 and its action cannot be regarded as amounting to dismissal in the case of any of
the workers. They had the right to choose between a discharge simpliciter and a dismissal and, in
the interests of the factory and the members of the Sabha and perhaps on compassionate grounds
also, they chose the former in unequivocal terms. The intention to punish being absent, the finding
of the High Court that the order of discharge amounted to one of dismissal cannot be sustained.

10. I now turn to the interpretation of sub-section (2) of section 11A of the 1947 Act. It is a well
settled canon of interpretation of statutes that the language used by the legislature must be regarded
as the only source of its intention unless such language is ambiguous, in which situation the
preamble to the Act the Statement of Objects of and Reasons for bringing it on the Statute book and
the purpose underlying the legislation may be taken into consideration for ascertaining such
intention. That the purpose of the legislation is to fulfil a socio-economic need, or the express object

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 66Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

underlying it, does not come into the picture till an ambiguity is detected in the language and the
court must steer clear of the temptation to mould the written word according to its own concept of
what should have been enacted. That is how I propose to approach the exercise in hand.

11. For the sake of convenience of reference I may set out the provisions of clauses (aa) and (r) of
section 2, of sub-sections (1) and (2) and the opening clause of sub-section (3) of section 11, and of
the whole of section 11A of the 1947 Act:

"2, (aa) ‘arbitrator' includes an umpire;" "2. (r) ‘Tribunal’ means an Industrial
Tribunal constituted under section 7A and includes an Industrial Tribunal
constituted before the 10th of March, 1957, under this Act;"

"11. (1) Subject to any rules that may be made in this behalf, an arbitrator, a Board,
Court, Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal shall follow such procedure as
the arbitrator or other authority concerned may think fit.

"(2) A conciliation officer or a member of a Board, or Court or the presiding officer of
a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal may for the purpose of inquiry into
any existing or apprehended industrial dispute, after giving reasonable notice, enter
the premises occupied by any establishment to which the dispute relates.

"(3) Every Board, Court, Labour Court, Tribunal and National Tribunal shall have the
same powers as are vested in a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
when trying a suit, in respect of the following matters, namely:- .......... "

"11A. Where an industrial dispute, relating to the discharge or dismissal of a
workman has been referred to a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal for
adjudication and, in the course of the adjudication proceedings, the Labour Court,
Tribunal or National Tribunal, as the case may be, is satisfied that the order of
discharge or dismissal was not justified, it may, by its award, set aside the order of
discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms and
conditions, if any, as it thinks fit, or give such other relief to the workman including
the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of discharge or dismissal as the
circumstances of the case may require:

Provided that in any proceeding under this section the Labour Court, Tribunal or
National Tribunal, as the case may be, shall rely only on the materials on record and
shall not take any fresh evidence in relation to the matter."

Section 2 of the Act specifically lays down that unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or
context, the expressions defined therein would have the meanings attributed to them. Throughout
the Act therefore, while 'arbitrator' would include an umpire, a 'Tribunal' would not include an
arbitrator but would mean only an Industrial Tribunal constituted under the Act, unless the context
makes it necessary to give the word a different connotation. In sub- section (1) of section 11, it is

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 67Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

conceded, the word 'Tribunal' has been used in accordance with the definition appearing in clause
(r) of section 2 because an arbitrator is separately mentioned in that sub-section. In sub-sections (2)
and (3) of that section a Board, a Labour Court, a Tribunal and a National Tribunal have been
invested with certain powers. Would a Tribunal as contemplated by sub- sections (2) and (3) then
include an arbitrator ? My reply to the question is all emphatic 'no’. It is well settled that if a term or
expression is used in a particular piece of legislation in one sense at one place, the same sense will
pervade the entire legislation wherever the term is used unless an intention to the contrary is
expressed. Here the word "Tribunal' has been used in three sub-sections of the same section and no
reason at all is fathomable for the proposition that it means one thing in sub-section (1) and
something different in sub-sections (2) and (3). It may also be mentioned here that in all the three
sub-sections the word 'Tribunal' has a capital 'T' which is also part of the expression 'Tribunal' as
occurring in clause (r) of section 2 and thus connotes a proper noun rather than the generic word
‘tribunal’ as embracing all institutions adjudicating upon rights of contending parties. A third and
perhaps a clinching reason for this interpretation is available in the use of the expression "National
Tribunal" along with the word "Tribunal" in all the three sub-sections which militates against the
argument that the word "Tribunal" as used in sub-sections (2) and (3) means an institution of that
type. If the word "Tribunal" as used in sub-sections (2) and (3) means such an institution, then the
use of the expression "National Tribunal" would be redundant and redundancy is not one of the
qualities easily attributable to a legislative product. In that case, in fact, other words used in the two
sub-sections last mentioned, namely, 'Court' and 'Labour Court’ would also become redundant. In
this view of the matter, the word "Tribunal" as used in all the first three sub-sections of section 11
must be held to have been used in the sense of the definition occurring in clause (r) of section 2.

12. Section 11A is just the next succeeding section and therein a part of the arrangement adopted is
the same as in sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 11 so that powers are conferred by it on a "Labour
16-868SCI/79 Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal" which arrangement is repeated in the section
thrice over. That the word "Tribunal" as used in section 11A has the same meaning as it carries in the
three sub-sections of section 11 is obvious and I need not repeat the reasons in that behalf; for, they
are practically the same as have been set out by me in relation to section 11.

13. In my opinion the language employed in section 11A sufferers from no ambiguity whatever and is
capable only of one meaning, i.e., that the word 'Tribunal' occurring therein is used in the sense of
the definition given in clause (r) of section 2. It is thus not permissible for this Court to take the
Statement of Objects and Reasons or the purpose underlying the enactment into consideration while
interpreting section 11A.

I may mention here however that a perusal of the Statement of Objects and Reasons forming the
background to the enactment of section 11A leads me to the same conclusion. In that Statement a
reference was specifically made to tribunals as well as arbitrators in, terms of the recommendations
of the International Labour Organization. But inspite of that the word ‘arbitrator' is conspicuous by
its absence from the section. What is the reason for the omission ? Was it consciously and
deliberately made or was it due to carelessness on the part of the draftsmen and a consequent failure
on the part of the legislature ? In my opinion the Court would step beyond the field of interpretation
and enter upon the area of legislation if it resorts to guess work (however intelligently the same may

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/609478/ 68Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd vs Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha on 19 November, 1979

be carried out) and attributes the omission to the latter cause in a situation like this which
postulates that the pointed attention of the legislature was drawn to the desirability of clothing an
arbitrator with the same powers as were sought to be conferred on certain courts and tribunals by
section 11A and it did not accept the recommendation. I would hold, in the circumstances, that the
omission was deliberately made.

It follows that the powers given to a Tribunal under section 11A are not exercisable by an arbitrator
who, therefore, cannot interfere with the punishment (awarded by the employer) in case he finds
misconduct proved.

14. The last point on which I differ with the finding of my learned brother relates to the exercise by
the High Court of its powers under article 227 of the Constitution of India. As pointed out by him
the High Court, while discharging its functions as envisaged by that article, does not sit as a court of
appeal over the award of the arbitrator but exercises limited jurisdiction which extends only to
seeing that the arbitrator has functioned within the scope of his legal authority. This proposition
finds full support from Nagendra Nath Bora and Another v. The Commissioner of Hills Division and
Appeals, Assam and Others(1), P. H. Kalyani v. M/s. Air France, Calcutta(2), state of Andhra
Pradesh v. S. Sree Rama Rao(3) and Navinchandra Shakerchand Shah v. Manager, Anmedabad
Cooperative Department Stores Ltd.(4), all of which have ben discussed at length by him and
require no further consideration at my hands. In this view of the matter it was not open to the High
Court to revise the punishment (if the discharge is regarded as such) meted out by the Management
to the delinquent workmen and left in tact by the arbitrator whose authority in doing so has not
been shown to have been exercised beyond the limits of his jurisdiction.

15. I need not go into the other aspects of the case. In view of my findings
(a) that the orders of discharge of the workmen could not be regarded as orders of
their dismissal and were, on the other hand, orders of discharge simpliciter properly
passed under M.S.O. 23;

(b) that the arbitrator could not exercise the powers conferred on a Tribunal under section 11A of the
1947 Act and could not therefore interfere with the punishment awarded by the Management to the
workmen (even if the discharge could be regarded a punishment), and

(c) that in any case the High Court exceeded the limits of its jurisdiction in interfering with the said
punishment purporting to act in the exercise of its powers under article 227 of the Constitution of
India, the judgment of the High Court must be reversed and the order of the arbitrator restored. The
three appeals are decided accordingly, the parties being left to bear their own costs throughout.

ORDER The appeals are dismissed substantially with such modifications as are indicated in the
decretal part of the judgment of the majority.

V.D.K. Appeals dismissed.

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 24/08/2006

BENCH:
S.B. Sinha & P.P. Naolekar

JUDGMENT :
JUDGMENT With CIVIL APPEAL NO.3802 of 1999 S.B. SINHA, J:
Background facts:

Kanpur is a metropolitan town. The respondents herein were owners of a house property bearing
municipal number 7/169, on a freehold plot bearing No.22, measuring 2978 sq. yards, situate in
Block B, Scheme No.7, Gutaiyya, Swaroop Nagar in the said town (‘the property’ for short). The ist
respondent-Pushpa Devi Saraf and the 2nd respondent-Mohan Lal Saraf intended to promote a
company in the name of the 5th respondent-M/s. Kanpur Exports (P) Ltd. (‘the Company’ for short).
They filed an application therefor as promoters of the Company on 15.2.1979. They acquired the
property in their capacity of promoters or Directors of the proposed company from one Shanti
Narain Verma by a registered Deed of Sale dated 24.2.1979 at a price of Rs.2 lakhs. The said Deed of
Sale contained a clause of re-conveyance of 'the property’.

The Company was incorporated on 19.6.1979. The amount of consideration paid to said Shanti
Narain Verma was repaid by the Company by two cheques of Rs.1,11,250/- each to Mohan Lal Saraf
and Pushpa Devi Saraf (hereinafter referred to as "Sarafs"). The first balance sheet of the Company
was signed by the 2nd respondent herein on 30.6.1980, wherein also 'the property’ was shown to be
that of the company. With a view to do away with the said clause of re-conveyance, a suit was filed
by the Company against the said Shanti Narain Verma. The said suit was decreed. The First
Directors’ Report dated 15.11.1980 and the balance sheet of the Company for the year ending
30.6.1981, signed by the 2nd respondent herein also disclosed the property to be that of the
Company. Directors of the Company, viz., 'Sarafs' resolved to sell the property in favour of the
appellants herein. A resolution to let out the property in favour of one Manoj Kumar Poddar was
also adopted by it. A General Power of Attorney was also executed by the Company in favour of one
M.M. Aggarwal who had specially been invited to attend the said meeting. Pursuant to or in
furtherance of the said resolution, an agreement of sale of the said property was executed by Sarafs

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 1Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

as Directors of the Company, wherefor the total consideration was fixed at Rs.11 lakhs. Out of the
said amount, a sum of Rs.10 lakhs was paid in advance through Bankers' Cheques and Cash Orders
dated 11.6.1984 and 12.6.1984. The remaining amount of Rupees One lakh was to be paid at the time
of execution and registration of the Deed of Sale.

A registered Deed of Lease pursuant to the said resolution was also executed and registered in
favour of said Shri M.K. Poddar, the sister's son of the appellant, on the same day. There exists a
dispute, to which we would advert to at an appropriate stage, as to whether the possession of the
property had been handed over to Shri M.K. Poddar or not.

Proceeding :

The appellants herein issued a notice asking the respondents to execute a Deed of Sale on 5.8.1984.
They also got a public notice published in Newspaper notifying the execution of the agreement for
sale between the appellants and the contesting respondents. Another Agreement for sale was
purported to have been executed on 4.6.1984 by 'Sarafs' in favour of one Surendra Kumar Mittal
stated to be a close relation (brother-in-law) of Mohan Kumar Saraf.

The appellants filed a suit against the respondents for injunction. Subsequently, a relief by way of
decree of specific performance of the agreement for sale was also prayed for. A further prayer was
made therein that the purported Agreement of Sale dated 4.6.1984 executed by the defendant Nos.2
to 4 in favour of the said Surendra Kumar Mittal was a sham.

The said M.K. Poddar also instituted a suit for injunction on 25.5.1984, which was numbered as Suit
No.612 of 1984, wherein an interim order of injunction, directing the parties not to interfere with his
possession was passed. In the said suit, an Advocate Commissioner was also appointed. He found
the said M.K. Poddar to be in possession of the property.

A purported dispute, however, was raised as regards ownership of the said property by and between
the Company on the one hand and the Sarafs on the other. One Shri B.S. Mathur, Advocate was
appointed as sole Arbitrator. He made an Award holding the property to be belonging to Sarafs.
They were directed to refund an amount of Rs.2,22,500/- to the Company; they having received the
same from the Company. The Award was made Rule of the Court. An Execution Case was filed to
execute the decree. In execution of the said decree a warrant of delivery of Possession was issued
against the Company and M.K. Poddar was said to have been dispossessed.

M.K. Poddar, indisputably filed an application under Order 21 Rule 99 of the Civil Procedure Code
for restoration of possession of the said property. In response to the notice issued thereupon, the
respondents contended that they intended to raise a multi-storied building upon demolition of the

existing building.

Suits and other proceedings initiated by the appellants :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 2Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

A suit was filed by the appellants and the said M.K. Poddar in the Delhi High Court for a declaration
that the Decree dated 21.2.1985 passed by the said Court was obtained by fraud and thus was a
nullity. Another suit was filed by the appellants for declaration and appointment of Receiver before
the Civil Judge, Kanpur Dehat being Suit No.237 of 1989, wherein a declaration was sought for that
the defendants therein, in view of the Agreement of Sale dated 12.6.1984, had no authority to cause
any damage to the suit property. Symbolic possession was directed to be given in favour of the
appellants therein by an order dated 23.10.1989. However, the said suit later on was withdrawn.
Another suit was filed by the appellants in the Court of Munsif, Kanpur praying for an order
restraining Sarafs from interfering with their right to manage and maintain the suit property, which
was registered as Original Suit No.2256 of 1989. The said suit was also dismissed as withdrawn by
an order dated 26.8.1991. The appellants also filed a suit for permanent injunction, which was
registered as Suit No.677/91 for restraining the respondents from causing any disturbance in their
peaceful possession. The said suit was also dismissed. It is furthermore not in dispute that one G.P.
Tiwari claiming himself to be the caretaker of the property filed a suit against the respondents and
by an order dated 13.7.1987 an ex-parte decree was passed in terms of the provisions of the U.P.
Rent Control Act. An application for setting aside the said ex-parte decree was filed by Mohan Lal
Saraf. The first respondent herein also filed a writ petition for quashing the said ex-parte decree
before the Allahabad High Court, which was numbered as Writ Petition No.21985 of 1989. The said
ex-parte decree was set aside by an order dated 8.2.1990. The said suit was also withdrawn by G.P.
Tiwari. The writ petition filed by respondent No.1 herein was also dismissed as having become
infructuous, whereagainst Pushpa Devi Saraf preferred a Special Leave Petition which was also
dismissed by an order dated 19.9.1990. However, the said order dated 19.9.1990 was recalled by this
Court by an order dated and the petition was disposed of on 14.8.1991, directing the District Judge,
Kanpur to nominate a Receiver for taking charge of the property.

Suit and other proceedings initiated by the respondents :

On 8.7.1980, the Company through its Directors, Sarafs, filed a suit against Shanti Narain Verma for
declaration that the Company was the absolute owner in possession of the suit premises. However,
as noticed hereinbefore, before the Trial Court, the respondents, inter alia, raised a contention that
the Sarafs were the owners of the suit property and not the Company. The learned trial Court
negatived the said contention. As noticed hereinbefore, the said suit questioning the grant of
symbolic possession was decreed in favour of the appellants. A writ petition was filed on 9.5.1990
which was numbered as Writ Petition No.24301/89. The order granting symbolic possession was
quashed by the High Court by an order dated 23.10.1989 on the premise that there had been no
sufficient service and the matter was remanded to the Trial Court for fresh consideration thereof. A
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.23804/89 was filed in the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad
for a direction that a criminal case be registered for protection of life and property of the Sarafs and
for payment of damages for damages allegedly caused to them. By an order dated 9.12.1993, the
High Court directed investigation into the allegations made by Sarafs by the Central Bureau of
Investigation. Upon completion of the investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation, a
charge-sheet was filed against the appellants and the trial against them is pending.

Judgment of the Court :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 3Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

On the backdrop of several litigations between the parties and allegations and counter allegations
made by one party against the other therein, the learned Trial Court decreed the Appellants’ suit for
specific performance of contract. The said judgment and decree came to be challenged before the
High Court. A Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal on the premise that the Trial
Court had wrongly exercised its discretionary jurisdiction under Section 20 of the Specific Relief
Act, 1963; as the appellants were guilty of demolition of the existing structures on the land. The
learned Judges of the Division Bench of the High Court, however, differed in their opinion on other
issues.

Both the parties are, thus, before us.
Submissions :

Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants raised the
following contentions:

i) The High Court committed a serious error in holding that the Sarafs had purchased the property
for the benefit of the Company ignoring the decree passed in favour of the Company as also the
representations made by the Sarafs to the State Bank of India, before the Courts of Law as also the
society at large.

(ii) Sarafs were estopped and precluded from denying the title of the Company and setting up their
own title over the property in view of their representations made to the appellants and the world at
large.

iii) Even if Sarafs were owners of the property, the Agreement of Sale executed in favour of the
appellants was valid as the Company itself was being represented by them who were even otherwise
authorized to execute the Agreement on behalf of the company and, thus, by reason of their conduct,
they must be held to have executed the said Agreement on their own behalf also.

iv) The Court failed to apply the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil, as the same was necessary for
determining the real issue between the parties.

(v) Assuming that the Award passed by the Arbitrator, as also the decree passed by the High Court
pursuant thereto are valid in law, in terms whereof Sarafs were declared to be owners of the
property, the agreement of sale would be binding on them.

vi) The Award and the decree, having been obtained by practicing fraud as envisaged under Section
44 of the Evidence Act, were void ab initio and the Trial Court rightly having applied the said
principle, the same could not have been overturned by one of the Judges of the Division Bench of
the High Court.

vii) Withdrawal of Suit No. 1252/85 filed by the appellants for setting aside the Award and the
consequent decree, would not debar the appellants from raising the said issue as a plea of fraud can

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 4Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

be raised at any stage and even in a collateral proceeding.

viii) The Award and the decree of the Delhi High Court, in any view of the matter, would not
adversely affect the interest of the appellants, which could not have been relied upon by the
respondents as they were not parties thereto.

ix) Both the Hon'ble Judges of the High Court committed a manifest error in arriving at a finding
that the appellants were responsible for demolition of the existing structures and institution of the
rent case through G.P. Tiwari.

(x) Even assuming that the said findings are correct, the same by itself could not have been a ground
for denying the appellants the relief by way of a decree for specific performance of contract.

Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other
hand, would support the impugned judgment contending :

(i) The High Court has rightly arrived at a finding that the suit property was demolished on
23.9.1989 illegally by the appellant No.1 and his associates and thus, they became disentitled from
obtaining the discretionary relief of specific performance of contract;

(ii) The said finding of the High Court being based upon the materials on record including the
judgment of another Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court passed in Criminal Writ Petition
No.23804/89, as also the charge-sheet issued by the Central Bureau of Investigation upon
investigation made pursuant to the order of the High Court and various other orders passed by this
Court, the impugned judgment should not be interfered with.

(iii) The High Court rightly came to the conclusion that Shri G.P. Tiwari was set up by the appellants
which would be evident from the fact that they had a common counsel and, had furthermore
approached this Court as appellants against the orders passed by the High Court.

(iv) Shri G.P. Tiwari himself having admitted that he had handed over possession of the suit
premises to one of the brothers of the appellant, collusion between himself and the appellants stood
established.

(v) The appellants had abused the process of court, as they not only got the aforementioned Rent
Case No. 99/87 instituted by Shri G.P. Tiwari, but also initiated multiple proceedings against Sarafs
with a view to obtain ex-parte orders through one Nand Lal Jaiswal, Advocate and in that view of the
matter they were not entitled to any discretionary relief in terms of Section 20 of the Specific Relief
Act, 1963.

(vi) The purported Agreement of Sale dated 12.6.84 was in effect and substance an agreement of
loan.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 5Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

(vii) The agreement dated 12.6.84 itself having stipulated that in the event of defect in the right or
title of the parties of the first part or the said Company, or any other encumbrance or legal hurdle in
respect of the suit property, the appellants would have an option to refund the advance money of
Rs.10 lakhs together with interest @18% per annum, no relief by way of specific performance of
contract could have been granted.

In view of the following surrounding and attending circumstances, the purported agreement to sell
should be construed to be an Agreement for Loan:

(a) Sudhir Kumar Parasrampuria, while examining himself as P.W.1 in his deposition, categorically
stated that he had been informed by respondent No.2 that the property belonged to the Company as
also individuals which would demonstrate that he was aware of the ownership of Sarafs thereover;

(b) The said property having not been mentioned in the Articles of Association of the Company, it
could not have been treated to be the owner thereof in law;

(c) Shanti Narain Verma having sold the property in favour of Sarafs by a deed of sale dated
24.2.1979 and the Company having admittedly been incorporated on 19.6.1979, the title in respect
thereof did not vest in the Company and, thus, the provisions of Section 15(h) and 19(e) of the
Specific Relief Act, 1963 would have no application in the instant case. As on the date of execution of
sale, the Company had no funds of its own and the amount of consideration, admittedly, having
been paid by Sarafs, the Company could not be declared to be the owner thereof by a Court of law as
was purportedly done by reason of the judgment dated 19.8.1987 in the suit filed by the Company
against Shanti Narain Verma.

(d) The controversy in Suit No.267/80 being confined to the applicability of the re-conveyance
clause contained in the deed of sale dated 24.2.1979, the question of ownership of the property
having been vested in the Company did not and could not arise and in that view of the matter, the
judgment rendered therein was inadmissible in evidence to prove the Company's title thereover.

Ownership issue :

The property in question was purchased by the Promoters of the company, namely, Sarafs. An
application for registration of the company was filed on 15.2.1979 under the Companies Act, 1956
and the company was registered on 19.6.1979. Sarafs at the relevant were the only Directors and
shareholders of the Company. In the deed of sale, they described themselves as Promoters/Directors
of the company. As on the date of execution of the deed of sale, the company being not registered,
the property was purchased in the name of the Promoters. In the balance sheet, income tax return,
annual report, audit accounts and other relevant documents, the company had been shown to be the
owner of the property. On its registration, the company also paid a sum of Rs.2,22,500/- to Sarafs.
The company in its report dated 15.11.1980 categorically mentioned that it had acquired fixed assets
of Rs.3,03,924/- including free hold land valued at Rs.1,02,500/- . The balance sheet also
mentioned that the disputed property was the assets of the company. The company had taken a loan
from the State Bank of India, Kanpur Branch upon mortgaging the property as a security.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 6Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

We have noticed hereinbefore that a suit was filed by the company through Sarafs against Shanti
Narayan Verma praying for a declaration that the property belonged to the company. The said suit
was decreed by a judgment dated 19.8.1982 declaring that the company is the absolute owner
thereof. It is also not in dispute that the Board of Directors of the company adopted a resolution on
6.9.1984 for sale of the said property in favour of the appellant herein for a sum of Rs.11,00,000/-.
The agreement for sale was signed by the Directors, namely, Pushpa Devi Saraf and Mohan Lal Saraf
and their son Sandeep Saraf. The company also discharged a part of the debts of State Bank of India,
out of the amount of the advance of Rs.10,00,000/- received by it from the appellants herein. The
company had also adopted another resolution for leasing out the property to Manoj Kumar Poddar.
The deed of lease in favour of Manoj Kumar Poddar was also signed by Sarafs. In the said
documents it was clearly and unequivocally stated that the property belonged to the company.

It is the company again which executed a general power of attorney in favour of Shri M.M. Agarwal
for executing the deed of sale of the disputed property in favour of the appellants, upon getting the
property released from the Bank. In the said power of attorney also, the company had been
described as owner of the property.

There cannot, therefore, be any doubt whatsoever that for all intent and purport the Company was
the owner of the property and at all material times Sarafs had made representations as such to the
appellants as also to others thereabout.

Unincorporated Corporation issue :

At the time when the property was released from the charge held by the State Bank of India, a notice
in terms of Section 138 of the Companies Act was issued by Shri Mohan Lal Saraf. In the registers
maintained by the Registrar of the Companies under Section 132 of the Companies Act, it was shown
that a charge of the said property had been made in favour of the State Bank of India.

Under the English Common Law, an unincorporated corporation could not have become an owner
of the property. The law in India, however, is different.

Before we advert to the statutes operating in the field, in passing we may notice a wholly untenable
submission of Shri Sudhir Chandra that an unregistered deed of sale only having been executed in
favour of the company by Sarafs, no title passed to the company in view of Section 54 of the Transfer
of Property Act. Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, defines sale and provides for a procedure
as to how the same shall be made. It does not speak of conveyance of ownership. Section 54 of the
Transfer of Property Act does not lay down a law as to whether in all situations an apparent state of
affairs as contained in a deed of sale would be treated to be the real state of affairs. It does not bar a
benami transaction. There is no embargo in getting a property registered in the name of one person;
although real beneficiary thereof would be another.

Sections 15(h) and 19(e) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 read as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 7Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

"15. Who may obtain specific performance. - Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, the
specific performance of a contract may be obtained by XXX XXX XXX

 

 

 

 

(h) when the promoters of a company have, before its incorporation, entered into a contract for the

company :

Provided that the company has accepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to the
other party to the contract."

In terms of Section 15(h) of the Specific Relief Act, the Promoters of a company before its
incorporation could enter into a contract for the benefit of the company and such contract may be
warranted by the terms of incorporation of the company. The said provision is subject to the proviso
that the company should accept the said transaction. In the instant case, indisputably it was done.
Section 19(e) of the Act provides for grant of a decree of specific performance of a contract against a
company when the promoters of a company before incorporation entered into a contract for the
purpose of the company and such contract is warranted by the terms of incorporation. The said
provision applies herein.

In Weavers Mills Ltd., Rajapalayam vs. Balkis Ammal & Ors. [AIR 1969 Mad. 462], the Madras High
Court clearly held that Section 19(e) of the Specific Relief Act carves out an exception from the
common law of England, stating :

"While we accept the position that a promoter is neither an agent nor a trustee of the company
under incorporation, we are inclined to think that in respect of transactions on behalf of it, he stands
in a fiduciary position. For the plaintiff-company Sections 92 and 94 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882,
were relied upon. It seems to us that neither of these sections is of assistance to it. These sections, as
we think, contemplate transactions as between persons in existence. In any case, it seems to us that
no trust as defined by Section 3 of the Act is brought about by the purchases made by the promoters.
The legal position of a promoter in relation to his acts, particularly purchase of immoveable
properties on behalf of the company under incorporation, is a peculiar one not capable of being
brought into any established or recognised norms of the law as to its character as an agent or a
trustee. But, at the same time, it is impossible, to our minds, to deny that he does stand in a certain

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 8Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

fiduciary position in relation to the company under incorporation. When he does certain things for
the benefit of it, as for instance, purchase of immoveable properties, he is not at liberty to deny that
benefit to the company when incorporated. We are prepared to hold that in such a case the benefit
of the purchase will pass on to the company when incorporated."

The said decision has been followed by a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vali
Pattabhirama Rao & Anr. vs. Sri Ramanuja Ginning & Rice. Factory (P.) Ltd. & Ors. [AIR 1984 A.P.
176], wherein it was held :

"Thus, we hold that if the constitution of the partnership firm is changed into that of a company by
registering it under Part 9 of present Act (Part 8 of previous Act), there shall be statutory vesting of
title of all the property of the previous firm in the newly incorporated company without any need for
a separate conveyance."

The company upon incorporation has accepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to
the other party. Besides that, purchase of the property was for the purpose of the company.
Submissions of Mr. Sudhir Chandra that acquisition of a property for the benefit of the company
must find place in the articles of association of the company, is wholly misplaced. What is meant by
acceptance of the contract by the company which is to be warranted by its incorporation, is that it is
not ultra vires the purpose for which the company had been incorporated. The distinction sought to
be made by the learned counsel between Section 27 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 and Section 19 of
the 1963 Act is not of much significance. Under the 1877 Act, not only ratification and adoption of
the contract was mandatory, such contract was to be warranted by the terms of the incorporation.
The words ‘ratified and adopted" have been dropped from the main section and in Section 19 of the
1963 Act, a proviso has been added that the company has accepted the contract and communicated
such acceptance to the other party of the contract. An express ratification of the contract, therefore,
is no longer warranted. In view of the fact that the Company, in the suit filed against Verma, sought
for a declaration that it was the owner of the property, the same, in our opinion, would amount to
acceptance of the contract and communication thereof to the other party thereto.

Reliance placed by the learned senior counsel for the respondent on Shamsu Suhara Beevi v. G. Alex
& Anr. [(2004) 8 SCC 569, para 11] is not apposite, wherein it was held :

"(On equitable considerations court cannot ignore or overlook the provisions of the statute. Equity
must yield to law."

In the said decision this Court was not concerned with the interpretation of Section 19(e) of the
Specific Relief Act.

Transfer of Property Act does not prohibit an oral transfer. The statute merely provides that if the
value of the said property is more than Rs.100/- a registered document is required to be executed.
Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act provides for transfer in favour of the company which was
unincorporated. The effect of the Transfer of Property of Act, therefore, postulates transfer in favour
of unincorporated company. It does not create any bar.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 9Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

Our attention was drawn to a statement made by the appellant No.1 before the trial court in
cross-examination. He stated that Sarafs had informed him that the company was the owner. He,
however, volunteered that he himself as also the company became owners. He probably gave the
said answer having regard to the fact that an agreement for sale had been executed in his favour;
and furthermore Manoj Kumar Poddar had been granted a lease and thus, he also became the owner
thereof. His claim may not be correct in law, but by reason thereof, it cannot be said that the
representation made by Sarafs that the company was the owner of the property had been whittled
down or the appellants were all along aware that Sarafs were the owners thereof.

The High Court, therefore, in our opinion committed a gross error in opining that the object and
purport of the proceedings in OS No.267 of 1980 was mainly for seeking foreclosure of the right of
reconveyance of Vendor S.N. Verma.

Estoppel issue :

It may be true that no issue as regards title between Sarafs and the said S.N. Verma having been
framed in O.S.No.267 of 1980, the principle of res judicata is not applicable. In the said proceedings,
however, Sarafs as also the said S.N. Verma being parties, there cannot be any doubt or dispute
whatsoever that a claim was laid by the company that it was the owner of the property which was
accepted not only by Verma but also by Sarafs. The Sarafs or Verma did not deny or dispute the
same. In fact company spoke only through Sarafs. The High Court overlooked the fact that the plaint
was signed by Sarafs and the company was represented by them. It is they who had made solemn
statement before a competent court of law that the company was the owner of the property. Hence,
they are bound by the said statement. The principle of estoppel and/or acquiescence would, thus, be
applicable.

While applying the procedural law like principle of estoppel or acquiescence, the court would be
concerned with the conduct of a party for determination as to whether he can be permitted to take a
different stand in a subsequent proceeding, unless there exists a statutory interdict. If principle of
estoppel applies, Sarafs will not be permitted by a court of law to raise the contention that the
company was not the owner of the property.

It is one thing to say that the property did not vest in the company as there was a statutory embargo
in that behalf; but it is another thing to say that a person is estopped from raising a question of title.
The provisions of the Indian Evidence Act are clear like Section 116, whereby in certain situation a
person may be estopped from pleading a title in himself.

We are, however, not oblivious of the principle of law that mere admission does not create title but
while determining such a question that intention of the parties as to in whom the title of the
property shall vest, the conduct of the parties assumes significance.

In the instant case, it was Sarafs who represented the company. They had made the representation
that the company was the owner of the property. Such a representation had been made to the

appellant herein not only in terms of the decree obtained in the said O.S. No.267 of 1980, but by

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 10Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

reason of execution of the other documents including creation of mortgage of the property and
discharge thereof in favour of the State Bank of India. If by reason of such representation, a third
party alters his position, indisputably, the principle of estoppel would apply. We may, however,
hasten to add that where there exists a statutory embargo, vesting of title in a person shall be subject
thereto. We have, however, in this case, no doubt whatsoever that there did not exist any statutory
embargo in this behalf.

In Bank of India & Ors. etc. vs. O.P. Swarnakar & Ors. etc. [(2003) 2 SCC 721], this Court took notice
of the following passage from Halsbury's Law of England, 4th Edn., Vol.16 (Reissue), para 957 at
p.844:

"On the principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate a special species of estoppel has
arisen. The principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate expresses two propositions:

(1) That the person in question, having a choice between two courses of conduct is to be treated as
having made an election from which he cannot resile.

(2) That he will be regarded, in general at any rate, as having so elected unless he has taken a benefit
under or arising out of the course of conduct, which he has first pursued and with which his
subsequent conduct is inconsistent."

In Gillett v Holt and another [2000 (2) All. E.R.-289], the Court of Appeal, upon referring to a large
number of decisions, developed the doctrine of proprietary estoppel opining:

"The overwhelming weight of authority shows that detriment is required. But the authorities also
show that it is not a narrow or technical concept. The detriment need not consist of the expenditure
of money or other quantifiable financial detriment, so long as it is something substantial. The
requirement must be approached as part of a broad inquiry as to whether repudiation of an
assurance is or is not unconscionable in all the circumstances."

In Indu Shekhar Singh & Ors. vs. State of U.P. & Ors. [2006 (5) SCALE 107], this Court stated :

"They, therefore, exercised their right of option. Once they obtained entry on the basis of election,
they cannot be allowed to turn round and contend that the conditions are illegal."

In Pawan Alloys and Casting Pvt. Ltd. , Meerut vs. U.P. State Electricity Board & Ors. [(1997) 7 SCC
251], this Court applied the principle of promissory estoppel.

The doctrine of estoppel by acquiescence was not restricted to cases where the representor was
aware both of what his strict rights were and that the representee was acting on the belief that those
rights would not be enforced against him. Instead, the court was required to ascertain whether in
the particular circumstances, it would be unconscionable for a party to be permitted to deny that
which, knowingly or unknowingly, he had allowed or encouraged another to assume to his
detriment. Accordingly, the principle would apply if at the time the expectation was encouraged.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 1Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006
[See also Taylor Fashions Ltd. v. Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co. Ltd. (1981) 1 All ER

897.] Similarly, in Amalgamated Investment & Property Co. Ltd. vs. Texas Commerce International
Bank Ltd. [(1981) 1 All ER 923], it was held :

"Where the estoppel alleged was founded on active encouragement or representations made by the
representator, it was only unconscionable for the representator to enforce his strict legal rights if the
representee's conduct was influenced by the encouragement or the representation. However, it was
not necessary for the encouragement or representation to have been the initial cause of the
representee's conduct in order to be unconscionable but merely that his conduct was so influenced
by the encouragement or representation that it would be unconscionable for the representor to
enforce his legal rights."

Mr. Sudhir Chandra placed strong reliance in Mahboob Sahab v. Syed Ismail & Ors. [(1995) 3 SCC
693], wherein this Court was dealing with the issue of res judicata.

As in this case, we have already held that the principle of res judicata may not have any application,
it is not necessary to advert thereto. It is also not a case where fraud was alleged, as was the fact
involved therein.

Reliance placed on Chhaganlal Keshavlal Mehta vs. Patel Narandas Haribhai [(1982) 1 SCC 223:
AIR 1982 SC 121] was misplaced. Therein it was held that a person is entitled to plead estoppel in his
individual character and not as a representative of his assignee. In this case ingredients constituting
an estoppel and in particular the representation made by Sarafs that it was the company which was
the owner of the property, were raised specifically.

In the context of the present case it is of some significance to note the following observations made
in Chapleo and Wife v. The Brunswick Permanent Building Society and Others [1881 QBD 696]:

"

 

[Being not incorporated the individual members might be liable like any other individuals for what
has been done under an implied authority given to their agent to borrow. That the borrowing power
was exceeded is a matter which could only be known to the officers of the society, and not to the
persons who lent their money, and the society must be liable for the fraud or wrongful act of their
agent who was held out as having authority to borrow for the societyL]

It was further held :

"It must be taken that when the directors represented that they had authority which they had not, by
reason of the limit to borrowing having been passed, they nevertheless warranted to the plaintiff
Chapleo that they had that authority. Therefore upon that ground they are liable."

The Judicial Committee in Sarat Chunder Dey and Others v. Gopal Chunder Laha and Others
[(1892) Vol. XIX Law Report 203], as regards the conditions of estoppel under the Evidence Act,

opined :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 12Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

"(The law of this country gives no countenance to the doctrine that in order to create estoppel the
person whose acts or declarations induced another to act in a particular way must have been under
no mistake himself, or must have acted with an intention to mislead or deceive. What the law and
the Indian statute mainly regard is the position of the person who was induced to act; and the
principle on which the law and the statute rest is, that it would be most inequitable and unjust to
him that if another, by a representation made, or by conduct amounting to a representation, has
induced him to act as he would not otherwise have done, the person who made the representation
should be allowed to deny or repudiate the effect of his former statement, to the loss and injury of
the person who acted on it. If the person who made the statement did so without full knowledge, or
under error, sibi imputet. It may, in the result, be unfortunate for him, but it would be unjust, even
though he acted under error, to throw the consequences on the person who believed his statement
and acted on it as it was intended he should do."

Lifting the Corporate Veil :

In a case of this nature, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, even the doctrine of
lifting the corporate veil would be applicable.

We would, in this regard, notice some precedents operating in the field.
In Kapila Hingorani vs. State of Bihar [(2003) 6 SCC 1], this Court opined :

"It is now well settled that the corporate veil can in certain situations be pierced or lifted. The
principle behind the doctrine is a changing concept and it is expanding its horizon as was held in
State of U.P. v. Renusagar Power Co. The ratio of the said decision clearly suggests that whenever a
corporate entity is abused for an unjust and inequitable purpose, the court would not hesitate to lift
the veil and look into the realities so as to identify the persons who are guilty and liable therefor."

{See also Union of India & Ors. vs. M/s. Playworld Electronics Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. [(1989) 3 SCC 181:
AIR 1990 SC 202], State of U.P. & Ors. vs. Renusagar Power Co. & Ors. [(1988) 4 SCC 59 : AIR 1988
SC 1737] and Yukong Line Ltd. of Korea v. Rendsburg Investments Corp of Liberia and Others (No
2) [(1998) 4 All ER 82 (QBD)} The application of the said doctrine becomes relevant in view of the
fact that in the Memorandum of Association of the company Sarafs alone were shown to be the
subscriber members of the company. In the Article of Association they were naturally inducted as
the first Directors. Subsequently they included their son as a Director; and it was all the three of the
Directors who executed the agreement for sale. There had, thus, been no shareholder except Sarafs.
Since, they had been attempting to use the personality of the company for furthering their own

Leffect of :

 

One of the judges of the High Court in the impugned judgment opined that in view of the fact that
the appellant had withdrawn the suit questioning the said award and the decree subsequent to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 13Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

passing of the judgment and decree of the trial court, they became disentitled to raise the said
question. In so opining, the High Court committed a manifest error. The appellant had contended
that the said award and the consequent decree passed by the Delhi High Court was a fraudulent and
collusive one. The appellants having obtained a decree, it was not necessary for them to obtain
another decree. It might not have been able to file another suit, but the same would not mean that
they were not entitled to question the validity or otherwise of the said award in the suit for specific
performance of contract. If a judgment or decree is vitiated by fraud, the same would be a nullity. In
such an event, Section 44 of the Indian Evidence Act would be attracted. As a plea of fraud can be
raised even in a collateral proceeding and the trial court having recorded a specific finding that the
jurisdiction of the Delhi Court was created artificially by including a Delhi property, in respect
whereof there was no dispute, the said decree must be held to have been obtained by Sarafs by
concealment of material facts and by a collusive and fraudulent exercise.

In the arbitration proceedings, Sarafs stated that the agreement dated 12.06.1984 was in fact a sale
transaction. In paragraph 8 of the written statement, the stand taken by them was that the
agreement was a sham document entered into by and between the parties so as to enable them to
secure removal of padlocks by State Bank of India, Kanpur.

In the said written statement itself they, however, disclosed about the execution of an agreement for
sale in favour of the defendant no.5. The said agreement was registered on 29.09.1984 i.e. much
after the execution of agreement for sale dated 12.6.1984 as also after the institution of the suit.

It is now well settled that fraud vitiated all solemn act. Any order or decree obtained by practicing
fraud is a nullity. {See - (1) Ram Chandra Singh vs. Savitri Devi & Ors. [(2003) 8 SCC 319] followed
in (2) Vice Chairman, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan & Anr. vs. Girdhari Lal Yadav [(2004) 6 SCC

163].} The submission of Mr. Sudhir Chandra that withdrawal of the Suit No.1252 of 1985 without
obtaining liberty to file a fresh suit would constitute a bar in filing of a second suit under Order 23,
Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in the factual matrix obtaining herein, cannot be accepted. By
withdrawal of the said suit, the appellant did not and could not have given up their right to contend
that the said award and decree were fraudulent.

It was not necessary for the appellants to reserve their right to raise the said contention by
instituting another suit as they had earlier done it in their suit. In fact they had already obtained the

decree for specific performance of the agreement to sell.

In that view of the matter, the decision of this Court in Hulas Rai Baij Nath vs. Firm K.B. Bass & Co.
[4967) 3 SCR 886], relied on by the Sudhir Chandra is not applicable.

Nature of transaction :

One of the learned Judges of the High Court also held that the said agreement dated 12.06.1984 was
in fact an agreement for obtaining loan. There was no warrant for such a proposition. Clause 7 of the
agreement on the basis whereof such a finding was arrived at reads as under :

"(7) That it is further agreed that in case any defect in the right or title of the parties of the first part
or the said company is found or any other encumbrance or legal hurdle is found in respect of the
said house property then in both the circumstances the second party shall have option for the refund
of advance money of Rs.10 lacs together with interest @ 18% per annum."

It is interesting to note that the sale deed dated 24.02.1979 whereby Sarafs purchased the property
also contain an identical clause. Such types of clauses normally are found in the agreement so as to
enable the vendee to protect his interest against the defects in vendor's title, if any. The agreement
records the valuation of property at Rs.11 lakhs. The respondents relying on or on the basis of
another purported agreement dated 04.06.1984 executed by Sarafs in favour of their son-in-law,
original defendant No.5, S.K. Mittal stated that the property was worth Rs.25 lakhs. The trial court,
in our opinion, correctly arrived at an opinion that the said agreement was a shame one. The
original defendant No.5 did not file any suit for specific performance of contract. The said
agreement for sale had not been acted upon by the parties. Reliance placed on the said agreement by
a learned Judge of the High Court was, therefore, unwarranted.

The High Court in its judgment did not show as to how the said finding of the learned trial court in
that behalf was wrong. Moreover, except the said agreement, no other legal evidence was brought on
record to establish as to what was the actual market value of the property.

The value of the property, as noticed hereinbefore, was only Rs.2 lakhs in the year 1979. Within a
period of 5 years thereof as per the agreement for sale, its price went up five times over the original.
It is, wholly unlikely that the property which was valued at Rs.2 lakhs in 1979, would be worth Rs.25
lakhs in 1984.

In any view of the matter inadequate consideration by itself would not lead to the conclusion that
the same was an agreement of loan. Inadequate consideration, it is trite, is also not a ground for
refusing to grant a decree for specific performance of contract.

Clause 5 of the said agreement required the company to satisfy the appellants in regard to the
ownership of the company in the said property and the same was free from encumbrances, the
reason wherefor is not far to seek. The provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling Act were in force.
Permission was required for completing the said transaction both under the Urban Land Ceiling
(Regulation) Act, 1976 as also under the Income Tax Act. In terms of Sections 26 of 1976 Act, a
notice was required to be served on the competent authority. At least the parties appear to have
proceeded on that basis. Strong reliance has been placed on the circumstance that when an
advertisement issued in the newspaper on 5.8.1984 notifying the existence of agreement for sale
between the appellants and the respondents, Sarafs responded thereto alleging that the said
transaction was a loan transaction. By reason of such self-serving statement alone, an agreement for
sale validly entered into by and between the parties would not be treated to be a loan agreement. It

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 15Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

is furthermore interesting to note that in the said purported response to the advertisement
published in the paper also, Sarafs did not raise any plea that the company had already entered into
an agreement for sale of property with a third person or that the dispute as regard title thereof was
pending adjudication before an arbitrator. If Sarafs claimed themselves to be the owner of the said
property, they should have challenged the subsequent agreement also. The contention of the
respondents that the said agreement was merely one of loan was an afterthought.

Conduct of Sarafs :

It is in the aforementioned situation, the conduct of Sarafs assumes significance. The agreement for
sale was executed on 12.6.1984, pursuant to the resolution of the Board of Directors dated
08.6.1984, which was followed by execution of a General Power of Attorney in favour of M.M.
Agarwal for the purpose of redeeming the mortgage from State Bank of India, Kanpur and other
purposes. They evidently with a design either to defraud the State Bank of India or for other
purposes best known to them, purported to have inducted Vijay Kumar as Director of the company
on 4.6.1984. Soon thereafter a purported dispute was raised on 6.6.1984 by and between the said
Vijay Kumar on the one hand and Sarafs on the other, as regards the ownership of the property. One
B.S. Mathur, Advocate, was appointed as arbitrator on 7.6.1984. If the said documents were in
existence on 8.6.1984, Sarafs themselves could not have been a party to the resolution in regard to
the execution of the agreement for sale of the company's property in favour of the appellant as also
letting out of the same to Manoj Kumar Poddar. It has not been denied nor disputed that the said
Vijay Kumar was merely an employee.

The arbitrator was appointed in undue haste. Within a few days, so many events took place, which
itself is a pointer to the evil design on the part of Sarafs. It is of some significance to note that the
appointment of Shri Vijay Kumar as Director of the company was intimated to the Registrar of the
Companies on 29.9.1984, and the same had been received in his office only on 7.1.1985.

Not only Sarafs intended to wriggle out of the agreement to sell, they even intended to play fraud on
the State Bank of India as 'the property’ was charged in its favour and the amount received from the
appellant by way of advance, had been utilized for the purpose of redeeming the mortgage.

The arbitrator made an award on 20.11.1984. It has not been denied or disputed that the decree
dated 19.8.1982 passed in O.S. No.267 of 1980 had not been placed before the arbitrator. Attention
of the arbitrator had also not been drawn to the proceedings of pending suit filed by the appellant
herein for specific performance of the said agreement of sale dated 12.6.1984 being O.S. No.537 of
1984. The arbitrator furthermore was not made known about the pendency of another suit filed by
Manoj Kumar Poddar against the company being Suit No.612 of 1984 and the order of ex parte
injunction passed therein on 31.8.1984. The arbitrator while passing an award on 20.11.1984 might
not have any other option but to declare Sarafs to be the owners of the property as the purported lis
between the parties went uncontested. Interestingly by reason of the said award, Sarafs were
directed to refund Rs.2,22,500/- to the company, which had been paid to them. The company did
not raise any objection evidently because nobody else could factually represent it before the
arbitrator; all the parties being on the same side.

It is interesting to note that before the arbitrator, the company was shown to be the claimant and
thus, the company itself is said to have appointed Shri Mathur as sole arbitrator. Such appointment
of the arbitrator, being in the teeth of the decree passed in Suit No.267 of 1980, arbitration award
and the decree passed by the Delhi High Court, had rightly been held by the learned trial judge as
collusive and fraudulent. It was thus a nullity. Even in the proceedings for making the award a rule
of the court before the Delhi High Court being Suit No.1857-A of 1984, there was no opposition on
the part of the company. Although a decree for delivery of possession was passed against the
company, the lessee Shri Manoj Kumar Poddar or the appellant had not been made parties therein.
We would have occasion to deal with the effect of our discussions hereafter.

Subject matter of the agreement :

One of the learned Judges of the High Court also opined that as the agreement to sell referred to
only the house or the bungalow, the parties did not agree to sell the land. We have gone through the
agreement for sale and are of the opinion that the views taken by the learned judge were wholly
unwarranted. Apparently the respondents intended to sell what they had purchased. There is
nothing in the averments of the agreement to suggest that the intention of the respondents was
restricted to the house alone and not the lands. There was no basis for arriving at the said findings.
In any event, expression 'the house’ will also include the land appurtenant thereto.

In P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Advanced Law Lexicon, Volume 2, 2005, the word "house" has been
defined to mean :

"HOUSE" means a house suitable for occupation by a Military Officer or a military mess. The term
includes the land and buildings appurtenant to a house.

[Cantonment (House Accommodation) Act (6 of 1923), S. 2(f)] "HOUSE" includes any building or
part of a building with its appurtenances and outhouses used for any purpose whatsoever [Orissa
House Rent Control Act, 1967 (4 of 1968), S. 2(3)].

 

"HOUSE" includes

 

 

 

(a) any part of a building occupied or intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling, and

(b) any yard, garden, outhouses and appurtenances belonging to it or usually enjoyed with it
[Housing Act, 1996 (c. 52 1996), S. 6B(1)]"

In 'Word and Phrases, Permanent Edition, Volume 19A, it is stated :
"The word "building" necessarily embraces the foundation on which it rests; and the cellar, if there
be one, under the edifice, is also included in the term "house" or "building". If there be a cellar, the

word "building" includes it, unaffected by the height above the foundation Benedict v. Ocean Ins.

394.

Furthermore, it is now well settled that the building includes the land on which it stands, unless by
express stipulation it is excluded. [See T. Lakshmipathi & Ors. vs. P. Nithyananda Reddy & Ors.
(2003) 5 SCC 150, paras 19 to 24] Re : Demolition of the building:

Both the learned judges of the High Court found that the appellants were responsible for demolition
of the building forming the part of the property.

Before adverting to the said question, we may, at the cost of repetition, notice the contentions,
which, according to Mr. Dwivedi, sufficiently indicate that Sarafs alone were responsible therefor.

On the basis of the Award of the Arbitrator, a decree was passed by the Delhi High Court on
21.2.1985. Sarafs executed the said decree. A warrant of delivery of possession was issued against
the Company. Pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof Manoj Kumar Poddar was said to have
been dispossessed, despite an order of interim injunction passed in Suit No.612 of 1984 on
19.10.1984 operating in this behalf. An application for restoration of possession was filed by the said
Manoj Kumar Poddar under Order 21 Rule 99 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the said execution
case, which was registered as Miscellaneous Case No.184/74 of 1985. In the said application, Sarafs
were sought to be restrained from damaging and destroying any portion of the suit property and
from parting with the possession. An order of injunction restraining Sarafs from causing any
damage or destruction and parting with the possession of the suit property was passed.

In response to the said application, Sarafs contended that they were required to execute a project of
construction work. The contentions of Sarafs were noted by the learned trial Judge in the following
words:

"The opp. parties maintained that they have to execute project of construction work in place of
existing disputed building. It is therefore, clear that the opp. parties No.1 and 2 have intention to
demolish or change the nature of the existing premises."

It was further opined:

"The applicant would suffer irreparable injury in case the opp. parties are successful in demolishing
the building."

The said findings by itself, as was submitted by Mr. Dwivedi, in our opinion, would not be sufficient
to draw an inference that Sarafs were responsible for demolition of the building. We are not
oblivious of the fact that thereafter G.P. Tiwari instituted Rent Case numbered as Rent Case
No.99/87 against the Sarafs. The appellants were not impleaded as parties therein. G.P. Tiwari was
allegedly the caretaker of the building. An ex- parte order was passed on 25.8.1989 directing eviction
of Sarafs and granting possession of the premises in his favour. The said order was implemented
and possession of the said premises was delivered on 23.9.1989. It is not in dispute that the building
was demolished on the same day. It is furthermore not in dispute that Mohan Lal Saraf filed an

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 18Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

application for setting aside the said ex-parte order dated 23.9.1989. On 24.9.1989, in relation to the
said order, Smt. Pushpa Devi Saraf also filed a Writ Petition being W.P. No.21985/89 for quashing
of the ex-parte order dated 25.8.1989. The ex-parte order was recalled. The writ petition was
dismissed only on the premise that the ex-parte order had been recalled. In fact, the Rent Case itself
was withdrawn by G.P. Tiwari on 8.2.1990. The respondents contended that G.P. Tiwari was the
man of the appellants. We have, in this behalf, hereinbefore noticed the conduct on the part of the
appellants. One of the appellants and G.P. Tiwari filed a special leave petition together. They had
also engaged the same counsel for defending themselves in the proceedings before this court.

It has been found by the High Court while determining the writ petition that Sarafs had represented
before various authorities, Government functionaries and police complaining about the said
unauthorized demolition of the structure. Collusion of the police authorities with the appellants had
also been alleged, although not substantiated. Only on 23.9.1989 a First Information Report was
lodged. Charge-sheets were filed against the appellants in terms of an order dated 9.12.1993 in
Criminal Writ Petition No.23804/89, in terms whereof the Central Bureau of Investigation was
directed to record a First Information Report against the appellants and others. It is not disputed
that in April, 1994, the Central Bureau of Investigation, after investigation filed a charge-sheet
against the appellants for demolition of the said building and for alleged commission of other
offences relating to theft, criminal conspiracy, trespass, etc. It is also not in dispute that in the said
proceedings, charges have been framed and a large number of witnesses have already been
examined.

It is true that Sudhir Parasrampuria filed a suit in the Court of Civil Judge, Kanpur Dehat against
Sarafs and also against the said G.P. Tiwari for a declaration that they had no right to damage the
property and for its preservation through a Receiver contending that the Sarafs had got the house
demolished through G.P. Tiwari who was their dummy. An interim order was passed in the said suit
on 23.10.1989 permitting grant of symbolic possession to the appellants. But the said order,
admittedly, had been set aside by the High Court by an order dated 9.5.1990 in Writ Petition
No.21985/89 on the ground that service of notice had not been properly effected upon Sarafs and
the matter was remanded to the competent court, but, in the meantime, the suit itself was
withdrawn by an order dated 30.5.1990. G.P. Tiwari, in response to the application for recalling the
ex- parte order passed in Rent Case No.99/87, stated that he had been appointed as caretaker by
Manoj Kumar Poddar. It is not in dispute that Manoj Kumar Poddar is a cousin of Sudhir
Parasrampuria. We may moreover notice that against the order dated 9.12.1993 passed by the
Allahabad High Court, special leave petitions were filed by G.P. Tiwari and also by A.C. Verma, Civil
Judge, Kanpur, which were dismissed. Circumstances pointed out hereinbefore prima facie do not
lead to a conclusion that Sarafs were responsible for demolition of the structures in question.

In view of the pendency of the criminal case, we do not intend to express a definite opinion on one
way or the other on the said issue. The sequence of events noticed hereinbefore would go to show
that the balance in regard to demolition of the said structure tilts against the Appellants, in view of
the charge-sheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation although the same itself may not be
conclusive in nature. There is no reason for us, as at present advised, to take a different view from
that of the High Court in this behalf.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 19Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

There are other circumstances too which cannot be ignored.

The possession of the land in question was directed to be delivered by the Civil Court in favour of
G.P. Tiwari. On the same date, the buildings were demolished. The respondents, therefore, on the
said date were armed with the orders of the court; the Appellants were not. The circumstances are
such which lead us to a finding for the purpose of disposal of this case that the Appellants were
responsible for demolishing the building.

For the aforementioned reasons, we would uphold the findings of the High Court that the Appellants
were responsible for demolition of the structures standing on the land in question.

Discretionary relief:

Both the parties hereto are guilty of serious misconduct. Both of them have abused the process of
court. They initiated unnecessary nay frivolous proceedings against each another. Both the parties
took recourse to abuse of judicial process against the other upon suppression of material fact, which
would amount to fraud on court. The question in regard to exercise of discretionary jurisdiction for
grant of a decree of specific performance of contract, as envisaged under Section 20 of the Specific
Relief Act, must be considered from the said angle.

Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act reads thus:

"20. Discretion as to decreeing specific performance.- (1) The jurisdiction to decree specific
performance is discretionary, and the court is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is
lawful to do so; but the discretion of the court is not arbitrary but sound and reasonable, guided by
judicial principles and capable of correction by a court of appeal.

(2) The following are cases in which the court may properly exercise discretion not to decree specific
performance:
(a) where the terms of the contract or the conduct of the parties at the time of entering into the
contract or the other circumstances under which the contract was entered into are such that the
contract, though not voidable, gives the plaintiff an unfair advantage over the defendant; or

(b) where the performance of the contract would involve some hardship on the defendant which he
did not foresee, whereas its non-performance would involve no such hardship on the plaintiff; or

(c) where the defendant entered into the contract under circumstances which though not rendering
the contract voidable, makes it inequitable to enforce specific performance.

Explanation 1.- Mere inadequacy of consideration, or the mere fact that the contract is onerous to

the defendant or improvident in its nature, shall not be deemed to constitute an unfair advantage
within the meaning of clause (a) or hardship within the meaning of clause (b).

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 20Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

Explanation 2.- The question whether the performance of a contract would involve hardship on the
defendant within the meaning of clause (b) shall, except in cases where the hardship has resulted
from any act of the plaintiff subsequent to the contract, be determined with reference to the
circumstances existing at the time of the contract.

(3) The court may properly exercise discretion to decree specific performance in any case where the
plaintiff has done substantial acts or suffered losses in consequence of a contract capable of specific
performance.

(4) The court shall not refuse to any party specific performance of a contract merely on the ground
that the contract is not enforceable at the instance of the party."

Balancing of equities in a case of this nature is a difficult task. It is now well settled that
compensation can be awarded in lieu of grant of decree of specific performance of contract. The
courts are now evolving separate principles in regard to the remedy of compensation. (See Snells'
Equity, page 452.) The learned author cites various cases to make home the point stating:

"18-17 A monetary award which is made in substitution for (or in addition to) non-monetary relief
will frequently be determined on the basis of pecuniary performance or pecuniary rescission; but, in
some cases, may also be determined by reference to the loss which has been suffered.

18-18 (a) Pecuniary performance. Pecuniary performance is a money substitute for the thing which
the defendant would have been required to do, had specific relief been ordered. It is to be
determined by identifying the difference between two values: (i) the value of the claimant's right to
performance of the obligation and (ii) the value of the performance which the defendant is able to
give. Where the defendant is not able to perform the obligation, the amount of the award will
represent the value of the claimant's right to performance : in such a case, an order for pecuniary
performance will be for a sum corresponding with the value of the claimant's right to performance.
The position is similar where the court declines to grant non-monetary relief and thereby (in effect)
releases the defendant from the need to perform the obligation in the future."

In Spry's Equitable Remedies, it is stated:

"In considering what circumstances induce the court, as a matter of discretion, to award equitable
damages rather than relief in specie it must be borne in mind that when once the general conditions
for the exercise of equitable jurisdiction have been established, that is, the inappropriateness of
damages in respect of a matter coming within a recognized head of relief, prima facie there arises a
right to specific performance or to an injunction, as the case may require. So it was observed by Lord
Langdale, "I conceive the doctrine of the court to be this, that the court exercises a discretion, in
cases of specific performance, and directs a specific performance unless it should be what is called
highly unreasonable to do so." Similarly reference has been made to "the rule that where the
plaintiff has established the invasion of a common law right, and there is ground for believing that
without an injunction there is likely to be a repletion of the wrong, he is, in the absence of special
circumstances, entitled to an injunction against such repetition."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 21Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

On the one hand it is clear that the passage of provisions for equitable damages did not affect these
general principles. So it has been affirmed that the authorities show "that Lord Cairns’ Act did not
revolutionise the principles upon which the equitable jurisdiction had been administered up to that
time and that some special case must be shown before the court should exercise the jurisdiction
under the Act". On the other hand, in cases where an injunction or an order of specific performance
would be granted if there were no power to grant damages the statutory power of the court to award
damages may, in special circumstances, be of critical weight. It may induce the court to conclude
that any inconvenience or hardship which would be caused to the plaintiff if he were obliged to
accept merely an award of damages would be so far outweighed by the hardship that would be
caused to the defendant if specific enforcement were granted that damages constitute the most
appropriate remedy. Hence where the court would otherwise have granted specific relief the
importance of a power to grant equitable damages is found to lie primarily in its relation to
considerations of hardship between the parties and to the balance of convenience."

In Gillett (supra), it was pointed out:

"Since Mr. Gillett has established his claim to equitable relief, this court must decide what is the
most appropriate form for the relief to take. The aim is (as Sir Arthur Hobhouse said in Plimmer v
Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 App Cas 699 at 714) to 'look at the circumstances in each case to
decide in what way the equity can be satisfied’. The court approaches this task in a cautious way, in
order to achieve what Scarman LJ (in Crabb v Arun DC [1975] 3 All ER 865 at 880, [1976] Ch 179 at
198) called 'the minimum equity to do justice to the plaintiff’. The wide range of possible relief
appears from Snell's Equity (30th edn, 1999) pp 641
"

643.

For the aforementioned purpose it is necessary to have a broad approach, as was observed in Gillett
(supra). Therein it was further held:

"That is in my view the maximum extent of the equity. The court's aim is, having identified the
maximum, to form a view as to what is the minimum required to satisfy it and do justice between
the parties. The court must look at all the circumstances, including the need to achieve a 'clean
break’ so far as possible and avoid or minimize future friction (see Pascoe v Turner [1979] 2 All ER
945 at 951, [1979] 1 WLR 431 at 438
439)."

In Malhotra v Choudhury 1979 (1) All ER 186, Stephenson, LJ., in the fact situation obtaining
therein, opined:

"But as counsel for the plaintiff pointed out, the question which the judges were summoned by their
Lordships to answer and which was proposed for their consideration was 'Whether, upon a contract
for the sale of real estate, where the vendor, without his default [my emphasis], is unable to make a
good title, the purchaser is by law entitled to recover damages for the loss of his bargain?’ That is the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 22Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

question which was answered in the judgment of Pollock B, which was also the judgment of Kelly
CB, Keating and Brett, JJ, and the question as it was stated by both Denman J and Pigott B. I note
this is the way in which the rule is stated in Williams on Contract of Sale of Land, cited by Megarry J
in Wroth v Tyler:

‘Where the breach of contract is occasioned by the vendor's inability, without his own fault [my
emphasis], to show a good title, the purchaser is entitled to recover as damages his deposit, if any,
with interest, and his expenses incurred in connection with the agreement, but not more than
nominal damages for the loss of his bargain." It is not necessary to decide how far the words ‘without
his default' go, if I am right in thinking that inability without default is what one has to consider as
attracting the rule in Bain v Fothergill.

There may be cases in which there has been no lack of bona fides, yet the rule in Bain v Fothergill
has been excluded. I would not however venture to suggest that anything less than lack of good faith
could exclude the rule. But it seems from later decisions that fraud, in the full sense of that word
such as would found an action for deceit, may not be necessary to exclude the rule. No doubt
Blackett-Ord V-C had in mind that fraud must be strictly alleged and proved in all ordinary
circumstances. But in my judgment, unwillingness to use best endeavours to carry out a contractual
promise is bad faith, and for there to be bad faith which takes the case out of this exceptional rule it
is not necessary that there should be either a deliberate attempt to prevent title being made good or
anything more than the unwillingness which I find it inevitable to infer in this case. If a man makes
a promise and does not use his best endeavours to keep it, it cannot take much and, in my judgment,
may not need more to make him guilty of bad faith and to entitle the victim of his bad faith to his full
share of damages to compensate him for what he has lost by reason of that breach of contract and
bad faith."

In so far as the principle relating to assessing damages in substitution for an order of specific
performance is concerned, the learned Judge opined that a court of equity should follow law and
address itself to find the proper substitute, stating that the equitable remedy of specific performance
has features markedly different from damages at common law for breach of contract. [See also
Horsler and another v Zorro, 1975 (1) All ER 584.] Having noticed the law operating in the filed
vis- *-vis the conduct of the parties, we decline to grant a decree for specific performance of contract
and opine that in its stead and place a decree for compensation should be granted.

What should be the amount of compensation is now the question.

Law as declared by this Court is that the quantum and measure of damages would vary from case to
case.

We may notice a few of them.
In Lalit Kumar Jain & Anr. vs. Jaipur Traders Corporation Pvt. Ltd. [(2002) 5 SCC 383], this Court,

while directing dismissal of the suit, opined:

"

 

(However, in view of the fact that the defendants are not free from blame as discussed above and
they have utilized the property to the best of their advantage right from day one without, at the same
time, paying the balance sale price for several years, we put it to the counsel for the appellants
whether they are willing to pay to the plaintiff a substantial amount over and above the sale price
already deposited in the Court, in order to do justice to the parties. In fact, in the course of
arguments by the learned counsel for the appellants, there was an indication that the appellants
were prepared to offer a reasonable amount, without prejudice to their contentions. The learned
counsel for the appellants has filed a letter dated 18-4-2002 stating that "the appellants can pay and
agree to pay a further sum of Rs.35 lakhs (Rupees thirty-five lakhs) in 3 instalments of Rs.15 lakhs
and Rs.10 lakhs and Rs.10 lakhs", in three weeks, by the end of August and by the end of November
2002 respectively. When we suggested to the learned counsel that it would be fair if some more
amount is offered, the learned counsel for the appellants agreed on behalf of his clients for payment
of Rs.40 lakhs in lump sum within a period of six months commencing from today. Having regard to
the offer made in the letter coupled with the oral representation made today and to mete out justice
to the parties, we direct that the undertaking to pay the sum of Rs.40 lakhs within six months
should form part of the decree in the suit. This shall be in addition to the sale price already
deposited in the Court. The same shall be deposited in the Court within a period of six months and
the plaintiffs are entitled to withdraw the same in addition to the amount already deposited."

In Manjunath Anandappa urf Shivappa Hanasi vs. Tammanasa & Ors. [(2003) 10 SCC 390], was a
member, a decree for specific performance was declined as the plaintiff did not approach the court
within a reasonable time.

In P.D'Souza vs. Shondrilo Naidu [(2004) 6 SCC 649], this Court rejected the contention that
inadequacy of consideration may be ground for refusing relief of specific performance, which may
cause hardship stating:

"It is not a case where the defendant did not foresee the hardship. It is furthermore not a case that
non-performance of the agreement would not cause any hardship to the plaintiff. The defendant was
the landlord of the plaintiff. He had accepted part-payments from the plaintiff from time to time
without any demur whatsoever. He redeemed the mortgage only upon receipt of requisite payment
from the plaintiff. Even in August, 1981 i.e. just two months prior to the institution of suit, he had
accepted Rs.20,000 from the plaintiff. It is, therefore, too late for the appellant now to suggest that
having regard to the escalation in price, the respondent should be denied the benefit of the decree
passed in his favour. Explanation I appended to Section 20 clearly stipulates that merely inadequacy
of consideration, or the mere fact that the contract is onerous to the defendant or improvident in its
nature would not constitute an unfair advantage within the meaning of sub-section (2) of Section
20."

The Court noticed that somewhat a different note was struck in Nirmala Anand vs. Advent Corpn.
(P) Ltd & Ors. [(2002) 5 SCC 481] and opined:

"The said decision cannot be said to constitute a binding precedent to the effect that in all cases
where there had been an escalation of prices, the court should either refuse to pass a decree on

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 24Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

specific performance of contract or direct the plaintiff to pay a higher sum. No law in absolute terms
to that effect has been laid down by this Court nor is discernible from the aforementioned decision."

In Surinder Singh vs. Kapoor Singh (Dead) through LRs. & Ors. [(2005) 5 SCC 142], it was
emphasized that discretionary jurisdiction must be exercised reasonably and having regard to the
fact situation obtaining in each case. The present market value of the property is also a relevant fact.
The prices must have gone up manifold. It is situate in a metropolitan town. It has a great potential
value.

As noticed hereinbefore, the conduct of both the parties are blameworthy. The value of the property
is now said to be a few crores. The appellants had deposited a sum of Rs.10 lakhs as far back as on
12.6.1984. The said amount must be directed to be refunded to the appellants with interest @15%
per annum. Although we decline to grant any relief of specific performance of contract to which the
Appellants were otherwise entitled to, we are of the opinion that it is a fit case where the
respondents should be asked to compensate the Appellants. In view of the fact that the Sarafs are
also responsible for bringing out such a situation, we are of the opinion that interest of justice would
be met if the respondents are directed to pay a sum of Rs.50,00,000/- to the Appellants herein by
way of compensation. Such amount should be in addition to the sum of Rs.10,00,000/- deposited by
the Appellants together with interest at the rate of 12% per annum thereupon. This order shall not
preclude Manoj Kumar Poddar to bring an independent action against the respondents herein, if he
so desires.

Conclusion:

(i) The property in suit for all intent and purport was acquired for the benefit of the Company.

(ii) Only because at the time of acquisition of the property by Sarafs, the Company was
unincorporated, the same would not mean that no title could have been passed in favour of the

Company.

(iii) In view of their conduct, Sarafs were estopped and precluded from denying and disputing the
title of the Company over the property in dispute.

(iv) Withdrawal of suit No. 1252 of 1982 by the appellants did not create any embargo in raising a
contention that the award of the arbitrator and the consequent decree passed were void ab initio and
of no effect.

(v) The agreement for sale dated 11.6.1984 was not a transaction for loan.

(vi) Saraf's conduct was condemnable so far as they not only raised false and frivolous pleas but also
initiated frivolous proceedings in courts of law.

(vii) The subject matter of the agreement was not only the house in question but also the entire
lands.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1414476/ 25Jai Narain Parasurampuria (Dead) ... vs Pushpa Devi Saraf & Ors on 24 August, 2006

(viii) Prima facie the demolition of the house took place at the instance of the appellants.

(ix) However, it is not a case where the appellants are entitled to a decree for specific performance of
contract.

(x) The respondents should refund the amount of advance of Rs.10,00,000/- (ten lakhs) with
interest and furthermore pay compensation to the extent of Rs.50,00,000/- (fifty lakhs).

The appeals are allowed to the aforementioned extent. However, in the facts and circumstances of
these cases, the parties shall bear and pay their own costs.

Appeal (civil) 2063 of 1999

KONDA LAKSHMANA BAPUJI

GOVT. OF ANDHRA PRADESH & ORS.

BENCH:
Syed Shah Mohammed Quadri & S.N. Phukan

JUDGMENT :
SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI, J.

This appeal, by special leave, is from the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of
Judicature, Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad dated October 27, 1998 dismissing Writ Petition No.5332
of 1993, filed by the appellant assailing the order of the Special Court under A.P.Land Grabbing
(Prohibition) Act, 1982 (for short, 'the Act’) in L.G.C.No.61 of 1990 dated April 16, 1993. The Special
Court had upheld the claim of the first respondent (the State of Andhra Pradesh represented by its
Chief Secretary) that the appellant was a land grabber of land of an extent of 2 acres 06 guntas,
comprised in Survey Nos.9/15 Paiki, 9/16, and 9/17 of Khairathabad Village, Golconda Mandal,
Hyderabad District (for short, 'the land in dispute’) and directed the appellant to restore possession
of that land to the first respondent in terms of the decree. To comprehend the controversy in the
appeal it would be appropriate to set out the relevant facts. The appellant traces his title to the land
in dispute under an unregistered agreement for perpetual lease executed by one of the successors of
the Inamdar, Mohd. Noorudin Asrari, in respect of the Inam land in Survey Nos.9/15, 9/16, 9/17
and 9/18, on November 28, 1954 (Ex.B-39). Later the said Asrari executed a registered perpetual
lease deed in favour of the appellant on December 11, 1957 (a certified copy is marked as Ex.B-40).
Soon thereafter one Rasheed Shahpurji Chenoy had set up a rival claim to the land in dispute by
filing Original Suit No.13 of 1958, in the Court of the Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court,
Hyderabad, against the first respondent, the appellant and others praying for declaration of title to
and recovery of possession of the said land. In that suit the learned Additional Chief Judge passed
an interim order directing the parties to maintain status quo in regard to the land in dispute.
However, the appellant having sought permission of the court, constructed a building "Jala

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 1Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

Drushyam" on the land in dispute on his giving an undertaking that in the event of the plaintiff
therein succeeding in the suit, the building would be vacated by him, leaving the structures intact,
without claiming any compensation. On November 11, 1975 the said suit of Rasheed Shahpurji
Chenoy was dismissed recording the finding that he did not have any title to the suit land which was
the Government land (Ex.A-1).

It appears that as a follow up action of the minutes of the committee held in the chamber of the
Chief Secretary to the Government of Andhra Pradesh, the Deputy Secretary, G.A.D. (O.P.LLL) by
his letter dated September 14, 1959 (Ex.B-35) asked the Collector, inter alia, to declare the land
situated between the Secretariat and the Fisheries Department (which includes the land in dispute)
as the Government land. Thereafter on October 5, 1959, the Collector passed order declaring Survey
No.9/15 paiki, 9/16, 9/17, 9/18 and 9/19 admeasuring 19 acres 29 guntas as Government Land and
informed the Chief Secretary accordingly on October 20, 1959 (Ex.A-14 and Ex.B-34).

On February 28, 1976, the Tehsildar, Hyderabad, Urban Taluk, noticing that the appellant was in
unauthorised occupation of Government land, issued eviction notice calling upon him to vacate the
land comprised in Survey No.9/15 paiki, 9/16 & 9/17 admeasuring 2 acres 28 guntas (Ex.B-38).
Pursuant to the said notice, an order of eviction was passed against the appellant on May 28, 1977
(Ex.B-58). That order was challenged by the appellant in Writ Petition No.1414 of 1977 in the High
Court of Judicature, Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad. A learned single Judge of the High Court
allowed the writ petition on January 20, 1978 (Ex.A-3). Questioning that order the first respondent
filed W.A.No.61 of 1978 before the Division Bench. It would be relevant to note here that the Act
came into force on September 6, 1982 but that fact was not brought to the notice of the Division
Bench at the hearing of the Writ Appeal. The Division Bench opined that there was bona fide dispute
of title to the land in dispute between the appellant and the Government which must be adjudicated
upon by the ordinary court of law and that the Government could not decide unilaterally in its own
favour and resort to summary eviction proceedings under the Andhra Pradesh Land Encroachment
Act, 1905 (for short, 'the Land Encroachment Act') and dismissed the Writ Appeal on November 14,
1983 (Ex.A-4). The appellant again filed Writ Petition 15724 of 1984 apprehending his dispossession
from the land in dispute. On June 16, 1986, a learned Single Judge of the High Court disposed of the
Writ Petition taking note of the observations of the Division Bench in the said Writ Appeal and the
fact that the first respondent had filed, O.S. No1497 of 1985 in the Court of the IV Additional Judge,
City Civil Court, Hyderabad for declaration of title and recovery of possession of land in dispute on
November 25, 1985.

In view of the provisions of sub-section (8) of Section 8 of the Act, the said suit of the first
respondent was transferred to the Special Court from the Court of the IV Additional Judge. Though
the order of the transfer of the suit was challenged by the appellant in the High Court by filing civil
revision petition, it was later dismissed as not pressed. Be that as it may, the first respondent filed
an application invoking jurisdiction of Special Court for taking cognizance of the case and prayed
that the plaint in the said suit be read as part of the application. Thereupon, the Special Court issued
notification for consideration of objections under the first proviso to sub- section (6) of Section 8 of
the Act in the Andhra Pradesh Gazette on April 1, 1992. The Special Court, after considering the
objections filed by the appellant taking cognizance of the case, LGC No.61 of 1990 (referred to in this

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 2Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

judgment as 'the case’), tried the case as a civil suit. The parties were given opportunity to lead
evidence both oral and documentary. The first respondent examined P.W.1 and marked Exs.A-1 to
A-48; the appellant examined himself as R.W.1 and marked Exs. B-1 to B-65. By consent of the
parties Exs.X-1 to X-4 (copies of various plans) were also marked. After considering the evidence
adduced by both the sides the Special Court decreed the case of the first respondent on April 16,
1993 which was upheld by the Division Bench of the High Court in the said W.P.No.5332 of 1993
(filed by the appellant) by its judgment and order dated October 27, 1998 which is under challenge
in this appeal.

Three main contentions were elaborated by Mr.K. Parasaran, the learned senior counsel appearing
for the appellant. His first contention is that the appellant could not be held to be a land grabber as
his possession was alleged to be permissive by the first respondent and he was found to have prima
facie bona fide claim to the property in dispute by the High Court in Writ Petition No.1414 of 1977
and Writ Appeal No.61 of 1978. The second contention is that the Special Court had no jurisdiction
to try the case and the third contention is that, in any event, the appellant had perfected his title to
the land in dispute by adverse possession.

Mr.Altaf Ahmad, the learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for the first respondent, has
argued that the questions whether the appellant is a land grabber and whether he has title to the
land in dispute or it is a government land, were decided by the Special Court after trial and the
appellant had ample opportunity to establish his case; the appellant challenged the order of the
transfer of the suit from the Civil Court to the Special Court in the High Court by filing a civil
revision petition; he, however, did not press it. After the said questions were found against him by
the Special Court, submitted Mr.Ahmad, the appellant could not be permitted to challenge the
jurisdiction of the Special Court and they, being the findings of fact, are not open to challenge in
appeal filed under Article 136 of the Constitution.

These contentions can conveniently be dealt with together.

On the contentions, urged before us, we find that the Special Court framed Issue Nos.3, 5 and 6
which are as follows:

"(3) Whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit as it raises bona fide dispute of title?

(5) Whether the respondent perfected title by adverse possession?

(6) Whether the respondent is a land grabber within the meaning of the Act?"

It was held, on those issues, that the Special Court had jurisdiction to try the case; the appellant did
not prescribe title by adverse possession and that the appellant was a land grabber. The findings
recorded by the Special Court were approved by the High Court in the writ petition filed by the
appellant. The correctness of those findings are assailed in this appeal. Before proceeding further, it
is appropriate to determine the question of jurisdiction of the Special Court. On this question, it is

noted above, Issue No.3 was framed and the Special Court held that it had jurisdiction. The High

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 3Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

Court after adverting to the relevant provisions of the Act, concluded :

"We find, therefore, in the totality of the situation and in view of the specific provisions as laid down
by the Act, the Special Court was within its jurisdiction to deal with the matter and to go into the
case as to whether there is any title involved in favour of the writ petitioner. Incidentally, be it noted
that the statute itself has equated the Special Court with that of a Civil Court with all the powers of
the Civil Court. Elaborate and detailed enquiry has been conducted by way of a regular trial like any
other civil suit, and like any other civil suit, evidence has been recorded and considered and the
Special Court came to a definite finding. Does it warrant intervention of the writ court on the basis
of the above? The answer cannot but be in the negative."

Having regard to the principles laid down by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Dhulabhai & Ors.
Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. [1968 (3) SCR 662], it will be apt to advert to the scheme
and the provisions of the Act having a bearing on the question of jurisdiction of the Special Court
and Special Tribunal.

Section 17B of the Act provides that the schedule to the Act shall constitute the guidelines for the
interpretation and implementation of the Act. We have perused the Schedule to the Act containing
the Statement of Objects and Reasons to the Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Bill of
1982 as well as the Bill of 1987. The point that is sought to be made out in the Schedule is that
having regard to the increasing trend in grabbing the lands of the Government, local authorities,
wakfs, charitable and religious endowments, evacuees and private persons by unscrupulous and
resourceful persons forming a distinct class of economic offenders backed by wealth without any
semblance of right and having taken note of the delays in disposal of civil and criminal cases in the
regular courts, the State Legislature felt that unless all such cases of land grabbing are immediately
detected and dealt sternly and swiftly by specially devised adjudicating forums the evil cannot
subside and social injustice will continue to be perpetrated with impunity. The Act constituted a
Special Court, having both the civil and criminal jurisdiction, which consists of a serving or retired
Judge of a High Court (Chairman), a serving or retired District Judge and a serving or retired Civil
Servant not below the rank of a District Collector (as members) to entertain the cases in which the
magnitude of the evil needs immediate eradication so as to avoid duplication and to further the
cause of justice. The Court of the District Judge having jurisdiction over the area including Chief
Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, is constituted as a Special Tribunal to try cases of which
cognizance was not taken by the Special Court in regard to any alleged act of land grabbing or with
respect to ownership and title to or lawful possession of the land grabbed on or after the
commencement of the Act. Against any judgment or order of the Special Tribunal (not being
interlocutory order) an appeal is provided to the Special Court on questions of both law and fact.
The Special Tribunal has only civil jurisdiction and the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable to the
proceedings before it whereas the Special Court has both the civil as well as the criminal jurisdiction
to which the provisions of Codes of Civil Procedure and Criminal Procedure apply. Both the Special
Court as well as the Special Tribunals have power to reject any case brought before them if it is
prima facie frivolous or vexatious. It is provided that any case pending before any court or other
authority immediately before the commencement of the Act as would have been within the
jurisdiction of the Special Tribunal/Special Court, shall stand transferred to the Special

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 4Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

Tribunal/Special Court, as the case may be, as if the cause of action on which such suit or
proceeding is based, had arisen after such commencement. If the Special Court is of the opinion that
any case brought before it is not a fit case to be taken cognizance of, it may return the same for
presentation before the Special Tribunal. There is, however, no provision that the case should be
transferred back to the Civil Court if the final determination by the Special Tribunal or by the
Special Court results in recording a finding that the occupation of the land by the respondent does
not amount to land grabbing. This is because statutorily the Special Court is a Civil Court having
both original and appellate jurisdiction as well as a Court of Session for all practical purposes and
the District Judge having jurisdiction over the area in which land is alleged to be grabbed is
constituted as a Special Tribunal.

It is apt to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act. Section 2 contains definition of various terms
and expressions used in the Act. Section 3 of the Act which declares that land grabbing in any form
is unlawful and any activity connected with or arising out of land grabbing shall be an offence
punishable under the Act cannot be lost sight of. Section 4 of the Act ordains that no person shall
commit or cause to be committed land grabbing. It further declares that any person who, on or after
the commencement of this Act, continues to be in occupation, otherwise than as a lawful tenant, of a
grabbed land belonging to the Government, local authority, religious or charitable institution or
endowment including a wakf, or other private person, shall be guilty of an offence under the Act and
on conviction the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than
six months but which may extend to five years, and with fine which may extend to five thousand
rupees. Likewise Section 5 of the Act provides penalty for other offences in connection with land
grabbing. Offences by companies fall within the ambit of the Act as provided in Section 6 of the Act.

It will be useful to read Sections 7 to 10 of the Act which deal with the Special Court insofar as they
are relevant for the present discussion. They are as under :

"7, Constitution of Special Courts : 
(1) The Government may, for the purpose of providing speedy enquiry into any alleged act of land
grabbing, and trial of cases in respect of the ownership and title to, or lawful possession of, the land
grabbed, by notification, constitute a Special Court.

(2) to (5C) *** *** *** (5D)(i) Notwithstanding anything in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of
1908) the Special Court may follow its own procedure which shall not be inconsistent with the
principles of natural justice and fair play and subject to the other provisions of this Act and of any
rules made thereunder while deciding the Civil liability.

8. Procedure and powers of the Special Courts :

(1) The Special Court may, either suo motu or on application made by any person, officer or
authority take cognizance of and try every case arising out of any alleged act of land grabbing or with

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 5Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

respect to the ownership and title to, or lawful possession of, the land grabbed, whether before or
after the commencement of this Act, and pass such orders (including orders by way of interim
directions) as it deems fit;

(1-A) The Special Court shall, for the purpose of taking cognizance of the case, consider the location,
or extent or value of the land alleged to have been grabbed or of the substantial nature of the evil
involved or in the interest of justice required or any other relevant matter :

Provided that the Special Court shall not take congnizance of any such case without hearing the
petitioner.

(2) Notwithstanding anything in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 or in the Andhra Pradesh Civil Courts Act, 1972, any case in respect of an alleged act of land
grabbing or the determination of question of title and ownership to, or lawful possession of any land
grabbed under this Act, shall be triable only in a Special Court constituted for the area in which the
land grabbed is situated; and the decision of the Special Court shall be final.

(2-A) If the Special Court is of the opinion that any case brought before it, is not a fit case to be taken
congnizance of, it may return the same for presentation before the Special Tribunal :

Provided that if, in the opinion of the Special Court, any application filed before it is prima facie
frivolous or vexatious, it shall reject the same without any further enquiry :

Provided further that if on an application from an interested person to withdraw and try a case
pending before any Special Tribunal the Special Court is of the opinion that it is a fit case to be
withdrawn and tried by it, it may for reasons to be recorded in writing withdraw any such case from
such Special Tribunal and shall deal with it as if the case was originally instituted before the Special

9. Special Court to have the powers of the Civil Court and the Court of Session :
Save as expressly provided in this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the
Andhra Pradesh Civil Courts Act, 1972 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in so far as they
are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, shall apply to the proceedings before the Special
Court and for the purposes of the provisions of the said enactments, Special Court shall be deemed
to be a Civil Court, or as the case may be, a Court of session and shall have all the powers of a Civil
Court and a Court of session and the person conducting a prosecution before the Special Court shall
be deemed to be a Public Prosecutor.

grabbed, and such land is prima facie proved to be the land owned by the Government or by a
private person the Special Court or as the case may be, the Special Tribunal shall presume that the
person who is alleged to have grabbed the land is a land grabber and the burden of proving that the
land has not been grabbed by him shall be on such person."

Section 7 of the Act envisages constitution of Special Courts. Sub-section (1) of Section 7 enables the
Government to constitute a Special Court for the purpose of providing speedy enquiry into any
alleged act of land grabbing and trial of cases in respect of the ownership and title to, or lawful
possession of the land "grabbed" which in the context includes "alleged to have been grabbed".
Clause (i) of sub-section (5D) enables the Special Court to follow its own procedure which shall not
be inconsistent with the principles of natural justice and fair play subject, of course, to the other
provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder while deciding the civil liability. Clause (ii) of
sub-section (5D) of Section 7 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Section 260 or
Section 262 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 every offence, punishable under this Act, shall
be tried in a summary way and the provisions of Sections 263 to 265 (both inclusive) of the said
Code, shall apply to such trial. Section 8 of the Act specifies the procedure and powers of the Special
Court. Sub- section (1) of Section 8 authorises a Special Court to take cognizance of and try every
case arising out of any alleged act of land grabbing either suo motu or on application made by any
person, officer or authority. It has also the power to try every case with respect to the ownership and
title to, or lawful possession of the land alleged to have been grabbed whether before or after the
commencement of the Act and pass such orders including interim orders as it deems fit.

It is pertinent to note that mere allegation of an act of land grabbing is sufficient to invoke the
jurisdiction of the Special Court. In both Section 7(1) and Section 8(1) of the Act the phrase ‘any
alleged act of land grabbing’ is employed and not ‘act of land grabbing’. It appears to us that it is
designedly done by the legislature to obviate the difficulty of duplication of trial once in the courts
under the Act and over again in the ordinary Civil Court. The purpose of the Act is to identify cases
involving allegation of land grabbing for speedy enquiry and trial. The courts under the Act are
nonetheless Civil Courts which follow Code of Civil Procedure and are competent to grant the same
reliefs which can be obtained from ordinary Civil Courts. For the purpose of taking cognizance of the
case the Special Court is required to consider the location or extent or value of the land alleged to
have been grabbed or of the substantial nature of the evil involved or in the interest of justice
required and to give an opportunity of being heard to the petitioner (sub-section (1-A). It is plain
that sub-section (2) opens with a non obstante clause and mandates that notwithstanding anything
in the Code of Civil Procedure, the Code of Criminal Procedure, or in the Andhra Pradesh Civil
Courts Act, 1972, any case in respect of an alleged act of land grabbing or the determination of
question of title and ownership to, or lawful possession of any land alleged to have been grabbed
under the Act, shall be triable only in a Special Court constituted for the area in which the land
grabbed is situated and the decision of the Special Court shall be final. Sub-section (2B) specifically
provides that notwithstanding anything in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it shall be lawful
for the Special Court to try all offences punishable under this Act. It is left to the Special Court to
determine the order in which the civil and criminal liability against a land grabber be initiated.
Sub-section (6) provides that every finding of the Special Court with regard to any alleged act of land
grabbing shall be conclusive proof of the fact of the land grabbing and of the persons who
committed such land grabbing and every judgment of the Special Court with regard to
determination of title and ownership to, or lawful possession of, any land alleged to have been
grabbed, shall be binding on all persons having interest in such land. It contains three provisos but
they are not relevant for the present discussion. Sub-section (8) brings about automatic transfer of
any case pending before any court or authority immediately before the constitution of a Special

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 8Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

Court, as would have been within the jurisdiction of the Special Court if the cause of action on which
such suit or proceeding is based, has arisen after the constitution of the Special Court. The
provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 8 which commences with a non obstante clause confer
jurisdiction on the Special Court and Section 15 of the Act directs that the provisions of the Act shall
have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time
being in force or custom, usage or agreement or decree or order of a court or any other tribunal or
authority. A combined reading of these provisions leads to the conclusion that the jurisdiction of
Civil Court under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure and under the Civil Courts Act is ousted
and the Act which is special law will prevail and as such the Special Court will have jurisdiction in
respect of the matters dealt with thereunder. [See : Sanwarmal Kejriwal vs. Vishwa Cooperative
Housing Society Ltd. & Ors. [1990 (2) SCC 288]. Section 9 provides, inter alia, that except as
expressly provided in this Act, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, insofar as they are
not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, shall apply to the proceedings before the Special
Court and for purposes of the said Code, the Special Court shall be deemed to be a Court of Session
and shall have all the powers of Court of Session.

The discussion of the above provisions would be incomplete without taking note of Section 10 of the
Act which is a procedural provision and deals with burden of proof. A plain reading of this section
would indicate that in any proceedings under this Act - (i) where a land is alleged to have been
grabbed; and (ii) such land is prima facie proved to be the land owned by the Government or by a
private person, the Special Court/Special Tribunal shall presume that the person who is alleged to
have grabbed the land is a land grabber. When the presumption under Section 10 is drawn by the
Special Court/Special Tribunal, the burden of proving that the land has not been grabbed by him is
cast on the alleged land grabber. In view of the meaning of the words "shall presume" in Section 4 of
the Indian Evidence Act, the effect of raising presumption under Section 10 of the Act would be that
unless the alleged land grabber disproves that the land has been grabbed by him, the Special
Court/Special Tribunal shall regard that the land in question has been grabbed by the alleged land
grabber.

It has been noticed above that O.S.No.1497 of 1985 filed by the first respondent in the Court of the
IV Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, was transferred to the Special Court in view of the
provisions of sub-section (8) of Section 8 of the Act. The order transferring the case from the Civil
Court to the Special Court was assailed by the appellant in the High Court in a civil revision petition
which was later dismissed as not pressed. Irrespective of the answer to the question whether the
order of transfer of the said suit from the Civil Court to the Special Court operates as issue estoppel
or not, it is plain that the validity of the order of transfer of the suit from the Civil Court to the
Special Court was not urged before the High Court in the writ petition (filed to challenge the
judgment of the Special Court), out of which this appeal arises, so the transfer of the suit cannot be
allowed to be challenged in this appeal. Be that as it may, the following facts disclose that de hors
the transfer of the suit, the jurisdiction of the Special Court was invoked by the first respondent
under the Act.

The first respondent filed petition under sub-section (1) of the Section 7 read with sub-section (1) of
Section 8 of the Act before the Special Court on March 20, 1992 complaining of the alleged act of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 9Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002
land grabbing and praying the Court to declare the appellant as a land grabber and the structures
raised thereon by him as unauthorised and to order his eviction from the land grabbed and deliver
possession of the same. The Special Court issued notification under Rule 7(1) of the Land Grabbing
Rules, which was published in the A.P.Gazette on April 1, 1992 which reads as follows :

In response to the said notice the appellant filed his objections on April 10, 1992. He denied the
allegation of land grabbing but did not object to the jurisdiction of the Special Court. After
considering the objections, filed by the appellant, to the Special Court taking cognizance of the case
numbered as L.G.C.No.61/90, the case was decided on the evidence adduced by the parties before
the Special Court.

In this context the following submission, pressed by Mr.Parasaran, may be considered here. He
argued that the High Court in the Writ Petition filed by the appellant challenging the validity of the
notice of eviction under the Land Encroachment Act, gave liberty to the first respondent to establish
its title in Civil Court, which was also confirmed by the Division Bench in the writ appeal filed by the
first respondent; although before the date of the disposal of the writ appeal the Act had come into
force on September 6, 1982, the first respondent did not seek liberty from the court to approach the
Special Court, therefore, on the principle of "might and ought" he was barred from approaching the
Special Court and the proceeding before the Special Court was barred by the principle of res
judicata. Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure incorporates the principle of res judicata which, in
short, means a matter which has already been adjudged judicially between the same parties. In
substance, Section 11 bars a court from trying any suit in which the matter directly and substantially
in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties in a
court and has been heard and finally decided by such court which is competent to try such
subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised. Eight Explanations are
appended to it. We are concerned with Explanation IV which embodies the principle of constructive
res judicata and says that any matter which "might and ought" to have been made a ground of
defence or attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly and
substantially in issue in such suit. A conjoint reading of Section 11 and Explanation IV shows that if
a plea which might and ought to have been taken in the earlier suit, shall be deemed to have been
taken and decided against the person raising the plea in the subsequent suit.

Mr.Parasaran relied upon the judgment of the Privy Council in Sha Shivraj Gopalji vs. Edappakath
Ayissa Bi & Ors. [AIR 1949 PC 302]. In that case, the appellant filed second execution petition and
sought to attach the right, title and interest of the respondent in the properties on the basis of the
Mappilla Marumakkattyam Act, 1938 (Act of 1938). A Division Bench of the High Court of Madras
referred to the contention urged in subsequent proceedings at the stage of appeal that the
assignee-decree-holder could proceed against the tavazhi properties under the said Act was not dealt
with on merits in those proceedings and held that that was a point which the appellant could have
raised in his petition in the earlier proceedings and he failed to do so and therefore the dismissal of
the earlier execution petition filed in 1940 operated as res judicata in the subsequent case. While
approving the said conclusion of the High Court, the Privy Council observed, "Apart from the
provisions of Section 11, Civil P.C. it would be contrary to principle (see Ram Kirpal Shukul vs. Rup
Kuari, [11 1.4.37 : (6 ALL. 269 PC)], to allow him in fresh proceedings to renew the same claim viz.,
that the properties in question were properties of the respondents liable to attachment or, as he
would now put it, that the respondents had severable interests in the properties which are liable to
attachment, merely because he neglected at the proper stage in previous proceedings to support that
claim by an argument of which he now wishes to avail himself."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 11Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

It may be noticed that in that case there was final determination of the rights of the parties in the
first execution petition in which the plea of executability of the decree against the right, title and
interest of the respondents by virtue of Act of 1938 was available but was not urged. In the instant
case, there has been no final determination of the rights of the parties in regard to their title to the
land in dispute in the writ proceeding.

The principle that to attract the provisions of Section 11, C.P.C., there must be a final adjudication of
the matter between the parties in earlier suit or proceeding is too well-settled to need elaboration.
The same principle applies to constructive res judicata. In Kewal Singh vs. Lajwanti [AIR 1980 SC
161] this Court held :

veeeveond as regards the question of constructive res judicata it has no application whatsoever in the
instant case. It is well settled that one of the essential conditions of res judicata is that there must be
a formal adjudication between the parties after full hearing. In other words, the matter must be
finally decided between the parties. Here also at a time when the plaintiff relinquished her first
cause of action the defendant was nowhere in the picture, and there being no adjudication between
the parties the doctrine of res judicata does not apply."

It may be recalled that in this case the first respondent issued notice for eviction of the appellant
from the land in dispute (under the Land Encroachment Act) on the ground that he was
unauthorisedly in occupation of the Government land. As the appellant claimed title to the land in
dispute and thus the title of the first respondent to the land in question was disputed, the High
Court observed that the State could not resolve the issue of title in its favour and proceed under the
Land Encroachment Act. In view of the rival claims to the land in dispute the High Court granted
liberty to the first respondent to establish its title in the competent Civil Court. It is true that on the
date of disposal of the Writ Appeal No.61 of 1978 (14.11.1983) the Act had come into force and that
fact was not brought to the notice of the Division Bench of the High Court but there was no final
adjudication on the question of rival claims of the parties to the title of the land in dispute on merit
in Writ Appeal by the Division Bench of the High Court. Pursuant to the liberty granted to the first
respondent by the learned Single Judge which was confirmed by the Division Bench the
aforementioned suit, O.S.No.1497 of 1985, was in fact filed by the first respondent against the
appellant in the Court of the IV Additional Judge, City Civil Court for declaration of title to and
recovery of possession of the land in dispute. The first respondent had thus acted in accordance with
the liberty granted to it by the High Court. It is by operation of law, under sub-section (8) of Section
8 of the Act, the said suit stood transferred to the Special Court. The first respondent also invoked
the jurisdiction of the Special Court under Sections 7 and 8 of the Act by filing a petition against the
appellant. For the reasons, stated above, the principle of constructive res judicata, on the ground
that the fact of enforcement of the Act on September 6, 1982 was not brought to the notice of the
Division Bench of the High Court at the time of disposal of the Writ Appeal, is not available to the
appellant. Further, as a statutory right is created in favour of the State under the Act, to eradicate a
public mischief, it cannot be precluded from having recourse to the provisions of the Act by
operation of the principle of "might and ought" in Explanation IV of Section 11 C.P.C. when its title
or interest had not been finally determined by the High Court. For these reasons, we cannot accept
the contention of the learned senior counsel.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 12Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

The upshot of the above discussion is that the Special Court is a Civil Court having original as well as
appellate jurisdiction having all the trappings of a Civil Court and also a Criminal Court having
powers of the Court of Sessions to which the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, the A.P. Civil
Courts Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure, apply. The Special Court can take cognizance of and
try every case arising out of any alleged act of land grabbing or with respect to the ownership and
title to, or lawful possession of, the land grabbed and determine the ownership, title to, or lawful
possession of the land alleged to have been grabbed whose decision will be binding on all the
persons interested. Mere allegation of land grabbing is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the
Special Court either suo motu or on application by any person including any officer or authority. In
this view of the matter, we find no illegality in the conclusion arrived at by the High Court in
affirming the finding with regard to the jurisdiction of the Special Court.

Now, adverting to the remaining two contentions, it is important to note that under the Act "land
grabbing" is not only an actionable wrong but also an offence and a "land grabber" is an offender
punishable thereunder. The definitions of the expressions "land grabber" and "land grabbing", in
clauses (d) and (e), respectively, of Section 2 of the Act, apply to both civil and criminal proceedings.
It is, therefore, essential to construe the definitions of the said expressions strictly. We shall first
examine the relevant provisions of the Act and then the case set up by the first respondent against
the appellant before the Special Court to describe him as a land grabber.

Clauses (d) and (e) of Section 2 of the Act may be quoted here :
"2. Definitions : - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, -
(d) "land grabber" means a person or a group of persons who commits land grabbing and includes
any person who gives financial aid to any person for taking illegal possession of lands or for
construction of unauthorised structures thereon, or who collects or attempts to collect from any
occupiers of such lands rent, compensation and other charges by criminal intimidation, or who
abets the doing of any of the above mentioned acts; and also includes the successors in interest;

(e) "land grabbing" means every activity of grabbing of any land (whether belonging to the
Government, a local authority, a religious or charitable institution or endowment, including a wakf,
or any other private person) by a person or a group of persons, without any lawful entitlement and
with a view to illegally taking possession of such lands, or enter into or create illegal tenancies or
lease and licences agreements or any other illegal agreements in respect of such lands, or to
construct unauthorised structures thereon for sale or hire, or give such lands to any person on rental
or lease and licence basis for construction, or use and occupation, of unauthorised structures; and
the terms "to grab land" shall be construed accordingly;"

A perusal of clause (d) shows that the expression "land grabber" takes in its fold : (1) a person ora
group of persons who commits land grabbing; (2) a person who gives financial aid to any person for
- (a) taking illegal possession of the lands, or (b) construction of unauthorised structures thereon;
(3) a person who collects or attempts to collect from any occupiers of such lands rent, compensation
and other charges by criminal intimidation; (4) a person who abets the doing of any of the above

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 13Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

mentioned acts; and (5) the successors in interest of such a person. Among these five categories, the
first category is relevant for the present discussion -- a person or a group of persons who commits
land grabbing.

Clause (e) of Section 2, quoted above, defines the expression "land grabbing" to mean : (1) every
activity of grabbing of any land (whether belonging to the Government, a local authority, a religious
or charitable institution or endowment, including a wakf, or any other private person) by a person
or group of persons; (2) such grabbing must be : (i) without any lawful entitlement and (ii) with a
view to : (a) illegally taking possession of such lands; or (b) to enter into or create illegal tenancies,
lease and licences agreements or any other illegal agreements in respect of such lands; or (c) to
construct unauthorised structures thereon for sale or hire; or (d) to give such lands to any person on
(i) rental or (ii) lease and licence basis for construction, or (iii) use and occupation of unauthorised
structures.

Inasmuch as the afore-mentioned expressions are defined employing the term "grabbing", it is
necessary to ascertain the import of that term. It is not defined in the Act. It is not a technical term

or a term of art so it has to be understood in its ordinary common meaning.

The meaning of the term "grab" in the New International Webster's Comprehensive Dictionary of
the English Language, is given as follows :

"To grasp or seize forcibly or suddenly; to take possession of violently or dishonestly; to make a
sudden grasp. See synonyms under grasp - (i) The act of grabbing, or that which is grabbed. (ii) A
dishonest or unlawful taking possession or acquisition (iii) An apparatus for grappling."

In Words and Phrases, permanent edition, Vol.18, the meaning of "grab" is noted as under :

"The word "grab" means an act or practice of appropriating unscrupulously, as in politics. Smith v.
Pure Oil Co., 128 S.W.2d 931, 933, 278 Ky.430.

The word "grab" means a seizure or acquisition by violent or unscrupulous means. Smith v. Pure Oil
Co., 128 S.W.2d 931, 933, 278 Ky.430.

The word "grab" means to seize, grasp, or snatch forcibly or suddenly with the hand, hence to take
possession of suddenly, violently, or dishonestly. Smith v. Pure Oil Co., 128 S.W.2d 931, 933, 278
Ky.430."

Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume 38, records the meaning of the term "grab" thus :

"As a verb, to seize, grasp or snatch forcibly or suddenly with the hand, hence to take possession of
suddenly, violently, or dishonestly."

In Concise Oxford Dictionary, the following meanings of the word "grab" are noted :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 14Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

"A seize suddenly; capture, arrest; take greedily or unfairly; attract the attention of, impress; make a
sudden snatch at; intr. (of the brakes of a motor vehicle) act harshly or jerkily. - n. (i) a sudden
clutch or attempt to seize; (ii)a mechanical device for clutching.”

The various meanings, noted above, disclose that the term "grab" has a broad meaning - to take
unauthorisedly, greedily or unfairly - and a narrow meaning of snatching forcibly or violently or by
unscrupulous means. Having regard to the object of the Act and the various provisions employing
that term we are of the view that the term "grab" is used in the Act in both its narrow as well as
broad meanings. Thus understood the ingredients of the expression "land grabbing" would comprise
of (i) the factum of an activity of taking possession of any land forcibly, violently, unscrupulously,
unfairly or greedily without any lawful entitlement and (ii) the mens rea/intention -- "with the
intention of/with a view to" (a) illegally taking possession of such lands or (b) enter into or create
illegal tenancies, lease and licences agreements or any other illegal agreements in respect of such
lands; or (c) to construct unauthorised structures thereon for sale or hire; or (d) to give such lands
to any person on (i) rental or (ii) lease and licence basis for construction, or (iii) use and occupation
of unauthorised structures.

A combined reading of clauses (d) and (e) would suggest that to bring a person within the meaning
of the expression "land grabber" it must be shown that : (i) (a) he has taken unauthorisedly, unfairly,
greedily, snatched forcibly, violently or unscrupulously any land belonging to government or a local
authority, a religious or charitable institution or endowment, including a wakf, or any other private
person; (b) without any lawful entitlement; and (c) with a view to illegally taking possession of such
lands, or enter or create illegal tenancies or lease and licences agreements or any other illegal
agreements in respect of such lands or to construct unauthorised structures thereon for sale or hire,
or give such lands to any person on rental or lease and licence basis for construction, or use and
occupation of unauthorised structures; or (ii) he has given financial aid to any person for taking
illegal possession of lands or for construction of unauthorised structures thereon; or

(iii) he is collecting or attempting to collect from any occupiers of such lands rent, compensation
and other charges by criminal intimation; or (iv) he is abetting the doing of any of the abovementioned acts; or (v) that he is the successor-in-interest of any such persons.

It must be borne in mind that for purposes of taking congnizance of a case under the Act existence of
an allegation of any act of land grabbing is the sine qua non and not the truth or otherwise of such
an allegation. But to hold that a person is a land grabber it is necessary to find that the allegations
satisfying the requirements of land grabbing are proved.

To make out a case in a civil case that the appellant is a land grabber the first respondent must aver
and prove both the ingredients -- the factum as well as the intention -- that the appellant falls in the
categories of the persons, mentioned above (clause (d) of Section 2 of the Act), has occupied the land
in dispute, which belonged to the first respondent, without any lawful entitlement and with a view to
or with the intention of illegally taking possession of such land or entering into the land for any of
the purposes mentioned in clause (e) of Section 2 of the Act, summarised above.

What needs to be looked into in the present controversy is : whether the appellant has any lawful
entitlement (proprietory or possessory) to the land in dispute and had come into possession of the
land in dispute unauthorisedly. Here, we may note the contention of Mr.Parasaran that in effect the
suit of the first respondent-plaintiff, being a suit for declaration of title and ejectment of the
appellant from the land in dispute, it ought to have been dismissed; the first respondent should
succeed on the strength of its own title and it cannot take advantage of the defects in the title of the
appellant to the land in dispute. We may notice the case set up by the parties in their pleadings and
the documentary and oral evidence adduced by them.

The case of the first respondent stated in the concise statement enclosed to the application filed
before the Special Court on March 20, 1992 and as contained in the plaint filed in the court of the IV
Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad (O.S. No.1497 of 1985) is as follows : the first
respondent is the absolute owner of the land of an extent of 2 acres and 6 guntas in Survey Nos.9/15
paiki, 9/16 and 9/17, forming part of the Hussain Sagar Tank Bund land, situated at Khairatabad
village, Hyderabad Dist., Hyderabad, there were wrong entries in the record of rights which were
corrected by the Collector on October 5, 1959. It is stated, alternatively, if the land in dispute formed
part of the Inam land the same had vested in the first respondent with effect from July 20, 1955, the
date of vesting as per Section 3 of the A.P. (Telangana Area) Abolition of Inams Act, 1955 (Act No.8
of 1955) (for short, 'the Inams Act’). None of the heirs of the alleged Inamdar appeared before the
Collector, Hyderabad Distt., Hyderabad, for claiming registration as occupants under Section 10 of
the said Act. The land in dispute, it is noted, was shown as Maqta land belonging to Naimatullah
Shah for some time and thereafter as Inam land and the appellant claimed to be the lessee of Mohd.
Nooruddin Asrari, one of the successors to the said Maqta; he occupied the said land in the year
1958 or so and raised a building known as "Jala Drushyam". The claim of the appellant was not
proper, valid and legal because the land never belonged to the said Maqta; even otherwise it vested
in the Government with effect from the said date and the order of the Collector, correcting entries in
the record of rights, had become final. The plaint refers also to the facts that the land in dispute was
the subject matter of O.S.No.13 of 1958 on the file of the Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court,
Hyderabad, filed by one Rasheed Shapurji Chenoy, which was dismissed holding that it was
Government land. On giving an undertaking in the said suit, the appellant with the permission of
the Court constructed the said house "Jala Drushyam" and, therefore, the possession of the
appellant partakes the character of permissive possession. After the dismissal of the suit the first
respondent issued notice of eviction to the appellant under Section 6 of the Land Encroachment Act,
on the ground that he was in unauthorised occupation of land in dispute, but the notice was quashed
in the writ petition filed by the appellant and that order was upheld in writ appeal giving liberty to
the first respondent to establish its title in a Civil Court. The first respondent sought from the
Special Court the following reliefs : to declare the appellant a land grabber and to restore possession
of the land grabbed by him.

The case of the appellant was that the land in dispute was part of Sarfekhas land and that after Inam
Inquiry, ordered by H.E.H. the Nizam, Muntakhab was issued in favour of the Inamdar (Maqtedar)
and thereafter succession was granted in favour of his vendor (lessor). It was also stated in the
written statement that the appellant has been in possession of the land from November 1954 and
that before him his predecessors-in- title were in possession for innumerable years as Inamdars, so

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 16Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

he was entitled to tack their possession for purposes of perfecting his title by adverse possession;
even otherwise from the date of his own coming into possession in 1954 he perfected his title by
adverse possession as against the first respondent.

The Special Court has determined that the occupation of the land in dispute by the appellant is
without any lawful entitlement and decided the question of the ownership and title to and lawful
possession of the land in dispute on appreciating the evidence on record. It held, inter alia, that the
land in dispute was not part of Inam and that even if it was so there was no valid confirmation of
grant of the land in dispute by the civil administrator under Ex.B-6 and consequently no title had
passed under Ex.B-9 to the vendor of the appellant and hence no title was obtained by the appellant
under Ex.B-40. Though the findings recorded by the Special Court in regard to absence of lawful
entitlement of the appellant to the land in dispute and upholding the title of the first respondent that
it is aGovernment land, are findings of fact which were not interfered with by the High Court in the
Writ Petition filed by the appellant, yet to satisfy ourselves, we have gone through the depositions of
PW 1 and RW 1 and perused the documentary evidence in great detail; the original record is in
Urdu. We find no valid reason to take a different view of the matter and inasmuch as we are
sustaining the said findings it is not necessary to re-do the whole exercise of discussing all the
evidence here. However, we shall refer to a few important documents and aspects which clinch the
issue. In regard to the ingredients of the expression ‘land grabber’, it is necessary to point out that it
is only when a person has lawful entitlement to the land alleged to be grabbed that he cannot be
brought within the mischief of the said expression. A mere prima facie bona fide claim to the land
alleged to be grabbed by such a person, cannot avert being roped in within the ambit of the
expression "land grabber". What is germane is lawful entitlement to and not a mere prima facie
bona fide claim to the land alleged to be grabbed. Therefore, the observation of the Division Bench
of the High Court in the said Writ Appeal No.61 of 1978 that the appellant can be taken to have
prima facie bona fide claim to the land in dispute which was relevant for the said Land
Encroachment Act, cannot be called in aid as a substitute for lawful entitlement to the land alleged
to be grabbed, which alone is relevant under the Act.

A copy of the statement of Maqta Enquiry (Ext.B-15) which is in Urdu shows that the Maqta was
granted by the Qutub Shahi rulers, which became Sarfekhas property (private property of the
Nizam) subsequently. In the Maqta enquiry the Talukdar (Sarfekhas) recommended that Maqta be
re-granted in favour of Mohd. Abdul Quadir and others (who were ancestors of the lessor of the
appellant). The location of the Maqta (which is referred to as, 'Maqta Naimatullah Shah') was
mentioned as adjacent to Hussain Sagar. Ex.A-20 is a copy of Munthkhab Statement of Inam
Enquiry (Sarfekhas) bearing execution No.1050 dated 09.01.1327 Fasli. It shows that as per the
letter of Administrative Committee of Sarfekhas (Mubark) bearing No.1185 dated 19.09.1326 Fasli,
H.E.H. the Nizam had sanctioned confirmation of cash grant and the Maqta excluding the land
covered by graveyard and the King's bungalow. It is also clear that the land which was appurtenant
to the King's bungalow was returned to Sarfekhas and it was subsequently directed to be sold for
adequate price by H.E.H. the Nizam on 12.02.1343 Fasli. A perusal of Ex.A-26 lends support to the
fact that the original Muntakhab No.1050 of 1327 Fasli of Maqta Naimatullah Shah had excluded the
King's bungalow with the land and the graveyard while sanctioning the confirmation of Maqta by
H.E.H. the Nizam. It appears to us that a palace was constructed during the lifetime of H.E.H. the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 17Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

Nizam VI which was referred to as King's bungalow and which later came to be known as the
Secretariat. The land between the Secretariat and the Hussain Sagar was part of the excluded land
and was lying vacant. It was the land of the Sarfekhas and in regard to that land various persons
including predecessors-in- interest of the appellant made their claims but all the claims were
rejected by the then Sadarul Maham (Minister) of Sarfekhas and it was directed that the land should
be under the control and protection of Babe Hukumat (GAD) and the Revenue Department was
specifically directed to supervise the same. That order was appealed against before Moaziz
Committee of Sarfekhas (comprising of the Chief Justice and two Hon'ble Judges of the High Court
of the then State of Hyderabad). The Committee confirmed the said order of the Minister and
dismissed the appeals on Mehr 30, 1357 Fasli. Thus, it is abundantly clear that Survey Nos.9/15
paiki, 9/16, 9/17, 9/18, 9/19 were not part of Maqta which was reconfirmed in favour of the
predecessors-in-interest of the appellant. They remained land of Sarfekhas (private estate of the
Nizam) which merged in Diwani, that is State Government, on 5.2.1949 (Ex.A-30). It is noted in
Ex.B-20, letter from Tehsil Taluk, Hyderabad West, addressed to the Collector, Hyderabad, dated
27.07.1954 that Survey Nos.9/15, 9/16, 9/17, 9/18 and 9/19 of Maqta Naimatullah Shah are situate
in between the Secretariat and Hussain Sagar Tank. That was also stated to by the appellant in his
deposition. Inasmuch as the Maqta remained under attachment and in the possession of the
Sarfekhas during the period of Inam Enquiry an attempt was made to show that under Ex.B-11, a
letter dated 12.10.1356 Fasli (English translation Ex.B-12), the Maqta was directed to be released in
favour of the Maqtadar. Ex.B-13 a certified copy of the panchnama dated 02.11.1356 Fasli is filed to
show that the land bearing Survey Nos.9/2, 9/10, 9/12, 9/15 and 9/16 to 9/20 measuring 54 acres,
was inspected and while Survey No.9/17 and 9/18 measuring 7 acres and 7 guntas alone were
retained in the Government possession the rest of the Survey numbers were put in possession of the
Inamdar. English translation of Ex.B-13 is marked as Ex.B-14. Ex.B-15 English translation is a
certified copy of receipt dated 02.11.1356 Fasli which was filed to show that possession was taken by
the Maqtadar. These documents were, however, treated by the Special Court as spurious. The said
documents are certified copies and they are in Urdu. A careful reading of Exs.B-11 in Urdu and B-12
(English translation) discloses that the recitals: "Hence the Makhtha may be restored in favour of
Syed Shah Mohd. Wajihullah Hussain Asrari, Makhthedar of the Makhtha Niamathullah Shah and
after release and handing over a detailed compliance report, should be sent along with the receipt"

are out of context with the other recitals therein. Such an important order directing delivery of
possession of land, bearing S.Nos. noted above, which was excluded from regrant of Maqta under
Muntakhab, could not have been directed to be delivered under Ex.B-11. In the ordinary course of
event a decision ought to be taken first and then only it would be communicated. Such a decision
should be in the file. No order was filed in support of Ex.B-11. Further, the subject-matter of the
letter dated 12.10.1356 Fasli (Exs.B-11 and B-12) from the First Talukdar, District Atraf-e-Balda,
Sarfekhas addressed to the Tehsildar, Taluk West shows that the proceeding commenced on the
application for waiving the land revenue on the ground that the land was under attachment and in
the possession of the Government. It is strange to note that in reply to an application to waive the
land revenue the possession of the land was directed to be delivered by the first Taluqdar in his
letter Ex.B-11 dated 12.10.1356 Fasli (English translation Ex.B-12) and purported to have been
delivered under Exs.B-13 and B-14 dated 2nd Mehr 1356 (2.11.1356 Fasli) (wrongly noted in the
English translation as 2.11.1355 Fasli), while the appeal in regard to the land of which the said S.Nos.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 18Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

are a part, was still pending before the Moaziz Committee. From Ex.A-27 it is seen that the Moaziz
Committee decided the appeal on Mehr 30, 1357 (30.11.1357 Fasli) after sending the said letter
(Ex.B
11). These documents are not originals. They are certified copies and, therefore, it is not possible to
make out whether the portion noted above as out of context, really formed part of the letter as in the
absence of the order including the said S.Nos. in the regrant directing delivery of possession, gives
rise to lot of suspicion. We say no more. For the aforementioned reasons, they do not inspire any
confidence to be accepted as correct. In view of these strong reasons we are not persuaded to
disagree with the view of the Special Court that they are spurious documents. Thus, it is clear that
the land in dispute was not part of Maqta land. That land remained as Sarfekhas land and on merger
of Sarfekhas in Diwani on February 5, 1949, it became Government land. Even assuming that it was
part of regranted Inam land, on coming into force of the Inams Act, it vested in the Government.
Admittedly, neither the Inamdar nor the appellant obtained occupancy certificate in respect of the
land in dispute under Inams Abolition Act. In support of the allegations in the petition and the
plaint PW 1 has categorically stated that the appellant is a land grabber and he was not crossexamined on that aspect. We have, therefore, no hesitation in endorsing the finding that the said
Mohd. Nooruddin Asrari had no title to the land in dispute and consequently the appellant acquired
no title to it.

Having regard to the absence of any material on record, all the circumstances and the probabilities
of the case, it is hard to believe that at any time before or on the date of execution of Ex.B-39 the
lessor of the appellant who had no title to or interest in the land which was directed to be under the
supervision of the GAD, was in possession of the land in dispute which was lying vacant.

It is relevant to note that as the decision of the Special Court on the question of title to the land in
dispute was not based on the order of the Collector contained in the letter dated October 5,1959
(Ex.A-14), the validity of that order is inconsequential. We, therefore, do not propose to examine
that aspect. We may note here that the Special Court did not invoke the presumption under Section
10 of the Act against the appellant. It is also evident that the title of the first respondent to the land
in dispute was upheld de hors the weakness in the title of the appellant.

On a careful perusal of the judgment of the Special Court on the question of title of the first
respondent and that of the appellant and his lessor-Inamdar we are satisfied that neither any
relevant material was excluded from consideration nor any irrelevant material was relied upon by
the Special Court in recording its finding. There was, therefore, no scope for the High Court to
interfere with those findings. In our view, the High Court committed no error of law in not
interfering with the findings of the Special Court in regard to the title of the first respondent and
absence of title in the appellant to the land in dispute [See : Omar Salay Mohamed Sait vs.
Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras [AIR 1959 SC 1238]. On the conclusions arrived at by us no
interference is warranted by this Court in this appeal filed under Article 136 of the Constitution of
India. [See : Mehar Singh & Ors. vs. Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee [2000 (2) SCC
97].

To complete the discussion on the lawful entitlement, the appellant's claim of title to the land in
dispute by prescription remains to be examined. The contention of Mr.Parasaran is that the
appellant, who has been in possession of the land since 1954 on the basis of Ext.B-39 (an
unregistered agreement for perpetual lease), perfected his title by adverse possession as on the date
of the suit on November 25, 1985.

Mr.Altaf Ahmad, on the other hand, relied on the conduct of the appellant to show that he had no
requisite animus to possess the land in dispute adverse to the title and interest of the first
respondent and that the essential requirements of adverse possession were not satisfied as neither
the appellant had the requisite animus nor he fulfilled the requirement of possession of the land in
dispute for the statutory period of 30 years; both the Special Court as well as the High Court
concurrently held that the appellant did not perfect his title to the land in dispute by adverse
possession and that finding would not be open to challenge in this appeal.

The Special Court, on the pleadings of the parties, framed issue No.5, noted above. The onus of
proving that issue is on the appellant who claims title by adverse possession. The question of a
person perfecting title by adverse possession is a mixed question of law and fact. The principle of
law in regard to adverse possession is firmly established. It is a well-settled proposition that mere
possession of the land, however long it may be, would not ripe into possessory title unless the
possessor has ‘animus possidendi' to hold the land adverse to the title of the true owner. It is true
that assertion of title to the land in dispute by the possessor would, in an appropriate case, be
sufficient indication of the animus possidendi to hold adverse to the title of the true owner. But such
an assertion of title must be clear and unequivocal though it need not be addressed to the real
owner. For reckoning the statutory period to perfect title by prescription both the possession as well
as the animus possidendi must be shown to exist. Where, however, at the commencement of the
possession there is no animus possidendi, the period for the purpose of reckoning adverse
possession will commence from the date when both the actual possession and assertion of title by
the possessor are shown to exist. The length of possession to perfect title by adverse possession as
against the Government is 30 years.

The appellant (defendant) in his written statement averred that he was claiming title under Mohd.
Nooruddin Asrari who was successor of the original Inamdar Sheik Naimatullah Shah. The land in
dispute is a part of the maqta land which was in his possession from November 28, 1954 under an
agreement for perpetual lease which was confirmed under the registered lease deed executed on
December 11/12, 1957. He alleged that he constructed a small structure in 1955 and thereafter,
having taken due permission, constructed a pucca building. He denied that the said land came in his
possession in 1958 as alleged in the plaint. He stated that he had been in possession adverse to the
plaintiff-the first respondent since November 28, 1954 for more than 30 years prior to the filing of
the suit on November 25, 1985. It is further averred that his predecessor-in-title being in possession
of the said land for innumerable years prior to 1954 in their own right as Inamdar, he is entitled to
tack on their possession to perfect his title by adverse possession.

The first respondent-plaintiff, perhaps with a view to foreclose the plea of adverse possession, stated
in the plaint itself that the possession of the appellant-defendant could not amount to adverse

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 20Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

possession for many reasons; the appellant raised the building with the permission of the court
while O.S.No.13 of 1958 filed by Rasheed Shahpurji Chenoy was pending before the Additional Chief
Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, after giving an undertaking and in view of the undertaking his
possession partakes the character of permissive possession; he paid Siwaijama and applied for
occupancy certificate. The first respondent had instituted eviction proceeding by issuing notice
against the defendant under Section 6 of the Land Encroachment Act.

To appreciate the plea of the first respondent that the appellant's possession of the land in dispute
has the character of permissive possession so he cannot acquire title by adverse possession, it will be
appropriate to refer to the averments in the plaint to understand their true import, which are as
follows :

"The suit lands in the beginning were open and vacant tank bed lands and the defendant raised the
building "Jala Drushyam" with the permission of the Court while O.S.No.13 of 1958 was pending
before the Court of the Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, and the undertaking of
the defendant given in the shape of a bond, while seeking permission to construct the said building,
was to the effect that he would not claim any compensation from the plaintiff for the building raised
on the suit-lands in case the same are ultimately declared and held to be the Government
lands............ The possession of the defendant in view of his undertaking in the above suit partakes
the character of permissive possession and in that view of the matter also the defendant cannot
claim adverse possession against the plaintiff. (emphasis supplied)"

In the concise statement filed along with the application dated March 22, 1992 before the Special
Court the first respondent stated :

"Pending O.S.No.13 of 1958 the respondent herein (the appellant) constructed a building Jala
Drushyam. After the dismissal of the suit. The Government of A.P. initiated eviction proceedings.
The possession of the respondent (the appellant) in view of his undertaking given in the Trial Court
amounts to permissive possession."

From the above averments, it is evident that permission was granted by the court to the appellant to
construct the building 'Jala Drushyam'. Therefore, the said building could be said to be a
construction with permission of the Court and not unauthorised. But certainly the appellant's
possession of the land in dispute, if otherwise adverse to the title of the first respondent, does not
acquire the character of permissive possession on the ground the appellant sought permission of the
Court to erect a building thereon. We are, therefore, of the view that the said averments cannot
come in the way of the appellant in acquiring title by adverse possession if other requirements of
adverse possession are satisfied.

As to the period of the appellant's possession, Mr.Parasaran contended, that though Ex.B-40
perpetual lease agreement was registered on December 12, 1957 yet it would relate back to the date
of Ex.B-39 (28.11.1954) which would be the date of commencement of possession. He sought to
derive support from Thakur Kishan Singh (Dead) vs. Arvind Kumar [1994 (6) SCC 591]. We cannot
accept the submission as a correct proposition of law. In that case the lease deed was executed on

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 21Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

5.12.1949 but it was registered on 30.3.1950. On that factual background this Court held :

"Section 47 of the Registration Act provides that a registered document shall operate from the time
it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made and not
from the time of its registration. It is well established that a document so long it is not registered is
not valid yet once it is registered it takes effect from the date of its execution. (See : Ram Saran Lall
vs. Mst.Domini Kuer [1962 (2) SCR 474 and Nanda Ballabh Gururani vs. Smt.Maqbol Begum [1980
(3) SCC 346]. Since, admittedly, the lease deed was executed on 5.12.1949, the plaintiff after
registration of it on 3.4.1950 became owner by operation of law on the date when the deed was
executed."

In the instant case Ex.B-39 (unregistered perpetual lease agreement dated November 28, 1954) was
not registered subsequently. Ex.B-40 the perpetual lease deed dated 11.12.1957 is a different
document which was registered on 12.12.1957. Therefore, Ex.B-40 would relate back to the date of
its execution i.e. 11.12.1957 on its subsequent registration on 12.12.1957 but not on the date of
execution of Ex.B-39 i.e. 28.11.1954. The Principle laid down in the above case is, therefore, of no
benefit to the appellant.

The Special Court found that the appellant's possession could not be ascribed to the date of the
agreement for lease deed dated 28.11.1954 (Ex.B-39) or registered lease deed dated 11.12.1957
(Ex.B-40) which were excluded from consideration. In regard to Ex.B-39 the Special Court held that
it was a tampered document; the survey numbers of the land leased were given in it as Survey
Nos.9/15 and 9/17 which were altered to appear as Survey Nos.9/15 to 9/18 and the extent of the
land was not mentioned therein. The Special Court noted that in the absence of original of Ext.B-40,
it was not possible to say whether Ex.B-40 also suffered from the same vice of subsequent alteration
in the survey numbers, therefore, it declined to rely on Ex.B-40 also. In view of the criticism of the
Special Court we perused the Urdu documents Ex.B-39 and Ex.B-40. Survey Nos."9/15 and 9/17"
(Ex.B-39) were altered to appear as "9/15 to 9/18". This is visible to the naked eye. The alteration
was not authenticated so the criticism of the Special Court is well-founded. It is also noticed that the
original of Ex.B-40 was not filed in the court and no case is made out to lead secondary evidence.
Further in Exs.B-13 and B-14 (which are discussed above) it is specifically mentioned that
S.Nos.9/17 and 9/18 which were selected for the offices of the Secretariat were retained with the
Government. If that be so, it remained unexplained as to how the appellant obtained the said S.Nos.
on lease from the said Nooruddin. This clearly shows the contradiction in the claim of the appellant
which makes it unacceptable. After excluding the said documents from consideration the Special
Court held that the solitary statement of the appellant that his adverse possession commenced from
November 28, 1954, could not be accepted to hold that he has been in continuous possession for a
period of 30 years as no receipt of payment of rent (nuzul) under the perpetual lease agreement
Ex.B-39 was filed to prove that the appellant has been in possession of the said land from November
28, 1954. The Special Court counted the period of possession of the land in dispute from the date the
appellant obtained permission for construction of the house under Ex.B- 42 dated 09.08.1958 and
the preceding correspondence under Exs.B-60 to B-62 between March, 1958 and August, 1958.
Pointing out that the suit was filed on November 25, 1985, so the period of 30 years was not
completed from 1958, it rejected the plea of adverse possession.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 22Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

In regard to the animus of the appellant to possess the land in dispute adverse to the interest of the
first respondent, the Special Court pointed out that the appellant applied for occupancy certificate to
the concerned authority under the Inams Abolition Act which nullified the animus of adverse
possession. The Special Court also relied on Ex.A-42 (Ex.B
43) issued by the State demanding siwai jamabandi on May 14, 1960 and payment of the same
under Exs.A-44 and A-45 dated June 30, 1960 to show that the requisite animus was lacking. These
documents were put to the appellant when he was in the witness box and he admitted the same. On
the basis of the above evidence the Special Court came to the conclusion that the appellant failed to
prove adverse possession. In the said writ petition the High Court did not find any illegality in the
approach or decision of the Special Court and declined to interfere with the said finding.

We have already noted above the requirements of adverse possession.
In Balkrishan Vs. Satyaprakash & Ors. (J.T. 2001 (2) SC 357), this Court held :

"The law with regard to perfecting title by adverse possession is well settled. A person claiming title
by adverse possession has to prove three "nec" - nec vi, nec clam and nec precario. In other words,
he must show that his possession is adequate in continuity in publicity and in extent. In S.M. Karim
v. Mst. Bibi Sakina (AIR 1964 SC 1254) speaking for this Court, Hidayatullah, J. (as he then was)
observed thus :

"Adverse possession must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and extent and a plea is required at
the least to show when possession becomes adverse so that the starting point of limitation against
the party affected can be found."

In that case the requirement of animus possidendi was not adverted to as on facts it was shown to be
present; the controversy, however, was about the other ingredient of adverse possession. It is clear
that it must be shown by the person claiming title by prescription that he has been in possession of
the land for the statutory period which is adequate in continuity in publicity and in extent with the
animus of holding the land adverse to the true owner.

Mr.Parasaran, however, contended and reiterated in his written submissions that possession in
assertion of one's own title was animus of adverse possession and that passing an adverse order
against the appellant or the appellant himself filing an application to any statutory authorities for
occupancy certificate would not interrupt his adverse possession of the land in dispute. It was also
contended that as a derivative title holder he was entitled to tack his possession to that of his
predecessor-in-interest and that in any event the presumption of the continuity of state of things
backwards could also be drawn as the appellant's possession from 1958 was accepted and the
possession earlier to 1958 should also be presumed.

Regarding the animus of the appellant, admittedly he claimed as a lessee under the Inamdar. Indeed
in his written statement filed in Rasheed Shahpurji Chenoy'suit (O.S.No.13 of 1958 on the file of
Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad) he claimed to be a lessee under the Inamdar.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 23Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

He, however, did not assert title to the land in dispute in himself nor did he lay any claim on the
ground of adverse possession. Even otherwise there is no material to show that between November
28, 1954 (unregistered perpetual lease agreement, assuming it to be free from interpolation and
admissible as agreement for lease and (Ex.B-40) registered lease deed dated December 11, 1957
(assuming that the secondary evidence is admissible) and the date of filing of the written statement
on January 28, 1987 the appellant claimed title to the land in dispute otherwise than under Ex.B-40
much less by way of asserting adverse title. It is only in the written statement filed in the present suit
that he pleaded adverse possession for the first time. The possession of the said land from the date
of Ex.B-39, 1954, till the date of the filing of the written statement in 1987 cannot, therefore, be
treated as adverse because there was no animus possidendi during the said period. Before the date
of filing the written statement he never claimed title to the land in dispute adverse to the State. On
the other hand, he paid siwai jamabandi and applied for occupation of rights. Indeed in his
deposition as R.W.1 in chief examination before the Special Court he stated, "on being satisfied
about the nature of the Inam, I entered into an agreement of perpetual lease on 28.11.1954 with
Inamdar as per Ex.B-39............0.. I have taken possession from the Maqtedar under Ex.B-39 on
28-11-1954. Since then I am in occupation uninterruptedly and enjoying the same."

We found no assertion of title by adverse possession in his deposition. Further there is nothing on
record to show that his lessor, Mohd. Nooruddin Asrari, ever claimed the land in dispute adverse to
the State. On these facts there is no scope to invoke the principle of tacking the possession of the
Inamdar or presumption of continuity of possession backward.

There can be no doubt that passing of adverse order against the appellant would not cause any
interruption in his possession [See : Balkrishan vs. Satyaprakash (supra)]. So also filing of
application before statutory authority under Inams Abolition Act for occupancy rights, in our view,
causes no interruption in the continuity of possession of the appellant but it does abrogate his
animus to hold the land in derogation of the title of the state and breaks the chain of continuity of
the animus.

In the light of the above discussion we hold that the appellant neither proved factum of possession
of the land in dispute for period of 30 years nor succeeded in showing that he had animus
possidendi for the whole statutory period. Therefore, we cannot but maintain the confirming view of
the High Court that the appellant failed to acquire title to the land in dispute by adverse possession.
We may also add that the lessee of a Maqtedar (the Inamdar) cannot acquire title to the demised
land by adverse possession either as against the State or the Maqtedar (Inamdar) so long as his
possession under the lease continues.

Mr.Parasaran has contended that should the point of adverse possession be found against the
appellant, the principle of lost grant would apply as the appellant has been in possession of the land
in dispute for a considerable length of time under an assertion of title. In support of his contention
he placed reliance on Monohar Das Mohanta Vs. Charu Chandra Pal and Ors. (A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 228).

The principle of lost grant is a presumption which arises in cases of immemorial user. It has its
origin from the long possession and exercise of right by user of an easement with the acquiescence

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 24Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

of the owner that there must have been originally a grant to the claimant which had been lost. The
presumption of lost grant was extended in favour of possessor of land for a considerably long period
when such user is found to be in open assertion of title, exclusive and uninterrupted. However, when
the use is explainable, the presumption cannot be called in aid. A constitution Bench of this Court
explained the principle in Monohar Das Mohanta (supra) thus, "The circumstances and conditions
under which a presumption of lost grant could be made are well settled. When a person was found
in possession and enjoyment of land for a considerable period of time under an assertion of title
without challenge, Courts in England were inclined to ascribe a legal origin to such possession, and
when on the facts a title by prescription could not be sustained, it was held that a presumption could
be made that the possession was referable to a grant by the owner entitled to the land, but that such
grant had been lost. It was a presumption made for securing ancient and continued possession,
which could not otherwise be reasonably accounted for. But it was not a ‘presumptio juris et de jure’.
A presumptio juris et de jure, means an irrebuttable presumption, is one which the law will not
suffer to be rebutted by any counter-evidence, but establishes as conclusive; whereas a presumption
juris tantum is one which holds good in the absence of evidence to the contrary, but may be
rebutted. [Juris et de jure - Of law and of right] and the Courts were not found to raise it, if the facts
in evidence went against it.

"It cannot be the duty of a judge to presume a grant of the non-existence of which he is convinced"
observed Farwell, J. in - 'Attorney- General Vs. Simpson’, 1901-2 Ch.671 at p.698 (A)."

[para 7 page 230] In that case the possession of the defendant was claimed to be for over 200 years
but there was no finding on the length of possession. On the ground, inter alia, that the land was
part of Mal lands (assessed land) within the zamindari, it was held that there was no scope for
applying presumption of lost grant. In the case on hand the appellant traces his possession from
1954 under an unregistered perpetual lease from the erstwhile Inamdar (Maqtedar). Therefore, the
presumption of lost grant will not be available to the appellant.

Thus, it follows that the appellant has unauthorisedly come into possession of the land in dispute of
the first respondent without lawful entitlement.

Now reverting to the other ingredient of the definition of the expression 'land grabbing’ -- intention
of the appellant - embodied in the phrase "with a view to" illegally taking possession of the land in
dispute or entering into the land for any of the purposes mentioned in clause (e) of Section 2, the
Special Court discussed exhaustively both the documentary evidence on record and the oral
evidence of the appellant under the caption - design of the first appellant in obtaining the
documents of title and resisting possession -- and concluded that he was fully aware of the infirmity
of the title of his vendor for want of confirmation of the grant by the civil administrator and
subsequent mutation proceedings, willingly suffered siwai jama assessment, paid the same and
raised structures when a suit was pending and therefore he was a land grabber. The High Court
having noted the discussion of the Special Court on the said issue and having adverted to the
evidence, declined to interfere with that finding in the writ petition.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 25Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

The requisite intention which is an important ingredient of the land grabber, though not stated
specifically, can be inferred by necessary implication from the averments in the petition and the
plaint and the deposition of witness like any other fact. If a person comes into occupation of any
Government land under the guise of a perpetual lease executed by an unauthorised person having
no title to or interest in the land it cannot but be with a view to illegally taking possession of such
land. We make it clear that we are expressing no opinion on the point whether those averments
would constitute 'mensrea' for purposes of offence under the Act.

We have carefully gone through the concise statement accompanying the application filed by the
first respondent before the Special Court on March 20, 1992 and the plaint in O.S.No.1497 of 1985
filed by the first respondent in the Court of the IV Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad. It
is also averred that the appellant occupied the land in dispute in the year 1958 and raised building
"Jala Drushyam" and on coming to know of it the first respondent took action for his eviction under
Section 6 of the Land Encroachment Act. It is also stated that the claim of the appellant to the land
in dispute is not proper, valid or legal as it never belonged to Naimatullah Shah Maqta and even
otherwise the land ceased to be Inam land from July 20, 1955 and had vested in the first respondent
and none of the heirs of Naimatullah Shah had come forward to be declared as occupant under the
Inam Abolition Act. The land in dispute is described by the first respondent as land grabbed and a
declaration is sought from the Special Court that the appellant is a land grabber.

It may be observed here that though it may be apt yet it is not necessary for any petitioner who
invokes the jurisdiction of the Special Court/Special Tribunal to use in his petition under Sections
7(1) and 8(1) of the Act, the actual words employed in the relevant provisions of the Act, namely,
grabbing of the land without any lawful entitlement and with a view to or with the intention of (a)
illegally taking possession of such lands or (b) enter into or create illegal tenancies, leases or licences
agreements or any other illegal agreements in respect of such lands; or (c) to construct unauthorised
structures thereon for sale or hire; or (d) to give such lands to any person on (i) rental or (ii) lease
and licence basis for construction, or (iii) use and occupation of unauthorised structures, as the case
may be. Prima facie it will satisfy the requirements of the Act if the petitioner alleges that the
respondent is a land grabber or that he has grabbed the land. What is pertinent is that the
allegations in the petition/plaint, in whatever language made, should make out the ingredients of
land grabbing against such a person or his being a land grabber within the meaning of those
expressions under the Act, as explained above. It is only when the allegations made in the
petition/plaint are proved the activity of taking possession of the land will fall within the meaning of
land grabbing that such a possessor can be termed as a "land grabber" within the meaning of that
expression under the Act.

It is generally true that in the absence of necessary pleadings in regard to the ingredients of the
definition of "land grabbing" no finding can validly be recorded on the basis of the evidence even if
such evidence is brought on record. Mr. Parasaran cited the judgment of this Court in Sri
Venkataramana Devaru & Ors. vs. The State of Mysore & Ors. (1958 SCR 895 at 906) to support his
submission that without necessary pleading, the evidence on record cannot be looked into.
However, it is a settled position that if the parties have understood the pleadings of each other
correctly, an issue was also framed by the Court, the parties led evidence in support of their

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 26Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

respective cases, then the absence of a specific plea would make no difference. In Nedunuri
Kameswaramma vs. Sampati Subba Rao [1963 (2) SCR 208], Hidayatullah,J. (as he then was)
speaking for a three-Judge Bench of this Court observed at page No.214 thus :

"Though the appellant had not mentioned a Karnikam service inam, parties well understood that the
two cases opposed to each other were of Dharmila Sarvadumbala inam as against a Karnikam
service inam. The evidence which has been led in the case clearly showed that the respondent
attempted to prove that this was a Dharmila inam and to refute that this was a Karnikam service
inam. No doubt, no issue was framed, and the one, which was framed, could have been more
elaborate; but since the parties went to trial fully knowing the rival case and led all the evidence not
only in support of their contentions but in refutation of those of the other side, it cannot be said that
the absence of an issue was fatal to the case, or that there was that mis- trial which vitiates
proceedings."

The same view is expressed by this Court in the following two cases : Kali Prasad (Dead) by Lrs. &
Ors. vs. M/s.Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. & Ors. [1989 Supl. (1) SCC 628] and Sardul Singh vs. Pritam
Singh & Ors. [1999 (3) SCC 522].

Now, in the instant case the appellant has never pleaded before the Special Court that necessary
pleading in regard to the requirements of land grabbing is lacking in the case. On the other hand, he
understood the averments in the petition read with the plaint correctly as allegations of land
grabbing as can be seen from the affidavit containing objections to the Gazette Notification dated
April 1, 1992, referred to above, filed on April 16, 1992 (affidavit was attested on April 10, 1992). He
stated "I deny the petitioner's allegation of land grabbing whatsoever, made in its petition dated
20.3.1992". He further stated that the documents filed by him and the first respondent "nullify the
petitioners allegation of land grabbing, claim of title over the land and claim of right to get the
possession of the land and the building.....". On this pleading the Special Court framed issue No.6
aforementioned. The parties adduced evidence, oral and documentary, on that issue. We have
already discussed documentary evidence above. PW 1 in his statement categorically stated that the
appellant was a land grabber. What is surprising to note is that there was no cross- examination on
that aspect. What is more surprising is that in his deposition he did not even state that he was not a
land grabber and the land in dispute was not a grabbed land. We have not taken this as his
admission but only an aspect in appreciation of oral evidence.

The Special Court is, therefore, correct in discussing the evidence on record under the caption
‘design’ in view of the pleading on that aspect, adverted to above and the High Court rightly upheld
the same. We have already pointed out that the activity of grabbing of any land should not only be
without any lawful entitlement but should also be, inter alia, with a view to illegally taking
possession of such lands. These two ingredients are found against the appellant.

It is nonetheless submitted by Mr.Parasaran that the plaint mentions that the possession of the
appellant partakes the character of permissive possession and this averment negates the very
concept of land grabbing. It is no doubt true that if the possession is permissive then it cannot be
treated as illegal for purposes of clauses (d) and (e) of sub-section (2) of the Act. We have already

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768336/ 27Konda Lakshmana Bapuji vs Govt. Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors on 29 January, 2002

discussed above with regard to the alleged plea of permissive possession and held that those
averments in the plaint would not constitute plea of ‘permissive possession’. In the light of the above
discussion, we have no option but to sustain the view of the High Court in approving the finding of
the Special Court on Issue No.6, that the appellant falls within the mischief of the definition of the
expression "land grabber" under the Act.

In the result, we uphold the judgment and order of the High Court under challenge declining to
interfere with the judgment and decree of the Special Court. The appeal is dismissed; the parties
shall bear their own costs.

HEADNOTE:

The petitioner in each of the three writ petitions who
was to be tried by general court martial for breach of army
discipline questioned the legality and validity of the order
convening the general court martial, more particularly its
Composition.

In their petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution it
was contended on behalf of the petitioners that to satisfy
the requirements of Article 33 the law must be a specific
law enacted by Parliament in which a _ specific provision
imposing restriction or even abrogation of fundamental
rights should be made; (2) that rule 40 of the Rules should
be so construed as to subserve the mandate of Article 21
that the Army with its total commitment to national security
against foreign invasion must be assured the prized liberty
of individual members against unjust encroachment and the
court should strike a just balance between military
discipline and individual personal liberty; and (3) that
principles of natural justice should be observed even in
respect of persons tried by the Army Tribunals.

Dismissing the petitions,

HELD: The dominant purpose in construing a statute is
to ascertain the intention of Parliament. One of the well
recognised canons of construction is that the legislature
speaks its mind by use of correct expression and unless
there is any ambiguity in the language of the provision, the
Court should adopt literal construction if it does not lead
to an absurdity. To ascertain the literal
394
meaning it is equally necessary first to ascertain the
juxtaposition in which the rule is placed, the Purpose for
which it is enacted and the object which it is required to
subserve and the authority by which the rule is framed.

[404 F-H; 405 A-B]

Article 33 of the Constitution which confers power on
Parliament to determine to what extent any of the rights
conferred by Part III shall in their application to the
members of armed forces be restricted or abrogated does not
obligate that Parliament must specifically adumbrate each
fundamental right and specify in the law the degree of
restriction or total abrogation of each right. That would be
reading into Art. 33 a requirement which it does not enjoin.
The power to legislate in respect of any item must be
referable to any entry in the relevant legislative list. The
law has to be enacted by Parliament subject to the
requirement of Part III read with Art. 33 which itself forms
part of Part III. Therefore if any provision of the Army Act
is in conflict with fundamental rights it shall have to be
read subject to Art. 33 as being enacted with a_ view to
either restricting or abrogating the fundamental rights to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

the extent of inconsistency or repugnancy between Part III
and the Army Act. [412 E-H]

Ram Sarup v. Union of India & Another [1964] 5 SCR 931:
referred to.

Section 21 of the Army Act merely confers an additional
power to modify rights conferred by Art. 19(1)(a) and (c) by
rules and such rules may set out the limits of restriction.
But the specific provision does not derogate from the
generality of power conferred by Art. 33. Therefore, it is
not possible to accept the contention that the law
prescribing procedure for trial of offences by Court Martial

must satisfy the requirement of Art. 21 because to the
extent the procedure is prescribed by law. and if it stands
in derogation of Art. 21 to that extent, Art. 21 in its

application to the Armed forces is modified by enactment of
the procedure in the Army Act itself. [413 E-G]

Dalbir Singh v. State of Punjab [1962] Suppl. 3 SCR 25:
held inapplicable.

Rule 40 which deals with composition of the court
martial enjoins both a positive and negative requirement:
positively that it shall be composed or officers of
different corps or departments and negatively that it shall
not be com posed exclusively of officers of the corps or the
department to which the delinquent belongs. Both these
requirements are subject to the overriding consideration
that one or the other requirement could be given a go-bye if
it is otherwise found not to be practicable. [418 A-C]

The expression “Army corps" does not carry the same
Meaning as ‘corps'. The two expressions carry different
connotations. Both connote a distinct and different unit in
the army. Corps forms a small part of what is called "army
corps". [420 D]

The Indian army is divided into commands and each
command is divided into army corps. Corps in this sense
means an army formation. Each army corps is composed of
divisions, each division is divided into brigades, each
brigade into battalions and each battalion into companies.
There may be an unattached
395
company not forming part of a battalion and may be
independent of any battalion. Rule 187 (3) (b) treats such
unattached company not forming part of a battalion as a
crops by itself. In other words, every company is part of
some battalion because each battalion is sub-divided into
companies and that is possibly the army unit which is being
designated as crops. Bearing in mind the designation of
battalion in infantry and regiment in cavalry, the unit
designated as battalion or regiment will be a crops for the
purpose of the Act and the Rules. This conclusion is
reinforced by reference to rule 187 (1) in which there are
separate bodies of persons each by its very designation,
duties and responsibilities, and functional requirements
would not be part hf regular army battalion and, therefore,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

each has to be designated as a corps for the purpose of the
Act and the rules: [419 H]

If various army crops’ from part of the command and if
for setting up a general court martial in strict compliance
with r.40 is to be insisted upon, persons’ from different
army corps have to be selected. But the inhibition of rule
40 will present an insurmountable difficulty in that any
such general court martial shall not be composed exclusively
of officers of the same corps. What is positively desired is
that for the composition of a general court-martial one must
strive to secure services of officers of different corps or
departments and what must be eschewed is its being composed
exclusively cf officers of the corps or departments to which
the delinquent officer belongs. If a restricted meaning is
given to the expression ‘corps the rule becomes workable. If
on the other hand a wider meaning is given so as to
substitute “army corps" for "corps" it would be wholly
unworkable because officers will have to be summoned from
another command altogether. A vertical movement starting
from the bottom which is indicated by reference to battalion
and regiment in r. 187 (3) clearly indicates that the lowest
formation in the battalion or regiment is corps over and
above those specifically designated as corps under r.
187(1). Therefore, the expression 'corps' in rule 40 must be
given the same meaning as set out in rule 187(3) and it
would mean that every battalion in the infantry and every
regiment in the cavalry would by itself be a corps. [421 DH; 422 A-D]

To put the personnel of the general court-martial
beyond reproach and to make it unbiased and objective
composition of the court-martial was so devised by statutory
rules as to make it an ideal body having all the trappings
of a court. People drawn from different corps, and avoiding
officers of the same corps composing the general court
martial, would ensure an objective unbiased body. This is
achieved by giving the expression "corps" a_ restricted
meaning so as not to make it synonymous with Army Corps at
the top. If a battalion or a regiment is treated as a
‘corps' then it is easy to provide composition of court
Martial in strict compliance with rule 40. Viewed from
either angle the expression '‘corps' in rule 40 is not used
in the same sense in which the expression ‘army corps' is
used. It is used in the sense in which it is defined and
elaborated in rule 187.

[422 E-H; 423 A D]

It is, of course, true that the interpretation of rule
40 must be informed by the underlying intendment that
officers composing the court martial must be independent of
command influence or influence of superior officers like the
396
convening officer. This depends on what meaning one must
assign to a loose expression like ‘command influence' and
‘influence of superior officers'. These expression have to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

be understood in the context of the vertical hierarchy in
the composition of army. Once it transpires that the
expression ‘corps' in rule 40 has the same meaning as has
been set out in rule 187 and, therefore the battalion would
be a corps and an unattached company can bea corps by
itself, it becomes easy and practicable to set up a courtMartial in which officers outside the corps to which an
accused belongs are enlisted and it could certainly be said
to be free from command influence. [423 E-H]

Rule 40 by its very language is not mandatory. This
rule on its own force insists on compliance with its
requirements as far as may be practicable. Even with this
leeway, a strict compliance with the requirements of rule 40
must be insisted upon and the departure on the ground of
practicability will, if challenged, have to be proved within
the broad parameters of functional adjustability of the army
requirement. Therefore, the expression ‘corps in rule 40 is
not synonymous with the expression ‘army corps'. It must
receive a restricted construction with narrow connotation as
explained in rule 187 (3). [424 C-F]

Two other requirement which should be complied with
while setting up a general court martial are (i) that a
general court-martial shall consist of not less than five
officers, each of whom has held a commission for not less
than three whole years and of whom not less than four are of
the rank not below that of a Captain and (ii) that members
of court martial for trial of an officer shall be of a rank
not lower than that of the delinquent officer unless in the
opinion of the convening officer, officers of such rank are
not available. Sub-rule (3) of rule 40 merely incorporates
the mandate of section 113. [424 F-H]

In the instant case the general court-martial set up to
try the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 4903181 consisted of
five officers one of whom was of a higher rank and the
others were of coordinate or of equal rank. Even though all
of them belonged to the 9th Infantry Division they were
drawn from different brigades and regiments and none of them
belonged to the same corps to which the petitioner belonged
and none was lower in rank than the rank held by the petitioner. Therefore the requirement of rule 40 was strictly
complied with.

[425 B-E]

In the case of the petitioner in Writ Petition No.
1513/79 the general court martial was composed of seven
officers, each of whom held a rank higher than the
petitioner was none of them belonged to the corps to which
he belonged. There was therefore no violation of rule 40.
[425 F-H]

The petitioner in Writ Petition No. 5930/80 belonged to
the 33 Army Corps. None of the officers composing the
general court-martial belonged to his corps nor was any of
them lower in rank than a Captain. Therefore. there was
nothing to show that rule 40 had been violated. [426 A-C]

When either a general, district or summary courtmartial is assembled and the accused is brought before it,
section 1 30 enjoins that the names of the
397
presiding officer and the members composing the court
martial be read out and the accused be asked whether he
objects to his being tried by any of the officers sitting on
the court. If the accused objects to any such officer being
present his objection and reply of the officer objected to
shall be heard and recorded and the remaining officers of
the court shall in the absence of the challenged officer
decide the objection. This provision is elaborated in rules
41 to 44. In order to ensure that any one objected to does
not participate in disposing of the objection, clause (a) of
the proviso to rule 44 directs that the accused should state
the names of all officers constituting the court in respect
of whom he_ has any objection. This is a _ mandatory
requirement because the officer objected to cannot
participate in the decision disposing of the objection. It
is true that if a court is not constituted in accordance
with the Act and the Rules, rule 44 would hardly assist
because as in such a case if the contention is that rule 40
was violated there is none left to dispose of the
contention, because once such an objection is taken no one
shall be competent to decide the objection. The provision
conferring the right on the accused to object to a member of
the court-martial sitting as a member and participating in
the trial ensure that a charge of bias could be made and
investigated against individual members composing the courtMartial. This is a pre-eminently rational provision for
ensuring a fair trial. In the present case however there was
no allegation of bias against any individual member of the
court-martial.

[426 D-H; 427 A-F]

Rules 22 to 24 are mandatory in respect of every person
subject to the Act other than officers. That the
requirements of these rules are not mandatory in the case of
an officer, becomes manifestly clear from rule 25(1) which
provides that where an officer is charged with an offence
under the Act the investigation shall if he requires it be
held and the evidence if he so requires it be taken in his
presence in writing in the same manner as nearly as
circumstances admit as is required by rules 22 and 23 in the
case of other persons subject to the Act.

[432 B-C]

The petitioner in this case being an officer, the
procedure prescribed in rules 22 and 23 would not apply
proprio vigore to him. If he wanted compliance with rules it
was for him to have made a request that the investigation be
done in his presence and that the summary of evidence be
drawn in his presence. Nowhere in the petition did the
petitioner specifically state that he did make such a
request. In the absence of such a request failure to comply

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

with rules 22 to 24 would not vitiate the trial by the
general court martial. [432 D-E; 433 A-C]

Rex v. Thomson [1946] 4 Dominion Law Reports 579, held
inapplicable.

There is no force in the argument that to the extent
that the application of principles of natural justice
enacted in rules 22 to 24 is made dependent on the demand by
the officer concerned, compliance with rules of natural
justice must be deemed to be an integral part of the
procedure prescribed for a tribunal whose decision is likely
to result in deprivation of personal liberty. Parliament has
the power to restrict or abrogate any of the rights
conferred by Part III in their application to members of the
Armed Force so as_ to ensure proper discharge of duties and
maintenance of discipline amongst them. The Army Act is one
398
such law. Therefore none of the ‘provisions of the Act can
be struck down on the only ground that they restrict or
abrogate or tend to restrict or abrogate any of the rights
conferred by Part III which include Art. 21.
procedure established by law prescribes compliance with
principles of natural justice but makes it dependent upon a
requisition by the person against whom an inquiry has to be
held such procedure would not be violative of Art. 21. [434
B-E]

In the instant case the rules have made a clear
distinction between an officer governed by the Act and any
other person subject to the Act. The accused was a person
belonging to the upper bracket in the Armed Forces. Although
in respect of persons belonging to the lower category rules
22 to 24 are mandatory, in respect of persons belonging to
the upper bracket the necessary presumption is that he is a
highly educated knowledgeable intelligent person and
compliance with these rules is not obligatory. But the rules
have to be complied with if the officer so requires it. This
is quite rational and understandable. An officer cannot be
heard to say that he would not insist upon an inquiry in
which he would Participate and then turn round and contend
that failure to hold the inquiry in accordance with the
principles of natural justice would invalidate the inquiry.

Rules 22, 23 and 24 prescribe participation at a stage
prior to the trial by the court martial. In a trial which is
likely to result in deprivation of liberty the body which
has ultimately the power to make an order which would result
in deprivation of liberty must hear the offender offering
full participation. How ever, the procedure prescribed by
these rules is at a stage anterior to the trial by the
court-martial. It is the decision of the court martial which

There is therefore no substance in the contention that rules
22, 23 and 24 in view of the provision contained in rule 25,
are ultra vires Art. 21 of the Constitution. As failure to
comply with the requirements of rules 22, 23 and 24 depended
upon a_ requisition by the petitioner, his inaction or
omission in that behalf would have no impact on the order
convening the court martial. [435G-H: 436A-C]

Rule 180 cannot be construed to mean that whenever or
wherever in any enquiry in respect of any person subject to
the Act his character or military reputation is likely to be
affected, setting up of the court of enquity is sine qua
non. By its very nature the court of enquiry is likely to
examine certain issues concerning a situation or persons and
in the course of such enquiry there may be a _ distinct
possibility of character or military reputation of a person
subject to the Act being affected. To ensure That such
person should be afforded full opportunity to participate,
rule 180 merely makes an enabling provision to ensure his
participation. It cannot be used to say that whenever in any
other enquiry or an enquiry before the commanding officer
under rule 22 or a convening officer under
399
rule 37. of the trial by the court-martial in which the
character or military reputation of the officer concerned is
likely to be affected, a prior enquiry by the court of
enquiry is a sine qua non. [439 G-H; 440 A-D]

Absence of even one appeal with power to review
evidence, legal formulation, conclusion and adequacy or
otherwise of punishment is a glaring iacuna in a country
where a counterpart civilian convict can prefer appeal after
appeal to hierarchy of courts. The time has come when a step
is required to be taken for at least one review and it must
truly be a judicial review as and by way of appeal to a body
composed of non-military personnel or civil personnel.

each petitioner convening General Court Martial to try each petitioner in respect of the charges
framed against each of them is questioned on diverse grounds but principally the composition in
each of these petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution. In Writ Petition No. 4903/81 the
petitioner has also challenged the constitutional validity of rules 22, 23, 2S and 40 of the Army
Rules, 1954 (‘Rules' for short) as being violative of the fundamental rights of the petitioner
guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. As certain contentions were common to all
the three petitions they were heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment
Facts alleged on which legal formulations were founded may be briefly set out in respect of each
petitioner.

Re: Writ Petition No. 4903/81:

Petitioner Lt. Col. Prithipal Singh Bedi was granted permanent regular commission in the Regiment
of Artillery in 1958 and in course of his service he came to be promoted as Captain, then as Major
and at the relevant time he was holding the rank of Lt. Colonel and in that capacity he was
designated as Commanding officer, 226, Medium Regiment of 43 Artillery Brigade. As part of his
duty he had to write interim confidential reports of five officers of the rank of Major subordinate to
him. One Major R. S. Sehgal was one of the subordinate officers whose interim confidential report
was written by the petitioner. Under the relevant rules the officer whose confidential report is
written by his superior has to be shown the confidential report and in token of his having seen the
same his signature is to be obtained, the purpose underlying this procedure being that the attention
of the subordinate officer is drawn to the counselling remark in the confidential report which may
encourage him to remedy the defect pointed out and to improve in his efficiency. The confidential
reports prepared by the petitioner were to be reviewed by the Brigadier. It is alleged that Brig. N.
Sondhi, AVSM who held the office of the Brigadier and under whom the petitioner was working as
Lt. Colonel at the time of writing reports had already been transferred on January 8, 1980 and
therefore, the confidential reports submitted by the petitioner were required to be reviewed by the
officer who occupied the of office of Brigadier consequent upon the transfer of Brig. N. Sondhi. It is
admitted that petitioner had also received his order of transfer dated February 6, 1980 but he left
the charge on February 26, 1980, after completing the formality of handing over charge and also
writing the interim confidential reports which he was bound to complete before proceeding on
transfer. It is alleged that Major R.S. Sehgal in respect of whom petitioner wrote the confidential
report on February 20, 1980, Which contained a counselling remark adverse to the officer was a
near relation of Brig. N. Sondhi. It is further alleged that even though Brig. Sondhi had already been
transferred and had left charge, yet on February 25,1980, the confidential reports were forwarded by
the Headquarters 43 Artillery Brigade to Brig. Sondhi for reviewing the same. While so A reviewing
the confidential reports, Brig. Sondhi addressed a query with respect to the last sentence in para 27

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 9Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

in the confidential report of Major Sehgal; "that the last sentence appears to have been written
possibly at a different time. It is suggested that a confirmation may be asked for from the officer as
to whether he was aware of the complete para prior to signing. The ICR may thereafter be returned
for onward despatch". Suspicion underlying this query is that adverse entry reflected in the last
sentence of para 27 was interpolated after the confiential report was signed by Major Sehgal. The
suspicion arose on the visual impression that: (a) there is change in ink of last line;

(b) last line appears to have been written over the signature of the officer reported upon; (c) size of
lettering of the last line is smaller than the rest of the para. It may be - mentioned that ultimately
this alleged interpolation in the interim confidential report after the same having been initialled by
the officer reported upon is the gravamen of the charge under section 45 of the Army Act on which
the petitioner is called upon to face a' trial by the General Court Martial convened under the
impugned order dated April 11, 1981.

Re: Writ Petition No. 1513/79:

The first petitioner Captain Dharampal Kukrety and Petitioner 2 Naik Bhanwar Singh were both
attached at the relevant time to 2 Rajput Regiment but since the order to try them before a General
Court Martial both of them are attached to 237 Engineer Regiment of 25 Infantry Division which is a
part of the 16th Corps of the Indian Army. Petitioner 1 was promoted as Acting Major but because of
the direction to try him before a Court material he has been reverted to the substantive rank of
Captain. Petitioner 2 holds the substantive rank of Naik. In the year 1978 one Lt. Col. S. N. Verma
was the Commanding officer of the 2 Rajput Regiment and the 1st petition was directly under him
being second in command. One Major V.K. Singh belonging to the 2 Rajput Regiment was a
Company Commander under Lt. Col. Verma. He applied for casual leave for seven days and Lt. Col
Verma granted the same. In the meantime on October 14, 1978, Lt. Col. Verma proceeded on leave.
First petitioner being the second in command was officiating Commanding officer when Lt. Col.
Verma proceeded on leave. On October 16, 1978, the ist petitioner informed Major V.K. Singh that
he could proceed on leave with effect from October, 17, 1978, for a period of seven days. Major V.K.
Singh, however, overstayed his leave and returned after 10 days. Petitioner contends that he being a
strict disciplinarian, he did not approve of the default of Major Singh and, therefore, he reported the
matter to Lt. Col. Verma on his return from leave who in turn asked the ist petitioner to make
investigation and submit report. On the ist petitioner making the report, Lt. Col. S.N. Verma
ordered abstract of evidence to be recorded by framing some charge against Major V.K. Singh. The
allegation is that the father-in-law of Major V.K. Singh is Deputy Speaker of Haryana State
Legislative Assembly and a man of powerful political influence who appears to have contacted third
respondent Lt. General Gurbachan Singh to assist his son-in-law Major V.K. Singh. It is alleged that
when Major V.K. Singh was produced before 7th respondent Brigadier P.N. Kacker, the latter
appeared reluctant to proceed against Major V.K. Singh. First petitioner sought an interview with
7th respondent and insisted that disciplinary action should be initiated against Major V.K. Singh.
First petitioner sought an interview with 5th respondent on December 16, 1978. Major V.K. Singh
was awarded ‘displeasure’ which appears to have infuriated the first petitioner because according to
him punishment was disproportionately low compared to default. It is alleged that 5th respondent
suggested that ist petitioner be put on AFMS-10 for psychiatric investigation. ist petitioner sought

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 10Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

attachment to other unit, certain very untoward incidents followed which are detailed in the report
of Court of Inquiry set up for ascertaining the facts which are not necessary to be detailed here. Ist
petitioner has set out in his petition chronology of events leading to his being charge-sheeted.
Ultimately, an order was made to try him by a General Court Martial and a General Court Martial
was convened as per the order dated October 7, 1979. The legality and validity of the order
constituting the General Court Martial is impugned in this petition. Re: Writ Petition No. 5930/80
Petitioner Captain Chander Kumar Chopra joined the Army as 2nd Lieutenant on January 12, 1969,
and in course of time came to be promoted as Captain and at the relevant time he belonged to - 877
At BN. ASC under 20 Mountain Division which is one of the Divisions in 33 Corps. Petitioner was
second-in-command. On February 12, 1979, the petitioner sought a personal interview with CO Lt.
Col. R.M. Bajaj to report against Major S.K. Malhotra for the irregularities committed in the
Company disclosing misappropriation of funds, pilferage of petrol and stores, furnishing of false
information and certificates in official documents resulting in loss to the State, misuse of transport
and misuse of power and property. As Lt. Col. Bajaj did not possibly take any action on this report,
the petitioner on March 7, 1979, submitted an application to the Chief of Staff, Headquarters, 33
Corps c/o 99 APO to bring to the notice of Chief of Staff the irregularities going on in 'A' Coy. 877 AT
BN ASC and seeking an interview at an early date. The petitioner's request for a personal interview
was turned down whereupon the petitioner made an application for casual leave for 13 days w.e.f.
February 26, 1979, which appears not to have been granted. On March 16, 1979, the petitioner was
summoned by Lt. Col. Bajaj at his residence and he was assured that justice would be done but the
petitioner should cancel the letter dated March 7, 1979, and surrender the demi official letter
addressed to Coy. 33 Corps in the interest and name of the Unit. Thereafter the petitioner was taken
to office by Lt. Col. Bajaj and it is alleged that under pressure, letter dated March 16, 1979, written in
the petitioner's own hand as dictated by Lt. Col. Bajaj was taken and at the same time a number of
certificates were also taken from the petitioner. A Court of Inquiry was set up to inquire into the
allegations made against Major Malhotra by the petitioner. The Court of inquiry commenced
investigation on August 27, 1979. The petitioner submitted a request to summon 15 witnesses to
substantiate his allegation against Major Malhotra. Probably this request did not find favour and the
petitioner entertained a suspicion that the members constituting the Court of Inquiry were highly
prejudiced against him. The Court of Inquiry submitted its report. It is not necessary to recapitulate
the Pendings of the Court of Inquiry save and except that not only the Court of inquiry negatived all
the allegations of petitioner against Major Malhotra but on the contrary found that the petitioner
had taken some store items unauthorisedly on January 30, 1979, which were returned on January
31, 1979 Pursuant to the findings of the Court of inquiry a charge-sheet was drawn up against the
petitioner for having committed offences under sections 52

(b), 56 (a) and 63 of the Act. Direction was given for recording summary of evidence. Subsequently
the impugned order convening the General Court Martial was issued. The petitioner thereupon filed
the present petition. H In each petition legality and validity of the order convening the General
Court Martial more particularly the composition of the Court Martial in respect of each petitioner is
questioned. The challenge up to a point proceeds on grounds common to all the three petitions and
they may be dealt with first.

The contention is that the Constitution of General Court Martial in each case is illegal and contrary
to rule 40 and, therefore the order constituting the General Court Martial in each case must be
quashed.

The web of argument is woven round the true construction and intendment underlying rule 40. It
was said that the grammatical construction must accord with the underlying intendment of rule 40
and that the approach must be informed by the expanding jurisprudence and widening horizon of
the subject of personal liberty in Art. 21 because in the absence of Art. 33 the procedure prescribed
for trial by the General Court Martial under the Act would have been violative of Art. 21. Approach,
it was urged, must be to put such liberal construction on rule 40 as to sub- serve the mandate of Art.
21. Army, with its total commitment to national independence against foreign invasion must equally
be assured the prized liberty of individual member against unjust encroachment. It was said that the
court should strike a just balance between military discipline and individual personal liberty. And
door must not be bolted against principles of Natural justice even in respect of Army tribunal. An
unnatural distinction or differentiation between a civilian offender and an offender subject to the
Act would be destructive of the cherished principle of equality, the dazzling light of the Constitution
which illumines all other provisions The dominant purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain the
intention of the Parliament. One of the well recognised canons of construction is that the legislature
speaks its mind by use of correct expression and unless there is any ambiguity in the language of the
provision the Court should adopt literal construction if it does not lead to an absurdity. The first
question to be posed is whether there is any ambiguity in the language used in Rule 4o. If there is
none, it would mean the language used, speaks the mind of Parliament and there is no need to look
somewhere leers discover the intention or meaning. If the literal construction leads to an absurdity,
external aids to construction can be resorted to. To ascertain the literal meaning it is equally
necessary first to ascertain the juxtaposition in which the rule is placed, the purpose for which it is
enacted and the object which it is required to subserve and the authority by which the rule is
framed. This necessitates examination of the broad features of the Act.

The Act as its long title would show was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the
governance of the regular Army and it came into force on July 22, 1950. Section 2 sets out the
persons subject to the Act. Section 3 provides the dictionary clause. Sub-section (2) of section 3
defines 'civil offence' to mean an offence which is triable by a criminal court. Expression 'corps' is
defined in section 3 (vi) to mean any separate body of persons subject to the Act which is prescribed
as a corps for the purpose of all or any of the provisions of the Act. 'Department' has been defined in
placitium (ix) to include any division or branch of a department. Chapter III deals with the
commission, appointment and enrollment of Army personnel. Chapter IV sets out the statutory
conditions of service and Chapter V deals with service privileges. Chapter VI sets out various
offences made punishable by the Act. Section 69 provides that subject to the provisions of section 70
any person subject to the Act who at any place in or beyond India commits any civil offence shall be
deemed to be guilty of an offence against the 13 Act and if charged therewith under the section, shall
be liable to be tried by a court- martial and, on conviction, be punishable in the manner therein
prescribed. This provision would show that if any person subject to the Act commits any offence
triable by ordinary criminal court which for the purpose of the Act would be a civil offence, is liable
to be tried for the same, though not an offence P under the Act, by the court martial and be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 12Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

punishable in the manner prescribed in section 69. Section 70 carves out an exception in respect of
certain civil offences which cannot be tried by a court martial. In view of the provision prescribed in
section 69, a situation is bound to arise where an ordinary criminal court and the court martial both
will have jurisdiction to try a person for having committee a certain civil offence. To avoid conflict of
jurisdiction, section t25 is enacted conferring a discretion on the officer commanding the army,
Army corps, division or independent brigade in which the accused person is serving or such other
officer as may be prescribed to decide before which court the proceeding shall be instituted and if
that officer decides that it should be instituted before a court-martial, to direct that the accused
person shall be detained in military custody. Section 126 coufers power on the criminal court to
require the officer who has decided to use his discretion in favour of court-martial under section t25,
to deliver the accused to the nearest magistrate to be proceeded against according to law, or he may
direct the officer to postpone proceedings pending a reference to the Central Government. On such a
reference being made, the Central Government will have power to determine whether the person
should be tried by an ordinary criminal court or by a Court Martial and the decision of the Central
Government in this behalf is rendered final. A successive trial by a court-martial and the ordinary
criminal court is distinctly possible in view of the provision contained in section 127. Chapter VII
sets out the various punishments which can be imposed under the Act. Chapter VIII deals with
penal deductions that can be made from the pay and allowances of an officer. Chapter IX provides
for arrest and proceedings before trial. Section 108 in Chapter X provides that there shall be four
kinds of court-martial: (a) general courts-martial; (b) district courts-martial, (c) summary general
courts-martial; and. (d) summary courts-martial. Section 109 to 112 confer power on various
authorities to convene one or other kind of court- martial. Section 113 provides for composition of
General Court-Martial and it may be extracted:

"113. A general court-martial shall consist of not less than five officers, each of whom
has held a commission for not less than three whole years and of whom not less than
four are of a rank not below that of captain."

Section 118 confers power on general or summary general court martial to try any person subject to
the Act for any offence punish able therein and to pass any sentence authorised thereunder. Chapter
XI prescribes procedure of court-martial. Sec. 129 provides that every court-martial shall, and every
district or Summary general court martial may, be attended by a judge-advocate, who shall be either
an officer belonging to the department of the Judge-Advocate General, or any of his deputies.
Section 130 of the Act is important and it may be extracted:

"130. (D At all trials by general, district or summary 1 general court-martial, as soon
as the court is assembled, the names of the presiding officer and members shall be
read over to the accused, who shall thereupon be asked whether he objects to being
tried by any officer sitting on the court.

(2) If the accused objects to any such officer, his objection and also the reply thereto
of the officer objected to, shall be heard end recorded, and the remaining officers of
the court shall, in the absence of the challenged officer decide on the objection. (3) If
the objection is allowed by one-half or more the votes of the officers entitled to vote,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 13Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

the objection shall be allowed, and the member objected to shall retire, and his .
vacancy may be filled in the prescribed manner by another officer subject to the same
right of the accused to object. (4) When no challenge is made, or when challenge has
has been made and disallowed, or the place of every officer successfully challenged
has been filled by another officer to whom no objection is made or allowed, the court
shall proceed with the trial."

Section 133 provides that the Indian evidence Act, 1872, shall, subject to the provisions of the Act,
apply to all proceedings before a court-martial. Chapter XII provides for confirmation of the finding
and sentence and revision thereof. Chapter XIII deals with the execution of sentence awarded by
court-martial. Chapter XIV deals with pardons, remissions and suspensions of sentence. Section 191
in Chapter XV confers power to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of
the Act and without prejudice to the generality of the power so conferred by sub-section(l), the rules
made inter alia may provide for convening and constituting of court-martial and the appointment of
prosecutors at trials by courts-martial adjournment, dissolution and sitting of court-martial and the
procedure to be observed in trials by courts-martial and the appearance of legal practitioners threat.

Armed with these powers Army Rules, 1954 have been framed. To begin with, the Rules in Chapter
V may be noticed. Rule 22 prescribes procedure for hearing of charge at a stage anterior to the
convening of court-martial. After this preliminary hearing of the charge, if further action is
contemplated, rule 23 prescribes procedure for recording summary of evidence. After recording
summary of evidecne rule 24 enables the Commanding officer either to remand the accused for trial
by a court-martial or refer the case to the proper superior military authority or if he thinks it
desirable, re-hear the case and either dismiss the charge or dispose of it summarily. Rule 25
provides procedure for inquiry of charge against an officer, the salient feature of it is that the
procedure prescribed in rule 22 and 23 is required to be followed in the case of an officer if he so
requires.

Rule 28 sets out the general format of charge-sheet and rule 30 prescribes contents of charges. Rule
33 enacts detailed provisions for preparation for defence by the accused which amongst others
confer a right on the accused person to interview any witness he wishes to call for his defence and an
embargo on censoring his correspondence with his legal advisers as also a prohibition on
interviewing the witnesses whom the accused wishes to- call in his defence. Rule 34 provides for
assistance to the accused to summon his witnesses. Rule 37 provides for convening of general and
district courts-martial. Rule 37(1) and (2) were relied upon in support of a submission by Mr.
Sanghi, which provides that the convening officer before convening court martial has to satisfy
himself that the charges to be tried by the court are for offences within the meaning of the Act and
that the evidence justifies a trial of those charges and if not so satisfied, he is entitled to order the
release of the accused or refer the case to the superior military authority.

Rule 41 provides that on the Court assembling, the order convening the court shall be laid before it
together with the charge-sheet and the summary of evidence or a true copy thereof and also names,
ranks and corps of the officers appointed to serve on the Court. A duty is cast on the court to satisfy
itself that it is legally constituted and one such duty being that the court, as far as it can ascertain,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 14Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

shall satisfy itself that it has been convened in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the
Rules and that each of the officer com posing the court-martial is eligible and not disqualified for
serving on that court-martial and further in case of a general court-martial, the officers are of the
required rank. After the court has satisfied itself about its constitution, it shall cause the accused to
be brought before it as provided in rule 43. Rule 44 enables the accused as required by section 130 of
the Act to state whether he has any objec
tion to be tried by any officer sitting on the Court. A detailed procedure is prescribed for disposing of
the objection. Elaborate trial procedure is prescribed in the event the accused pleads not guilty and
barring minor situational variants the procedure prescribed is analogous to the one prescribed in
the Code of Criminal Procedure for trial of an accused by the Court of Sessions. A reference to rule
95 is advantageous. It enables an accused person to be represented by any person subject to the Act
who shall be called the defending officer or assisted by any person whose services he may be able to
procure and who shall be called the friend of the accused. Rule 96 confers power subject to the Rules
on the Chief of the Army Staff to permit counsel to appear on behalf of the prosecutor and the
accused at general and district courts-martial if the Chief of the Army Staff or the convening officer
declares that it is expedient to allow the appearance of counsel thereat, and such declaration may be
made as regards all general and district court-martial held at any particular place, or as regards any
particular general or district court martial, and may be made subject to such reservation as to cases
on active service, or otherwise, as seems expedient. In case of a general court-martial where it is
obligatory to associate a Judge-Advocate, rule 105 provides for powers duties and obligations of the
Judge Advocate, one such being that both the prosecutor and the accused are entitled to his opinion
on any question of law relating to the charge or trial. Rule 177 provides for setting up of a Court of
Inquiry its composition and the subsequent rules provide for the procedure to be followed by a
Court of Inquiry. Rule 180 provides that whenever an inquiry affects the character or military
reputation of a person subject to the Act, full opportunity must be afforded to such person of being
present throughout the inquiry and of making any statement and of giving any evidence he may
wish to make or give and of cross-examining any witness whose evidence in his opinion affects his
character or military reputation and producing any witnesses in defence of his character or military
reputation This rule was relied on by Mr. Sanghi to urge that whenever character or military
reputation of a person subject to the Act is involved it is obligatory to set up a Court of Inquiry. On a
plain reading of rule 180, the submission is without merits but that would come later. Rule 187 has
reference to s. 3(vi). It prescribes that bodies of persons subject to the Act are to be treated a 'Corps'
for the purpose of Chapter 111 and s. 43(a) of the Act and Chapters II and III of the Rules.

At this stage it would be profitable to refer to Article 33 of the Constitution which reads as under:

"33. Power to Parliament to modify the rights confer red by this Part in their
application to forces: Parliament may by law determine to what extend any of the
rights conferred by this Part shall, in their application to the members of the Armed
Forces or the Forces charged with the maintenance of public order, be restricted or
abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties, and the maintenance
of discipline among them."

Chapter IV in the Rules specifies restrictions on the fundamental rights. Rule 19 prescribes
restrictions on the fundamental freedom under Art. 19(1) (c), to wit, to form associations or unions.
Similarly rules 20 and 21 prescribe restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed
under Art. 19(1) (a). No contention was advanced before us in respect of restrictions prescribed by
rules - 19, 20 and 21 on the freedom of speech and expression and the freedom of forming
associations and unions. The contention was that a trial by a court-martial would result in
deprivation of personal liberty and it can only be done in view of Art. 21, by procedure established by
law and the law prescribing such procedure must satisfy the test prescribed by Arts. 14 and 19. It
was contend ed that in view of the decision in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India(1) the law to satisfy
the test of Art. 21 must be just, fair and reasonable and if the procedure prescribed by the Code of
Criminal procedure for trial of offences is just, fair and reasonable, any deviation therefrom in the
procedure prescribed for trial by court-martial would neither be just, fair nor reasonable and it
would be violative of Art. 21. The question really is, how far this contention about violation of Art. 21
is available in view of the provision contained in Art. 33. The contention is that in order to satisfy the
requirement of Art. 33, Parliament must enact specific law specifying therein the modification of the
rights conferred by Part III and that a restriction or abrogation of fundamental rights cannot be left
to be deduced or determined by implication. In other words, the submission is that the law to satisfy
the requirement of Art. 33 must be a specific law enacted by Parliament in which a specific provision
imposing restriction or even abrogation of fundamental rights should be made and when such
provisions are debated by the Parliament it would be clear as to how far restriction is imposed by
Parliament on the fundamental rights enacted in Part Ill in their application to the members of the
Armed Forces or the forces charged with the maintenance of public order. Submission is that a
conscious and deliberate Act of Parliament may permit erosion of fundamental rights in their
application to Armed Forces. Such a serious inroad on fundamental rights cannot be left to Central
Government to be done by delegated legislation. Article 33 permits Parliament by law to not merely
restrict but abrogate the fundamental rights enacted in Part III in their application to the members
of Armed Forces. The act was enacted in 1950 and was brought into force on July, 1950. Thus the
Act was enacted after the Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950. When power to legislate
is conferred by Constitution, and Parliament enacts a legislation, normal inference is that the
legislation is enacted in exercise of legislative power and legislative craftmanship does not
necessitate specifying the powers Since the Constitution came into force, Parliament presumably
was aware that its power to legislate must be referable to Constitution and therefore it would be
subject to the limitation prescribed by the Constitution. Whenever a legislation is being debated for
being put on the statute book, Arts. 12 and 13 must be staring into the face of that body.
Consequently when the Act was enacted not only Arts. 12 and 13 were sovering over the provisions
but also Art. 33 which to some extent carves out an exception to Arts. 12 and 13 must be present to
the corporate mind of Parliament which would imply that Parliament by law can restrict or abrogate
fundamental rights set out in part III in their application to Armed Forces. But it was said that by
contemporane expositio Section 21 of the Act clearly sets out the limits of such restriction or
abrogation and no more. Section 21 confers power on the Central Government to make rules
restricting to such extent and in such manner as may be necessary to modify the fundamental
freedom conferred by Art. 19(1) (a) and (c) in their application to Armed Forces and none other
meaning that Armed forces would enjoy other fundamental freedoms set out in part III. Armed with
this power, rules 12, 20 & 21 have been framed by the Central Government. Taking cue from Sec. 21

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 16Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

and Rules 19, 20 and 21, it was submitted that while Art. 33 enables the Parliament by law to
abrogate or restrict fundamental rights in their application to Armed Forces, Parliament exercised
the same power limited to what is prescribed in Sec. 21 and specified the restrictions in rules 19, 20
and 21 and, therefore, the remaining fundamental rights in Part III are neither abrogated nor
restricted in their application to the Armed Forces. Consequently it was urged that the Act
prescribing the procedure of court-martial must satisfy the requirement of Art. 21.

While investigating and precisely ascertaining the limits of inroads or encroachments made by
legislation enacted in exercise of power conferred by Art. 33, on the guaranteed fundamental rights
to all citizens of this country without distinction, in respect of armed personnel, the court should be
vigilant to hold the balance between two conflicting public interests; namely necessity of discipline
in armed personnel to preserve national security at any cost, because that itself would ensure
enjoyment of fundamental rights by others, and the denial to those responsible for national security
of these very fundamental rights which are inseperable adjuncts of civilised life.

Article 33 confers power on the Parliament to determine to what extent any of the rights conferred
by part III shall, in their application to the members of the Armed Forces-, be restricted or
abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of duties and maintenance of discipline amongst
them. Article 33 does not obligate that Parliament must specifically adumberate each fundamental
right enshrined in part III and to specify in the law enacted in exercise of the power conferred by
Art. 33 the degree of restriction or total abrogation of each right. That would be reading into Article
33 a requirement which it does not enjoin. In fact, after the Constitution came into force, the power
to legislate in respect of any item must be referrable to an entry in. the relevant list. Entry 2 in list I:
Naval, Military and Air Force and any other Armed Forces of the Union, would enable Parliament to
enact the Army Act and armed with this power the Act was enacted in July, 1950. [t has to be
enacted by the Parliament subject to the requirements of part III of the Constitution read with
Article 33 which itself forms part of part III. Therefore, every provision of the Army Act enacted by
the Parliament, if in conflict with the fundamental rights conferred by Part III, shall have to be read
subject to Art. 33 as being enacted with a view to either restricting or abrogating other fundamental
rights to the extent of inconsistency or repugnancy between Part Ill of the constitution and the Army
Act. This is no more res integra in view of the decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in
Ram Sarup v. Union of India & Another(]) in which repelling the contention that the restriction or
abrogation of the fundamental rights in exercise of the power conferred by Art. 33 is limited to one
set out in sec. 21 of the Act, this Court observed as under:

"The learned Attorney-General has urged that the entire Act has been enacted by
Parliament and if any of the provisions of the Act is not consistent with the provisions
of any of the articles in Part III of the Constitution, it must be taken that to the extent
of the inconsistency Parliament had modified the fundamental rights under - those
articles in their application to the person subject to , that Act. Any such provision in
the Act is as much law as the entire Act. We agree that each and every provision of the
Act is a law made by Parliament and that if any such provision tends to effect the
fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution, that provision does not, on
that account, become void, as it must be taken that Parliament has thereby in the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 17Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

exercise of its power under Art. 33 of the Constitution made the requisite
modification to affect the . respective fundamental rights."

Section 21 merely confers an additional power to modify rights conferred by Art. 19(1) (a) and (c) by
Rules and such rules may set out the limits of restriction. But the specific provision does not
derogate from the generality of power conferred by Art. 33. Therefore, it is not possible to accept the
submission that the law prescribing procedure for trial of offences by court martial must satisfy the
requirement of Art. 21 because to the extent the procedure is prescribed by law and if it stands in
derogation of Art. 21, to that extent Art. 21 in its application to the Armed Forces is modified by
enactment of the procedure in the Army Act itself.

Incidentally a reference was made to Dalbir Singh v. State of PunJab(2) but it hardly illuminates the
contours of controversy. The contention raised was that section 3 of the PEPSU Police (Incitement
to disaffection) Act, 1953, was violative of Article 19(1) (a) and was not saved by Art. 19(2). Repelling
this contention a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the Police service is an arm of the State
charged with the duty of ensuring and maintaining public order and since any breach of discipline
on the part of its members might result in a threat to public order, section 3 must be held, to be valid
as having been enacted in the interest of public order within the meaning of Art. 19(2). Attempt was
made to urge that as the Act in question was made by the President under Art. 356 of the
Constitution it would be an Act of Parliament in exercise of the power conferred by Art. 33 and as
the police force would be one such force as contemplated by Art. 33 charged with the maintenance
of public a order, the provisions of the Act would be beyond the challenge of Part III of the
Constitution. This contention was negatived on the ground that Art. 33 was not applicable because
parliament had delegated the powers of State legislature to the President and, therefore, any law
enacted by the President in exercise of this power would not have the force of Parliamentary
legislation contemplated by Art. 33. But this is hardly of any assistance. In Lt. Col. M.L.Kohli v.
union- af India & ors (1) the petitioner challenged certain provisions of the Army Act and it was
contended’ that Art. 33 does not cover ex-servicemen who are not serving members of the defence
forces. In fact, at the hearing of the petition the contention was withdrawn and, therefore, it is not
necessary to examine this decision any further.

Mr. Tarkunde, however, contended that the observations of the Constitution Bench in Ram Sarup's
case in respect of the provisions of the Act having been enacted by the Parliament in exercise of
powers conferred by Art. 33 and that each and every provision of the Act is a law made by
Parliament and if any such provision tends to affect the fundamental rights under Part III of the
Constitution, that provision does not, on that account become void as it must be taken that
Parliament has in exercise of its power under Art. 33 of the Constitution made the requisite
modification to affect the respective fundamental rights, are obiter. Proceeding along this line it was
submitted that the contention before the Constitution Bench was that Art. 22 of the Constitution
conferred a fundamental right on a person accused of an offence to be defended by a lawyer of his
own choice, the denial of this right to the accused would be violative of Art. 22 and the trial would be
A vitiated. It is true that this contention was repelled on the facts found, namely, that the petitioner
made no request for being represented at the court martial by a counsel of his own choice. Rule 96
of the Rules provides that subject to the Rules, counsel shall be allowed to appear on behalf of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 18Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

prosecutor and accused at general and district courts-martial if the Chief of the Army Staff or the
convening officer declares that it is expedient to allow the appearance of counsel thereat and such
declaration may be made as regards any particular general or district court-martial held in a
particular place etc. The question of validity of this Rule was kept open. Frankly, there is some force
in the contention of Mr. Tarkunde that once having found that the accused in that case made no
request for being defended by a lawyer of his choice he could not be heard to complain of
contravention or violation of the right under Art. 22 and, therefore, the question whether the whole
of the Act was enacted in exercise of the power conferred by Art. 33 did not specifically arise.
However, a contention was specifically canvassed before the Constitution Bench by the learned
Attorney-General that court may proceed on the basis that the request as claimed on behalf of the
accused in that case was made and turned down and yet the accused could not in that case complain
of contravention of Art. 22 of the Constitution and this contention was in terms answered. If in this
context the observation can be said to be obiter, it is nonetheless entitled to respect at our hands.

It was, however, contended that the question as to the validity of the Rules enacted in exercise of the
power conferred by section 191 having been kept open, this Court must examine the contention
afresh. It was urged that what Art. 33 protects is an Act made by p the parliament and not
subordinate legislation such as the Rules and the regulations. Section 191 confers power on the
Central Government to make rules for the purposes of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act.
Section 192 confers power on the Central Government to make regulations for all or any of the
purposes of the Act other than those specified in s.

191. Section 193 provides that all Rules and Regulations made under the Act shall be published in
the official gazette and on such publication shall have effect as if enacted in the Act. What character
the rules and the regulations acquire when a deeming fiction is enacted that if enacted in accordance
with the procedure prescribed they shall have effect as if enacted in the Act meaning thereby that
they are to be treated as part and parcel of the enactment itself ? In the Chief Inspector of Mines &
Anr. v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar etc.,(1) a Constitution Bench of this Court examined the positionof rules or regulations made under an Act having the effect as if enacted in the Act. After examining
various foreign decisions, the Court held as under:

"The true position appears to be that the rules and regulations do not loose their
character as rules and regulations, even though they are to be of the same effect as if
contained in the Act. They continue to be rules subordinate to the Act, and though for
certain purposes, including the purpose of construction, they are to be treated as if
contained in the Act, their true nature as subordinate rule is not lost."

The same question came up before a Constitution Bench in Kali Pada Chowdhury v. Union of
India,(2) and the majority has almost accepted the same view.

The effect of the expression ‘as if enacted in this Act' has occasionally presented difficulty arising
from the context in which the expression is used, If the expression were to mean that the rules or
regulations enacted or framed in exercise of the power to enact subordinate legislation having the
same force as the provisions of the statute which enables the subordinate legislation to be enacted, a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 19Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

question is bound to arise whether, if the provisions of the statute are not open to question the
subordinate legislation would also be immune from the challenge to its validity. In Institute of
Patent Agents v. Lockwood,(3) Lord Harschell was of the opinion that the expression ‘as if enacted
in this Act' would render the subordinate legislation as completely exempt from judicial review as
the statute itself. However, in R. v. Minister of Health, ex-parte Yaffe,(4) there was some
disinclination to accept Lord Herschell's opinion at least to its fullest extent. While distinguishing
Lockwood's case a note was taken of the fact that the rules framed in exercise of the power conferred
by s. 101(3) of the Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Acts of 1883 and 1888 would be subject to
control of Parliament and, therefore, Parliament was in control of the rules for 40 days after they
were passed and could have annulled them on a motion to that effect, and that would permit an
inference that they had same strength and validity as the provisions of the statute itself.
Distinguishing this position in Yafffe's case it was noticed that there was no parliamentary manner
of dealing with the confirmation of the scheme by the Ministry of Health and, therefore, it cannot
have the same efficacy and validity as the provisions of the statute. Subsequently, in Miller v.
Bootham,(I) the conflict between the view of Lord Harschall in Lockwood's case and the view of
Lord Dunedin in Yaffe's case was noticed but it was held to have no impact in that case because
power was reserved with the Secretary of State in the later factories Act of 1937 to bring the earlier
regulation in conformity with the intendment of the Act. It would, however, appear that this ancient
formula often resorted to, to clothe subordinate legislation with the force of the provisions of the
statute would require further consideration. . It is, however, not necessary to conclude this point
because the primary contention was about the non-compliance with rules rather than with their
validity.

Rule 40 provides for composition of court-martial. It reads as under:

"Composition of court-martial: (I) A general court martial shall be composed, as far
as seems to the convening officer practicable, of officers of different corps or
departments, and in no case exclusively of officers of the corps or department to
which the accused belongs.

(2) The members of a court-martial for the trial of an officer shall be of a rank not
lower than that of the officer p unless, in the opinion of the convening officer, officers
of much rank are not (having due regard to the exegencies of the public service)
available. Such opinion shall be re corded in the convening order.

(3) In no case shall an officer below the rank of captain be a member of a
court-martial for the trial of a filed officer.

The power to convene the General Court Martial is conferred of the Central Government, the Chief
of Army Staff or by any officer empowered in this behalf by warrant of the Chief of Army Staff.

The officer empowered to convenena general court-martial is designated in the rules as ‘convening
officer’. In the composition of court-martial there is both a positive and negative requirement to be

fulfilled. The positions requirement is that it shall be composed of officers of different corps or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 20Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

departments and the negative inhibition is that in any case it shall not be composed exclusively of
officers of the corps or departments to which the accused belongs. Both these requirements are
subject to the overriding consideration that it may be so done as far as it seems to the convening
officer practicable to do so. In other words, one or the other requirement may be given a go by if it is
otherwise found not to be practicable. Keeping aside the functional requirement of practicability of
comply- ing with rule 40, the convening officer in ordinary circumstance should arrange the
composition of the general court martial as to include officers of different corps or departments and
must avoid so composing the court-martial as to be exclusively of officers of the corps or department
to which the accused belongs. There is a further requirement in sub-section (2) which will be
presently examined. What constitutes Corps for the purposes of rule 40 is the bone of contention
between the parties. The expression 'department' did not present any difficulty. The definition of the
expression ‘department’ is an inclusive definition. The expression would include any division or
branch of a department. Learned Additional Solicitor-General stated that there is only one
department in the Army and that is the department of Judge-Advocate. There is no other
department. It is not necessary to dilate on this point because it was not contended on behalf of the
petitioners that the personnel of the court-martial belonged to the same department.

The expression ‘corps has been defined to mean any separate body of persons subject to the Act
which is prescribed as corps for the purposes of all or any of the provisions of the Act. And
‘prescribed’ means prescribed by rules made under the Act. Rule 187 bears the marginal note: 'Corps
prescribed under section 3(vi). Each of the separate bodies of persons subject to the Act set out in
sub-rule (I)

(a) to (y) is to be a corps for the purposes of Chapter III and s. 43(a) of the Act and Chapters I and
Ill of the Act. Sub- rule (3) provides that for the purposes of every other provision-H i.e., other than
Chapter III and s. 43.(a) of the Act and Chapters II and III of the Rules-each of the body of persons
set out in sub -clauses (a) to (f ) shall be deemed to be a corps. They are: (a) every battalion; (b)
every company which does not form part of battalion;

(c) every regiment of cavalry, armoured corps or artillery:

(d) every squadron or battery which does not form part of a regiment of cavalry, armoured corps or
artillery; (e) every school of instruction, training centre, or regimental centre; and (f ) every other
separate t unit composed wholly or partly of persons subject to the Act. To understand the full
import of the expressions ‘battalion’, 'company’, 'regiment', ‘squadron’ or ‘battery’, it was imperative
to understand - the hierarchy and vertical formations in the Army. National security demands that
on country would disclose its Army formations. But on the basis of the broad information available,
a chart roughly showing vertical hierarchy with horizontal equation was composed to understand
the meaning of the aforementioned expressions: C Supreme Commander = President of India Chief
of Army Staff = Chief of Army Staff Command = GOC-IN-C Commanding officer Army Corps Army
Corps Army Corps Army Corps =Lt. Gen. Division Division Division Division =Maj. Genl. Brigade
Brigade Brigade Brigade = Brigadier. Battalion Battalion Battalion Battalion =Lt. Col. (In Infantry)
Regiment in Cava]ry.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 21Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

Company Company Company Company = Major (In Infantry, Battery or Squadron in Cava]ry. - G
President is the Supreme Commander of Armed Forces [See Article 53(2)]. Under him is the Chiefof Army Staff. The Indian Army is divided into five commands being Northern, Central, Western,
Eastern and Southern Commands. Each area command has under It static formation areas,
sub-area, etc. and fighting for
mation army corps: for example, the Western Command is said to have three army corps. Corps in
this sense means army formation. Speaking generally, each army corp, is composed of three or four
divisions with an officer of the rank of Major General at its head; each division is divided into three
or four Brigades, each Brigade being commanded by a brigadier; each Brigade is composed of three
or four battalions so designated in the case of Infantry and Regiment in the case of Cavalry or its
modern equivalent; each battalion or regiment being commanded by an officer of the rank of Lt.
Col., each battalion is divided in three or four companies in case of Infantry and three or four
Batteries or Squadron in the case of cavalry, each such unit being led by an officer of the rank of a
Major.

To start with, the expression ‘army corps' should not be confused with the expression 'corps'. Both
connote a distinct and different unit in the army. Section 7 and Rule 189 operate in a different
situation. They merely specify who is the commanding officer of a person attached to corps,
department or detachment. Corps- forms a tiny small part of what is called Army Corps. The
expression 'Army Corps' used in s. 8 and s. 125 with its content and juxtaposition leaves no room for
doubt that the expression 'Army Corps' and 'corps' have different connotation. Once this is borne in
mind the meaning of the expression 'corps' in rule 40 does not present any difficulty.

Reverting to sub-rule (3) of rule 187 which prescribes corps for the purposes of s. 3(vi), every
battalion is a corps for the purposes of the Act and Rules. Now there may be a company but not
forming part of a battalion and may be independent of any battalion and, therefore, sub clause (b) of
sub-rule (3) of rule 187 treats such unattached Company not forming part of a battalion as a corps
by itself. That is equally true of regiment of cavalry, armoured corps or artillery. Undoubtedly, every
school of instruction, training centre or regimental centre cannot form part of a battalion and must
of necessity be a separate Corps. If we recall the composition as roughly sketched, every company is
part of some battalion because each battalion is sub-divided into companies. And that is possibly the
army unit which is being designated as Corps. Bearing in mind the designation of battalion in
infantry and regiment in cavalry, the unit designated as battalion or regiment will be a corps for the
purpose of the Act and the Rules. This conclusion is reinforced by reference to rule 187(1) in which
there are separate bodies of persons each by its very designation, duties and responsibilities and
functional requirement would not be part of regular army battalion and, therefore, each has to be
designated as a corps for the purposes of the Act and the Rules. If each battalion in the infantry or
regiment in cavalry would be a corps for the purposes of rule 40, the selection of personnel for
composing a general court martial would not present difficulty. If on the other hand as contended
for the petitioners that the expression 'corps' is an inter-changeable substitute for the expression
‘army corps’, the difficulty of setting up a general court-matial in strict compliance with rule 40
would be insurmountable. This can be demonstrably established if the composition of the army as
hereinabove set out is recalled for the limited purpose of pointing out that command is composed of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 22Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

army corps and each army corps is led by the officer of the rank of Lt. General. Expression
‘command' may be clarified in the sense that this country is divided into various commands such as
Western Command, Northern Command, etc. Now, if various army corps form part of the command
and if for setting up a general court- martial in strict compliance with rule 40 is to be insisted upon,
persons from different army corps have to be selected because as far as practicable officers of
different army corps-substituting the expression for corps-for the time being will have to be
selected. But the negative inhibition of rule 40 will present an insurmountable difficulty in that any
such general court martial shall not be composed exclusively of officers of the same corps.
Translated into functional adaptability officers under the same army corps attached to various
divisions, brigades under the various divisions, battalions under the brigades and companies under
the battalions will be disqualified from serving on the general court martial because they all belong
to the same ‘army corps’. That could not be the object underlying rule 40. Instead of vertical
movement, if a downward movement in the army command is taken into account to ascertain the
meaning of the expression 'corps’, rule 40 will become workable and would be easy to comply with.
What is positively desired is that for the composition of a general court-martial, one must strive to
secure services of officers of different corps or departments and what must be eschewed is its being
composed exclusively of officers of corps or departments to which the delinquent officer belongs. If
we give a restricted meaning to the expression 'corps' the rule becomes workable If wider meaning is
given so as to substitute 'army corps' for 'corps' it would be wholly unworkable because officers will
have to be summoned from another command altogether. Thus, if we take 'army corps' to mean the
same thing as 'corps' and if the accused belongs to a certain army corps all officers belonging to
various divisions under the same army corps, to all brigades under all the divisions of the same army
corps, to all battalions under all brigades of the same army corps and to all companies under all
battalions of the same army corps will be disqualified because they do not belong to the different
corps and are likely to be stigmatised as officers exclusively belonging to the same corps. A vertical
movement starting from the bottom which is indicated by reference to battalion and regiment in
sub-rule (3) of rule 187 clearly indicates that the lowest formation in the battalion or the regiment is
corps over and above those specifically designated as corps under rule 187(1). Therefore, it clearly
transpires that the expression 'corps' in rule 40 must be given the same meaning as set out in
sub-rule (3) of rule 187 and it would mean that every battalion in the infantry and every regiment in
the cavalry would by itself be a corps.

This interpretation accords with the intendment underlying rule 40. Rule 40 takes note of a possible
official bias or personal bias on account of close association. If officers belonging to the same corps
have to try brother officer, either there might be possible indulgence towards the brother officer or
familiarity in working together may have bred such contempt that bias is inevitable. To decry and
such possibility and to put personnel of general court-martial beyond reproach, to make it unbiased
and objective, composition of court-martial was to be so devised by statutory rules as to make it an
ideal body having all the trappings of a court. Two fundamental principles in this behalf are that the
judge must be unbiased and objective free from personal likes and dislikes or prejudice consequent
upon association of close familiarity. People drawn from ‘different corps' and avoiding officers of the
same corps composing the general court-martial would ensure an objective, unbiased body. If this is
the underlying intendment, it is achieved by giving the expression 'corps' a restricted meaning and
not a wide meaning to make it synonymous with 'Army Corps' at the top, so that it may almost

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 23Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

become impossible to search only officers belonging to different army corps and avoid meaning the
court-martial exclusively by officers belonging to same corps because a large body pf officers would
spill over the line. If on the other hand as is clearly indicated by sub-rule (3) of rule 187 a battalion
or a regiment is treated as a corps then it is easy to provide composition of court-martial in strict
compliance with rule

40. Under a brigade there are number of battalions. Each battalions would be a corps. Ore can easily
draw officers from different battalions as they would be belonging to different corps and one can
avoid what is negatively inhibited, viz., a general court-martial being composed exclusively of
officers of the corps to which the accused belongs. If the accused belongs to one battalion, even
under the same brigade there are number of battalions, and each battalion being a corps, officers
from battalions other than the battalion to which the accused belongs can be conveniently
summoned because each battalion is under the same brigadier. In this manner officers belonging to
different corps can be summoned and one can easily avoid a general court martial composed
exclusively of officers of the corps to which the accused belongs. It would be unwise to reject this
construction on the ground that it does not take note of and try to avoid command influence.
Command influence is too vague a concept to call in aid for construction of a rule. Viewed from
either angle the expression 'corps' in rule 40 is not used in the same sense in which the expression
‘army corps' is used but it is used in the sense in which it is defined and elaborated in rule

187. It was contended that the interpretation of rule 40 must be informed by the underlying
intendment that officers composing the court-martial must be independent of command influence
or influence of superior officers like the convening officer. This is unquestionably correct, save and
except saying what meaning one must assign to a loose expression like 'command influence’. If by
command one at the highest level such as commander-in-charge of area is the one likely to permeate
his influence down to the lowest it would be impossible to set up a court-martial of officers
belonging to entirely a different command. The expressions like the 'command influence’ and the
‘influence of superior officers' have to be understood in the context of the vertical hierarchy in the
composition of army. Once it transpires that the expression 'corps' in rule 40 has the same meaning
as has been set out in rule 187 and, therefore, a battalion would be a corps and an unattached
company can be a corps by itself, it becomes easy and practicable to set up a court martial in which
officers outside the corps would be available and such officers outside the same corps to which an
accused belongs could certainly be said to be free from command influence. But to urge that even if
the officers of another battalion but forming part of the same brigade are-selected the Brigadier
being the top officer under whom various battalions must be operating, the command influence will
permeate down, the same difficulty would arise as hereinbefore explicitly set out in setting up a
court-martial. The intendment underlying rule 40 is fully subserved by the interpretation, which the
language employed indicates, put on the expression 'corps' in rule 40.

Undoubtedly rule 40 by its very language is not mandatory. Rule on its own force insists on
compliance with its requirements as far as may be practicable. Even with this leeway, a strict
compliance with the requirements of Rule 40 must be insisted upon and the departure on the
ground of practicability will, if challenged, have to be proved-within the broad parameters of
functional adjustability of the Army requirements. If the interpretation convassed on behalf of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 24Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

petitioners is accepted every time the soul of rule 40 will be sacrificed at the alter of practicability
while the interpretation which we put on the expression 'corps' in rule 40 would help in avoiding
shelter under the practicability clause and that in a very large number of cases strict compliance
with rule 40 can be insisted upon. If a court martial is set up not in consonance with rule 40 and the
defence of practicability is advanced the same can be examined with precision. Therefore, the
expression 'corps' in rule 40 is not synonymous with the expression ‘army corps' and it must receive
a restricted construction with narrow connotation as explained in rule 187 (3).

There are two further requirements to be complied with while setting up a general court martial.
Section 113 provides that a general court martial shall consist of not less than five officers, each of
whom has held a commission for not less than three whole years and of whom not less than four are
of a rank not below that of captain. Sub-rule (2) of rule 40 adds one more condition that the
members of court-martial for trial of an officer shall be of a rank not lower than that of the officer
unless in the opinion of the convening officer, officers of such rank are not (having due regard to the
exigencies of public service) available. Such opinion has to be recorded in the convening order.
Sub-rule (3) of rule 40 merely incorporates the mandate of s. 113.

Having formulated the necessary test for examining the validity of the composition of general court
martial it is necessary to turn to the facts of each case in this behalf. Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi
(Writ Petition No. 4903/81) was holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and belonged to the 226
Regiment of 43 Artillery Brigade of 9th Infantry Division of the Indian Army at the relevant time.
The general court-martial set up to try him was composed of five officers. They are: Brigadier
Kalkat, an officer in rank higher than the petitioner, Lt. Col. Khullar, Lt. Col. Yadav, Lt. Col. Nathu
Singh and Lt. Col. Kohli, all of co- ordinate, same or of equal rank, and even though they all belong
to 9th Infantry Division, they are drawn from different brigades and regiments and that becomes
distinctly clear from the attachment of each set out in the order convening the general court-martial.
To. be precise, Lt. Col. Khullar was officer Commanding 168 Field Regiment, Lt. Col. Yadav Bhopal
Singh, S.M. Dogra was officer commanding 10 Dogra, Lt. Col. Nathu Singh, Punjab was officer
commanding 5th Rajputana Rifles. It would appear at a glance that even though all the five officers
belong to the 9th Division, none of them belongs to the same corps to which the petitioner belonged
and none was lower in rank than the rank held by the petitioner. Therefore, the requirement of rule
40 is strictly complied with and there is no contravention in letter and spirit thereof.

In the case of Capt. Dharam Pal Kukrety (Writ Petition No. 1513/79), the general court martial is
composed of seven officers. Petitioner Kukrety was holding the rank of a Captain. Of the seven
officers composing the court martial the senior-most is a Brigadier the next in rank is holding the
rank of Lt. Col. and the remaining five are of the rank of Major. Their designations and attachments
show that none of them is even equal in rank with the petitioner; each is holding a rank higher than
the petitioner. Petitioner at the relevant time belonged to 25 Infantry Division which is a division of
the 16th Corps of the Indian Army. And all the members composing the court-martial belonged to
the 25th Infantry Division which itself is a division of the 1 5th Corps of the Indian Army. But the
expression ‘corps’ qualifying '16th' is army corps and not corps as understood in rule 40. None of the
officers composing the general court-martial in the case belongs to the corps to which the petitioner
belonged. therefore, there is no violation of rule 40.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 25Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

The petitioner Capt. Chander Kumar Chopra (Writ Petition No. 5930/80) has alleged in his petition
that he belongs to the 33 corps and that each such corps is divided into divisions. This will clearly
show that by saying that he belongs to 33 corps he means to suggest that he belongs to 33 Army
Corps. At the relevant time the petitioner was holding the rank of a Captain and was attached to 877
At. BN. ASC c/o 99 A.P.O.. There is not one word in the petition that any of the officers composing
the general court-martial set up to try him, belongs to his corps in the sense in which the word has
been interpreted by us. Nor has he alleged that any one lower in rank than a Captain has been
nominated as a member of the general court-martial set up to try him. Therefore, a even in this case
there is nothing to show that rule 40 has been violated.

It would be advantageous at this stage to call attention to the provision contained in section 130 of
the Act and rules 41 to 44 of the Rules. When either a general, district or summary court martial is
assembled and the offender who is to be tried is brought before it, it is obligatory to read out the
names of the presiding officer and the members composing the court martial to the accused and he
is asked whether he objects to his being tried by any of the officers sitting on the court. Sub-section
(2) of section 130 requires that if the accused objects to any such officer, his objection and the reply
there to of the officer objected to shall be heard recorded and the remaining officers of the court
shall in the absence of the challenged officer decide the objection. The provision contained in section
130 is elaborated in rules 41 to 44. Rule 41 requires that as soon as the court assembles the order
convening the court shall be laid before it together with a charge sheet and summary of evidence as
also the ranks, names and corps of the officers appointed to serve on the court. A duty is cast on the
court to first ascertain whether it has been convened according to the provisions of the Act and the
rules. In order to find out whether rule 40 has been complied with or not, the corps to which each
officer composing the court martial is attached is to be set out and which will reveal at a glance
whether he is qualified to sit on the court. At this stage the accused does not enter into the picture.
The duty is cast on the court itself to ascertain whether its constitution is in accordance with the Act
and the rules. Rule 42 cast a duty on the court to satisfy itself that the person who is to be tried is
amenable to the provisions of the Army Act and that each charge framed against him discloses an
offence under the Act and is framed is accordance with the rules. Then A comes rule 43. After the
court has satisfied itself that rules 41 and 42 have been complied with the accused is to be brought
before the Court. Rule 44 provides that on the accused being brought before the court, the order
convening the court and the names of the presiding officer and the members of the court shall then
be read over to the accused and he shall be asked as required by section 1 30 whether he has any
objection to being tried by any officer serving in the Court. Whenever an objection is taken it has to
be recorded, In order to ensure that any one objected to does not participate in disposing of the
objection, clause (a) of the proviso to rule 44 directs that the accused shall state the names of all
officers constituting the court in respect of whom he has any objection before any objection is
disposed of. This is a mandatory requirement because the officer objected to cannot participate in
the decision disposing of the objection. It is true that if the court is not constituted in accordance
with the Act and the Rules, rule 44 would hardly assist because as in this case if the contention is
that rule 40 was . violated in constituting the court-martial and that each officer was disqualified
from being a member of the court-martial, there is none left to dispose of the contention. In such a
situation, rule 44 may not be helpful because once such an objection is taken no one shall be
competent to decide the objection. The provision conferring a right on the accused to object to a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 26Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

member of the court-martial sitting as a member and participating in the trial ensures that a charge
of bias can be made and investigated against individual members composing the court-martial. This
is preeminently a rational provision which goes a long way to ensure a fair trial. That stage is still to
come and therefore we refrain from pronouncing on any allegation of bias against individual
member of the court martial.

Similarly a very faint attempt made by Mr. Sanghi inviting us to examine the merits of the charge
against Lt. Colonel Bedi should not lure us into doing so. That is our function at any rate at this
stage and we steer clear the same.

Having examined the general contention as to the legality and validity of general court martial set
up in each of these cases, we may now turn to certain specific contentions raised in each petition.

In re. W.P. 4903/81:

Mr. Sanghi, learned counsel for the petitioner urged that pre condition to the trial by a general court
martial having not been satisfied, the order convening the general court martial to try the petitioner
is vitiated. Reliance was placed on rules 22, 23, 24 and 25. They may be extracted:

"22. Hearing of Charge:

(1) Every charge against a person subject to the Act other than an officer, shall be
heard in the presence of the accused. The accused shall have full liberty to cross
examine any witness against him, and to call any witnesses and make any statement
in his defence.

(2) The commanding officer shall dismiss a charge brought before him if in his
opinion, the evidence does not show that an offence under the Act has been
committed, and may do so if, in his discretion, he is satisfied that the charge ought
not to be proceeded with.

(3) At the conclusion of the hearing of a charge, if the commanding officer is of
opinion that the charge ought to be proceeded with, he shall without unnecessary

delay.

(a) dispose of the case summarily under section 80 in accordance with the manner
and form in Appendix III; or

(b) refer the case to the proper superior military authority; or
(c) adjourn the case for the purpose of having the evidence reduced to writing; or

(d) if the accused is below the rank of warrant officer, order his trial by a summary
court- martial.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 27Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

Provided that the commanding officer shall not order trial by a summary court-martial without a
reference to the officer empowered to convene a district court-martial or on active service a
summary general court-martial for the trial of the alleged offender unless A either
(a) the offence is one which he can try by a summary court martial without any
reference to that officer; or

(b) he considers that there is grave reason for immediate action and such reference
cannot be made without detriment to discipline.

23. Procedure for taking down the summary of evidence- (1) Where the case is
adjourned for the purpose of having the evidence reduced to writing. at the
adjourned hearing the evidence of the witnesses who were present and gave the
evidence before the commanding officer, whether against or for the accused, and of
any other person whose evidence appears to be relevant, shall be taken down in
writing in the presence add hearing of the accused before the commanding officer or
such officer as he directs.

(2) The accused may put in cross-examination such questions as he thinks fit to any
witness, and the questions together with the answers thereto shall be added to the
evidence recorded.

(3) The evidence of each witness after it has been recorded as provided in the rule
when taken down, shall be read over to him, and shall be signed by him, or if he
cannot write his name, shall be attested by his mark and witnessed as a token of the
correctness of the evidence recorded. After all the evidence against the accused has
been recorded; the accused will be asked: "Do you wish to make any statement ? You
are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will be
token down in writing and may be given in evidence." Any statement thereupon made
by . the accused shall be taken down and read over to him, but he will not be
cross-examined upon it. The accused . may then call his witnesses, including, if he so
desires, any witnesses as to character.

(4) The evidence of the witnesses and the statement (if any) of the accused shall be
recorded in the English language. If the witness or accused as the case may be, does
not understand the English language, the evidence or statement, as recorded shall be
interpreted to him in a language which he understands.

(5) If a person cannot be compelled to attend as a witness, or if owing to the
exigencies of service or any other grounds (including the expense and loss of time
involved), the attendance of any witness cannot in the opinion of the officer taking
the summary (to be certified by him in writing), be readily procured, a written
statement of his evidence purporting to be signed by him may be read to the accused
and included in the summary of evidence.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 28Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

(6) Any witness who is not subject to military law may be summoned to attend by
order under the hand of the commanding officer of the accused, The summons shall
be in the form provided in Appendix III.

24. Remand of accused: (I) The evidence and statement (if any) taken down in
writing in pursuance of rule 23 (hereinafter referred to as the "summary of
evidence"), shall be considered by the commanding officer, who thereupon shall
either
(a) remand the accused for trial by a court-martial; or
(b) refer the case to the proper superior military authority; or

(c) if he thinks it desirable, re-hear the case and either dismiss the charge or dispose
of it summarily.

(2) If the accused is remanded for trial by a court- martial, the commanding officer
shall without unnecessary delay either assemble a summary court
martial (after referring to the officer empowered to convene a district court-martial or on active
service as summary general court-martial when such reference is necessary) or apply to the proper
military authority to convene a A court-martial, as the case may require.

25. Procedure on charge against officer: (I) Where an officer is charged with an offence under the
Act, the investigation shall, if he requires it, be held and the evidence, if he so requires, be taken in
his presence, in writing, in the same manner as nearly as circumstances admit, as is required by rule
22 and rule 23 in the case of other persons subject to the Act.

(2) When an officer is remanded for the summary disposal of a charge against him or is ordered to
be tried by a court-martial without any such recording of evidence in his presence, an abstract, of
evidence to be adduced shall be delivered to him free of charge as provided in sub-rule (7) of rule

33."

The submission is that before a general court martial is convened as provided in rule 37 it is
obligatory for the commanding officer to hear the charge made against the accused in his presence
giving an opportunity to the accused to cross-examine any witness against him and to call any
witness and make any statement in his defence and that if the commanding officer is so satisfied he
can '.. dismiss the charge as provided in sub-rule (2) of rule 22. If at the conclusion of the hearing
under rule 22 the commanding officer is of the opinion that the charge ought to be proceeded with,
he has four options open to.him, one suchbeing toadjourn the caseforthe - . purpose of having the
evidence reduced to writing, called summary of evidence. Rule 23 prescribes the procedure for
taking down the summary of evidence which, inter alia, provides recording of the evidence of each
witness, opportunity to the accused to cross-examine each such witness, etc. Rule 24 provides that
the summary of evidence so recorded shall be considered by the commanding officer who at that

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 29Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

stage has again three courses open to him, to wit, (a) remand the accused for trial by a court-martial,
(b) refer the - case to the proper superior military authority; and (c) if he thinks it desirable, re-hear
the case and either dismiss the charge or dispose - it of summarily. It was urged that in case of the
petitioner Lt. Col.Bedi, the commanding officer did not hear the charge in his presence that no
direction to prepare a summary of evidence in which he could participate was given and that without
complying with the mandatory requirements of rules 22 and 23 a direction has been given to
convene the court-martial to try the petitioner. Rules 22 to 24 are mandatory in respect . Of every
person subject to the Act other than an officer. Therefore, the requirements of rules 22 to 24 are not
mandatory in case of an officer and this becomes manifestly clear from sub-rule (1) of rule 25 which
provides that where an officer is charged with an offence under the Act, the investigation shall, if he
reguires it, be held, and the evidence, if he so requires, be taken in his presence in writing in the
same manner as nearly as circumstances admit, as is required by rule 22 and rule 23 in the case of
other persons subject to the Act. The opening words of rule 22 clearly derr.onstrate the mandatory
applicability of the provisions in rule 22 and 23 rule in case of persons subject to the Act other than
officers. Any lurking doubt in that behalf is removed by the language of rule 25 which provides that
if an officer is charged with an offence under the Act, the investigation, if he required, shall be held
and the evidence, if he requires shall be held aDd the evidence, if requires it, shall be taken in his
presence. The petitioner is an officer. Therefore, the procedure prescribed in rules 22 and 23 will not
apply porprio vigor to him. If he wants rules 22 and 23 rule to be complied with, it is for him to
make a request in that behalf. He has to make a two-fold request: (I) that the investigation shall be
done in his presence; and (2) the summary of evidence shall also be drawn in his presence.
Petiti-oner in this case has averred in his petition that the commanding officer did not hear the
charge as required by rule 22 and, therefore, he could not participate in the hearing of the charge
nor could be cross- examine the witnesses and make his submissions. He further stated that no
charge-sheet was given to him. He has averred that the order dated November IO, 1980, for taking
down summary of evidence is void and illegal as it is violative of Rule 23 cf the Rules. Mr. Sanghi
contended that failure to comp1y with rules 22, 23 and 24 has denied to the petitioner an
opportunity first to convince the commanding officer to dismiss the charge under sub-rule (2) of
rule 22 and even if he could not have persuaded the commanding officer to dismiss the charge after
the summary of evidence was recor(led, he could have persuaded the commanding officer under rule
24 either to refer the case to superior military authority or re-hear it and dismiss the charge and this
dential of opportunity vitiates the subsequent trial by general court martial. Nowhere in the petition
the petitioner has specifically stated that he did make a request that the investigation shall be done
in his presence and that the summary of evidence should be recorded in his presence. There is utter
sphinx like silence on this point. In para 39 of the counter-affidavit on behalf of the respondents it is
specifically stated that rule 25 requires that if an officer wants rules 22 and 23 to be complied with,
he has to make a request in that behalf and tbat the petitioner never made such a request at the
appropriate time and, therefore, cannot now make a grievance that rules 22 and 23 have not been
complied with. There is no rejoinder to the affidavit. Therefore, it is crystal clear that in the absence
of a request from the petitioner as-required by rule 2S, failure to comply with rules 22, 23 and 24
would not vitiate the trial by the general court-ma.tial. Rex v. Thomson,(1) was relied upon to
buttress the submission that there has to be hearing of the charge by the officer Commanding in the
presence of the offender and the offentler should be afforded full opportunity to be heard before a
court martial is convened and this is a mandatory requirement and the courts must draw a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 30Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

distinction between what is merely irregular and what is of such a character as to be of substance. It
was urged that compliance with this procedure which affords full opportunity of participation
cannot be treated as merely directory but must be held to be mandatory to ensure a just and fair trial
and its violation must be held to vitiate the order convening the courtmartial and the order would be
without jurisdiction. It may be pointed out that the offender in the case before the court in that case
was a non-commissioned officer governed by the Army Act, 1881.He was thus a person other than
an officer subject to the Army Act aDd the mandate of rules 22 and 23 in his case would have
applied in all its rigour but as has been pointed out tbe petitiooer in the present case is an officer and
unless he requires it, rules 22 and 23 are not required to be complied with and, therefore, the
decision does not advance his any further. Therefore, there is no merit in this CODtention.

Incidentally it was urged that to the extend rule 25 erodes mandatory compliance with principles of
natural justice as adumberated in rules 22, 23 and 24 it would be violative of fundameDtal rights
guaranteed uDder Article 21 of the Constitution and would be ultra vir.?s the Constitution. Referring
to Lee v Showmen's Guild of Great Britain,(1) it was urged that public policy would invalidate any
stipulation excluding the application of the rules of natural justice to a tribunal whose decision was
likely to result in deprivation of personal liberty. Continuing along this line it was urged that to the
extent the application of minimum principles of natural iustice enacted in rules 22, 23 and 24
depends for its applicability upon the demand by tbe officer it would be contrary to public policy
which mandates that compliance with rules of natural justice should not be made dependent upon a
requisition by the person against whom the inquiry is held but it must be deemed to be obligatory
and an integral part of any procedure prescribed for a Tribunal whose decision is likely to result in
deprivation of personal liberty. It has already been pointed out that Parliament has the power to
restrict or abrogate any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution in their application to
the members of the Armed Forces so as to ensure the proper discharge of duties and maintenance of
discipline amongst them. The Act is one such law aad,therefore, any of the provisions of the Act
cannot be struck down on the only ground that they restrict or abrogate or tend to restrict or
abrogate any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution and this would indisputably
include Article 21. But even apart from this, it is not possible to subscribe to the view that even
where the prescribed procedure inheres compliance with principles of natural justice but makes the
same dependent upon the requisition by the person against whom the inquiry is held, it would be
violative of Article 21 which provides that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal 1iberty
except according to the procedure established by law. If the procedure established by law prescribes
compliance with principles of natural justice but makes it dependent upon a requisition by the
person against whom an inquiry according to such procedure is to be held, it is difficult to accept the
submission that such procedure would be violative of Art. 21. And as far as the Rules are concerned,
they have made clear distinction between an offlcer governed by tlie Act and any other person
subject to tbe Act. Expression 'officer' has been defined to mean a person commissioned, gazetted or
in pay as an officer in the regular Army and includes various other categories set out therein. By the
very definition an officer would be a person belonging to the upper bracket in the Armed Forces and
any person other than an officer subject to the provisions of the Act would necessarily imply persons
belonging to the lower categories in the army service. Now, in respect of such persons belonging to
the lower category it is mandatory that rules 22, 23 and 24 have to be followed and there is no
escape from it except on the pain of invalidation of the inquiry. But when it comes to an officer, a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 31Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

person belonging to the upper bracket in the armed forces the necessary presumption being that he
is a highly educated, knowledgeable, intelligent person, compli- ance with rules 22, 23 and 24 is not
obligatory but would have to be J . complied with if the officer so requires it. This is quite rational
and understandable. One cannot be heard to say that he would not insist upon an inquiry in which
he can participate which is his right, and then turn round and contend that failure to hold the
inquiry in accordance with the principles of natural justice as enacted in rules - 22, 23 and 24
though he did not insist upon it, would not merely invalidate the inquiry but the rule which requires
compliance at the h request of the officer is in itself on that account ultra vires It, was, however,
urged that in view of the decisions of this Court tn Mohinder Singh Gill and Anr. v. The Chief
Election Commissioner, f New Delhi & orS.,(1) and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, it is an
incontrovertible proposition of law that even while finding a balance between need for expedition
and need to give full opportunity to the person against whom the inquiry is held, "a body charged
with a duty to act judicially must comply with the minimum requirements of natural justice and that
if observance of natural justice in the area of administrative decision making so as to avoid
devaluation of the principle by administrators already alarmingly insensitive to the rationale of audi
alterm partem" that one can ever look upon with equanimity where this principle gives way before a
tribunal charged . P with a duty to act judicially. As has been pithily observed by an author. such an
overemphasis overlooking the other procedural safeguards prescribed, "indeed wears an engaging
air of simplicity and reason but having examined the entire procedure one can say confidently that
this simplicity is merely skin deep." Rules "2, 23 and 24 prescribe participation at a state prior to the
trial by the court martial. Undoubtedly, fairness in action and natural justice have been developing
very much in recent years and if the power of the executive increases the courts have developed the
doctrine in an evolving way so a striking out expendition is perilous.(1) By rejecting the contention a
striking expedition of this wholesome principle is not undertaken. It must, however, be pointed out
that in a trial which is likely to result in deprivation of liberty the body which has ultimated the
power to make an order which would result in deprivation of liberty, must hear the offender offering
full participation and that principle cannot be diluted. However, procedure prescribed in rules 22,
23 and 24 is at a stage anterior to trial by the court martial. It is the decision of the court martial
which would result in deprivation of liberty and not the order directing that the charge be heard or
that summary of evidence be recorded or that a court martial be convened. Even in normal trial
under the Criminal Procedure Code it has never been suggested that it is unfair to launch a criminal
prosecution without first hearing the accused (see Lord Salmond in Cozens v. North Doven Hospital
Management Committee(a). Therefore, there is no substance in the contention that rules 22, 23 and
24 in view of the provision contained in rule 25 are ultra vires Article 21 of the Constitution.

Mr. Banerjee, learned Additional Solicitor-General in this context urged that even if it is felt that
there is some violation of the provisions contained in rules 22, 23 and 24 in case of an officer as the
officer will have an opportunity to exhaustively participate in the trial by the court martial the
irregularity emanating from non-compli - ance with rules 22, 23 and 24 would not vitiate the order
convening the court-martial. Reliance was placed on Major G. Barasay v. The State of Bombay,(3) in
which the question arose whether an investigation by an officer of the Delhi Special Police
Establishment who undertook investigation of the case and failed to comply with two pre-conditions
incorporated in the proviso to s. SA of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1950, the investigation was
vitiated and the trial upon such investigation would be bad. The High Court held that the two

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 32Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

conditions had not been complied with by the investigating officer but after considering the entire
evidence observed that the alleged irregularity would not justify the conclusion that the non
observance of the conditions prescribed in the priviso to s. 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act
had resulted in failure of justice.

This Court agreed with this conclusion. Drawing sustenance from this conclusion it was urged that
irregularity in the course of investigation, if any, would not vitiate the trial but in such a situation
the court must examine evidence more carefully. As we are of the opinion that the failure to comply
with the requirements of rules 22, 23 and 24 depended upon a requisition by the petitioner, his
inaction or omission in that behalf would have no impact on the order convening the court-martial.

Reference was also made to Flying Officer S. Sundarajan v.Union of India & ors. ,(') where a Full
Bench of the Delhi High Court held that any error or irregularity in complying with tho procedure
prescribed by rule IS of the Indian Air Force Rules which is in pari materia with rule 22 of the Rules
would not vitiate the trial and ultimate conviction of the accused because of any error or irregularity
at a stage before the accused is charged for the purpose of having the evidence reduced to writing
and it will not vitiate the subsequent trial as the guilt of the accused has to be established not on the
basis of what the commanding officer might have done or might not have done at the initial stage. It
was further held that any irregularity in the procedure at that initial stage might have a bearing on
the veracity of witnesses examined at the trial or on the bonafides of the commanding officer or on
the defence that may be set up by the accused at the trial but the irregularity can by no means be
regarded as affecting the jurisdiction of the court to proceed with the trial. Jurisprudentially
speaking the view expressed is that Rule 15 is directory and its contravention has no impact on the
subsequent trial. Frankly, we have our reservations about the view taken by the Full Bench of the
Delhi High Court but as we have held that rules 22, 23 and 24 have not been violated on account of
the failure of the petitioner to insist upon their compliance which it was obligatory upon him to do,
we refrain from expressing any opinion on this point.

Mr. Sanghi next contended that it is obligatory upon the authorities concerned to appoint a court of
inquiry whenever an inquiry affects the character or military reputation of a person subject to the
Act and in such an inquiry full opportunity must be afforded to such person of being present
throughout the inquiry and of making any statement or giving any evidence he may wish to make or
give and of cross-examining any witness whose evidence in his opinion affects the character or
military reputation and producing any witness in defence of his character or military reputation.
There are some provisions in the Act which order setting up of a Court of Inquiry in the
circumstances and for the purpose set out in the provisions. Section 89 permits collective fines to be
imposed in the circumstances therein mentioned but the same can be done after obtaining the
report of court of inquiry. In other words, where it is considered necessary and permisible under the
Act to impose a collective fine it can be done after obtaining the report of a court of inquiry which
will presage an appointment of a such a court of inquiry. Similarly, section 106 comprehends the
appointment of a court of inquiry when any person subject to the Act has been absent from his duty
without due authority for a period of 30 days, and such court is required to inquire in respect of the
absence of the person and the deficiency if any in the property of the Government entrusted to his
care, or in any arms, ammunition, equipment, instruments, clothing or necessaries, and if satisfied

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 33Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

of the fact of such absence without due authority or other sufficient cause, the court shall declare
such absence and the period thereof, and the said deficiency, if any the commanding officer of the
corps or department to which the person belongs shall enter in the court-martial book of the corps
or department a record of the declaration. A reference to these two sections would show that where
action can be taken after obtaining report of the court of inquiry it has been so specified. Now, when
an offence is committed and a trial by a general court martial is to be held, there is no provision
which requires that a court of inquiry should be set up before the trial is directed. Mr.Sanghi,
however, urged that on a correct interpretation of rule 180, it would appear that whenever the
character of a person subject to the Act is involved in any inquiry, a court of inquiry must be set up.
Rule 180 does not bear out the submission. It sets up a stage in the procedure prescribed for the
courts of inquiry, Rule 180 cannot be construed to mean that whenever or wherever in any inquiry
in respect of any person subject to the Act his character or military reputation is likely to be affected
setting up of a Court of inquiry is a sine qua non. Rule 180 merely makes it obligatory that whenever
a court of inquiry is set up and in the course of inquiry by the court of inquiry character or military
reputation of a person is likely to be effected then such a person must be given a full opportunity to
participate in the proceedings of court of inquiry. Court of inquiry by its very nature is likely to
examine certain issue generally concerning a situation or persons. Where collective fine is desired to
be imposed, a court of inquiry may generally examine the shortfall to ascertain how many persons
are responsible. In the course of such an inquiry there may be a distinct possibility of character or
military reputation of a person subject to the Act likely to be affected. His participation cannot be
avoided on the specious plea that no specific inquiry was directed against the person whose
character or military reputation is involved. To ensure that such a person whose character or
military reputation is likely to be affected by the proceedings of the court of inquiry should be
afforded full opportunity so that nothing is done at his back and without opportunity of
participation, rule 180 merely makes an enabling provision to ensure such participation. But it
cannot be used to say that whenever in any other inquiry or an inquiry before a commanding officer
under rule 22 or a convening officer under rule 37 of the trial by a court martial, character or
military reputation of the officer concerned is likely to be affected a prior inquiry by the court of
inquiry is sine qua non. Therefore, the contention being without merits must be negatived.

It was next contended that the petitioner was not supplied the relevant documents asked for by him
and that, therefore, he is not being afforded a full and adequate opportunity to defend himself. Rule
33 ensures preparation for defence by the accused person. He has a right to call witnesses in his
defence. The limited grievance is that by his letter dated November 11, 1980, he requested that
documents concerning the case against him may be supplied to him. He also gave the name of Sub.
Gopal Chand as an essential witness. By his letter dated November 14, 1980, the petitioner
requested to supply him the copies of the documents therein listed. As the trial by the court martial
has not been commenced, we are sure that the authorities concerned will supply necessary
documents to the petitioner in order to avoid even a remote reflection that he was not given
adequate opportunity to defend himself.

In passing it is necessary to observe that the procedure prescribed for trial of sessions cases in
Chapter XVIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure when compared with the procedure prescribed for

trial by a general court martial there is very little deviation or departure and H more or less the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 34Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

procedure appears to be fair, just and reasonable, Dr. O. P. Sharma, Judge-Advocate-General,
Indian Army, in his Military Law in India, p. 156, after comparing the two procedures observes that
the procedure of trial by court martial is almost analogous to the procedure of trial in the ordinary
criminal courts. He points out two demerits, viz., a distinct possibility of a successive trial by a
criminal court and a court-martial exposing the accused to the hazards of double jeopardy, and the
absence of a provision for bail. The horrendous delay of trial in ordinary criminal courts has its
counterpart in delay in trial by court-martial also. Save and except this deficiency and one or two of
minor character both the procedures are almost identical and this aspect has to some extent
influenced our decision.

Writ Petitions 1513 of 1979 and 5930 or 1980:

Save and except the contention as to the validity of the com-position of the court martial no other
specific contention was raised in these two petitions.

Reluctance of the apex court more concerned with civil law to interfere with the internal affairs of
the Army is likely to create a distorted picture in the minds of the military personnel that persons
subject to Army Act are not citizens of India. It is one of the cardinal features of our Constitution
that a person by enlisting in or entering armed forces does not cease to be a citizen so as to wholly
deprive him of his rights under the Constitution. More so when this Court held in Sunil Batra v.
Delhi Administration & ors. (1) that even prisoners deprived of personal liberty are not wholly
denuded of their fundamental rights. In the larger interest of national security and military
discipline Parliament in its widsom may restrict or abrogate such rights in their application to the
Armed Forces but this process should not be carried so far as to create a class of citizens not entitled
to the benefits of the liberal spirit of the Constitution. Persons subject to Army Act are grity and
wholly unbiased. A marked difference in the procedure A for trial of an offence by the criminal court
and the court martial is apt to generate dissatisfaction arising out of this differential treatment. Even
though it is pointed out that the procedure of trial by court martial is almost analoguous to the
procedure of trial in the ordinary criminal courts, we must recall what Justice William O'Douglas
observed 'that civil trial is held in an atmosphere conducive to the protection of individual rights
while a military trial is marked by the age-old manifest destiny of retributive justice. Very expression
‘court martial’ generally strikes terror in the heart of the person to be tried by it. And somehow or
the other the trial is looked upon with disfavour.'(1) In Reid v. Covart.(2) Justice Black observed at
p. 1174 as under;

"Courts-martial are typically ad hoc bodies appointed by a military officer from
among his subordinates. They have always been subject to varying degrees of
"command influence”. In essence, these tribunals are simply executive tribunals
whose personnel are in the executive chain of command. Frequently, the members of
the court-martial must look to the appointing officer for promotions, advantageous
assignments and efficiency ratings-in short, for their future progress in the service.
Conceding to military personnel that high degree of honesty and sense justice which
nearly all of them undoubtedly have, the members of a court-martial, in the nature of
things, do not and cannot have the independence of jurors drawn from the general

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/278740/ 35Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi Etc vs Union Of India & Others on 25 August, 1982

public or of civilian judges."

Absence of even one appeal with power to review evidence, legal formulation, conclusion and
adequacy or otherwise of punishment is a glaring lacuna in a country where a counterpart civilian
convict can prefer appeal after appeal to hierarchy of courts. Submission that full review of finding
and/or sentence in confirmation procceding under section 153 is provided for is poor solace. A
hierarchy of courts with appellate powers each having its own power of judicial review has of course
been found to be counterproductive but the converse is equally distressing in that there is not even a
single judicial review. With the expanding horizons of fair play in action even in administrative
decision, the universal decleration of human rights and retributive justice being relegated to the
uncivilsed days, a time has come when a step is required to be taken for at least one review and it
must truly be a judicial review as and by way of appeal to a body composed of non-military
personnel or civil personnel. Army is always on alert for repelling external aggression and
supressing internal disorder so that the peace loving citizens enjoy a social order based on rule of
law; the same cannot be denied to the protectors of this order. And it must be realised that an appeal
from Ceaser to Ceaser's wife...confirmation proceeding under section 153 has been condemned as
injudicious and merely a lip sympathy to form. The core question is whether at least there should be
one appeal to a body composed of. non-military personnel and who would enjoy the right of judicial
review both on law and facts as also determine the adequacy of punishment being commensurate
with the gravity of the offence charged. Judicial approach by people well- versed inobjective analysis
of evidence trained by experience to look at facts and law objectively, fair play and justice cannot
always be sacrificed at the alter of military discipline. Unjust decision would be subversive of
discipline. There must be a iudicious admixture of both. And nothing revolutionary is being
suggested. Our Army Act was more or less modelled on the U.K. Act. Three decades of its working
with winds of change blowing over the world necessitate a second look so as to bring it in conformity
with liberty oriented consitution and rule of law which is the uniting and integrating force in our
political society. Even U.K. has taken a step of far reaching importance for rehabilitating the
confidence of the Royal Forces in respect of judicial review of decisions of court-martial. U.K. had
enacted a Court Martial (Appeals) Act of 1951 and it has been extensively amended in Court Martial
(Appeals) Act, 1968. Merely providing an appeal by itself may not be very re- assuring but the
personnel of the appellate court must inspire confidence. The court martial appellate Court consists
of the ex-officio and ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal, such of the judges of the Queen's Bench
. Division as the Lord Chief Justice may nominate after consultation with the Master of the Rolls,
such of the Lords, Commissioners of Justiciary in Scotland as the Lord Chief Justice generally may
nominate, such judges of the Supreme Court of the Northern Ireland as the Lord Chief Justice of
Northern Ireland may nominate and such of the persons of legal experience as the Lord Chancellor
may appoint. The court martial appellate court has power to determine any question necessary to be
determined in order to do justice in the case before the court and may authorise a new trial where
the conviction is quashed in the light of fresh evidence. The court also has power inter alia, to order
production of documents 0; exhibits connected with the proceedings, order the attendance of
witnesses, receive evidence, obtain reports and the like from the members of the court martial or the
person who acted a Judge-Advocate, order a reference of any question to a Special Commissioner
for Inquiry and appoint a person with special expert knowledge to act as an assessor,(1) Frankly the
appellate court has power of full judicial review unhampered by any procedural clap trap.

Turning towards the U.S.A., a reference to Uniform Code of Military Justice Act, 1950. would be
instructive. A provision has been made for setting up of a court of military appeals. The Act
contained many procedural reforms and due process safeguards not then guaranted in civil courts.
To cite one example, the right to legally qualified counsel was made mandatory in general
court-martial cases 13 years before the decision of the Supreme Court in Grdeon v. Wainwriget,(2)
Between 1950 and 1968 when the Administration of Justice Act, 1968, was introduced, many
advances were made in the administration of justice by civil courts but they were not reflected in
military court proceedings. To correct these deficiencies the Congress enacted Military Justice Act,
1968, the salient features of which are: (1) a right to legally qualified counsel guaranteed to an
accused before any special court martial; (2) a military judge can in certain circumstances conduct
the trial alone and the accused in such a situation is given the option after learning the identity of
the military judge of requesting for the trial by the judge alone. A ban has been imposed on
command interference with military justice, etc. Ours is still an antiquated system The wind of
change blowing over the country has not permeated the close and sacrosanct precincts of the Army.
If in civil courts the universally accepted dictum is that justice must not only be done but it must
seem to be done, the same holds good with all the greater vigour in case of court martial where the
judge and the accused done the same dress, have the same mental discipline, have a strong
hierarchical subjugation and a feeling of bias in such circumstances is irremove
able . We, therefore, hope and believe that the changes all over the English speaking democracies
will awaken our Parliament to the changed value system. In this behalf, we would like to draw
pointed attention of the Government to the glaring anomaly that Courts Martial do not even write a
brief reasoned order in support of their conclusion, even in cases in which they impose the death
sentence. This must be remedied in order to ensure that a disciplined and dedicated Indian Army
may not nurse a grievance that the substance of justice and fair play is denied to it.

With these observations we dismiss all the three petitions and vacate all interim orders. There shall
be no order as to costs.

JUDGMENT Santosh Hegde, J.

This appeal by leave of this Court is preferred against judgment and order dated 8th of February
2000 made by the Gauhati High Court in Writ Appeal No. 519 of 1997 confirming an order of the
learned Single Judge of the same court in Civil Rule No.1485 of 1992 dated 19th July 1997. The
original writ petition was filed by the first respondent herein against an award made by the Labour
Court dated 21st of August 1991 which award upheld the decision of the appellant-management to
dismiss the concerned workmen on the ground of proved misconduct.

Facts necessary for the disposal of this appeal are as follows:

Concerned workmen who are represented by the first respondent herein were in the employment of
the appellant- management which was managing a Tea Estate. It is the case of the management that
in pursuance to a demand for bonus of 20% made by the workmen which was not acceded to by the
management, certain workers came in a mob on the night of 12th-13th of October 1980 to the
bungalow of Manager of the Tea Estate, armed with lethal weapons such as lathis, bows and arrows
and axes and they gheraoed the Manager and others and by threat demanded bonus at the rate of
20% as against 8.33% offered by the management. The gherao according to the management
continued till 3.00 AM on 13.10.1980. It is also alleged that on being informed, the police, Bilasipara
arrived at the Estate but the mob consisting the workmen became violent and damaged the
bungalow and other property of the Estate. It is also alleged that during the wrongful confinement of
the Manager, he was compelled to sign a document, agreeing to pay 20% bonus. It is based on the
above allegations, a domestic enquiry was instituted against the concerned workmen and after the
enquiry, on the report of the Enquiry Officer, the workmen concerned were dismissed from service.
Pursuant to the said decision, an application under Section 33 (2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act
(for short, ‘the Act') seeking approval of the Labour Court of the action of the management in
dismissing the concerned workmen was filed. The Labour Court at Gauhati approved the action of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79932/ 1Management Of Krishnakali Tea ... vs Akhil Bharatiya Chah Mazdoor ... on 10 September, 2004

the management in dismissing the concerned workmen on 30th July 1983. Nearly 7 years after the
order of dismissal i.e. on 4.3.1987 a reference under Section 10 of the Act was made by the
concerned Government referring a dispute to adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal, Assam
(Labour Court). The said dispute pertained to the justification of the order of the management in
dismissing the concerned workmen as also to the question of entitlement of the workmen for
re-instatement with full back wages in the event of the Labour Court coming to the conclusion that
the dismissal was not justified. On receipt of the Govt. notification the Labour Court issued notices
to the parties calling upon them to file written statement and documents on which they intended to
rely. Accordingly, the parties filed their written statement and documents.

The case of the management before the Labour Court also, as stated above, is that on the night of
12th and 13th October 1980 the workmen concerned along with others came to the Estate, armed
with deadly weapons and confined the Manager and others from 8.30 PM to 3.00 AM next morning
and it is only after the manager gave it in writing under threat as assurance that 20% bonus would
be paid, the gherao was lifted. Management also stated that these workman caused damage to the
property of the estate.

Workmen in their written statement contended that on the night of 12.10.1980 the Manager of the
Estate by name Shri D.K. Ghosh and one Shri Ratan Babu met some of the workers including one
Benja Lohar being armed with guns. It is stated that the Manager on seeing the workmen got furious
and hit Benja with the butt of his gun on the left side of his head and Ratan Babu hit the other
workmen by name Suko on her right hand, Benja fell unconscious and on hearing the scream of
Suko other workmen came to the aid of the injured workmen and they took them to the garden
seeking first aid to the said injured persons. It is further contended that police personnel guarding
the Manager's bungalow allowed the workmen to enter because of the injuries suffered by Benja and
all the workmen only wanted treatment of the said Benja and the other injured co-worker. They
contended that they were not armed with any lethal weapons nor did they create any untoward
incident. It is due to ulterior motive with a view to get rid of the workmen who were not to the liking
of the manager, the management had initiated the domestic enquiry. They also contended that no
opportunity was given to the workmen to produce evidence or to defend themselves in the domestic
enquiry. They denied that they ever damaged the property of the Estate or illegally confined the
Manager and others inside the Manager's bungalow. They contend that the enquiries by the
domestic tribunal was vindictive, capricious. The Labour Court while considering the preliminary
issue "whether the domestic enquiry was fair and proper" held that the same was not fair and
proper, therefore parties were given opportunities to produce evidence on merits. Labour Court also
noted the fact that the charge framed against the workmen in the enquiry was that:
"on 12th and 13.10.1980 you entered inside the Manager's bungalow from 8.30 PM to 3.00 AM with
lethal weapons in hand along with others in the riotous manner and damaged company's property
and illegally confined the Manager and others inside the Manager's bungalow".

It is relevant to mention at this stage that in regard to the incident which was the subject-matter of
the domestic enquiry, the police had initiated criminal proceedings and in the said proceedings the

accused persons were acquitted for lack of evidence.

The Labour Court after considering the material produced by the parties came to the conclusion that
the allegations of wrongful confinement and extortion of documents stood proved and the defence of
the workmen that the Manager had assaulted the workers Benja and Suko consequent to which a
group of workmen entered the Estate to provide treatment to them was not accepted. The Labour
Court also noticed the fact that out of the 29 dismissed workmen, some had settled the dispute with
the management and have accepted the compensation offered by the management and had left the
services of the management while others who did not accept the settlement were alone proceeded
against. The Court also took note of the fact that the criminal case filed as against some of the
workmen in the criminal court, ended in acquittal but held that the order of the criminal court had
no bearing on the case before it, hence based on the material produced it upheld the dismissal of the
workmen and rejected the prayer of the workmen for reinstatement with full back wages.

Being aggrieved by the said award of the Labour court, the workmen-Union, the first respondent
herein preferred a writ petition before a learned Single Judge of the Gauhati High Court who after
hearing the parties came to the conclusion that the finding of the Labour Court that there was
extortion of documents by the workmen concerned was contrary to the chargesheet which did not
contain such an allegation. It came to the conclusion that allegation of extortion was an
afterthought. It also accepted the defence of the workmen that they entered the Estate only to obtain
treatment of the injured workmen who was assaulted by the Manager of the Estate. It also held that
the Labour Court did not apply its mind to the vital facts and circumstances of the case as alleged by
the learned counsel for the workmen who appeared in the said writ petition. On that basis the
learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that the Labour court did not appreciate the material
on record properly and passed the order justifying the dismissal which is disproportionate to the
offence alleged. It also held that the workmen who were tried before the criminal court were
honorably acquitted by the criminal court and the departmental enquiry held by the management
was faulty. On the said basis it set aside the award and directed the management to (i) reinstate the
surviving workmen who have not attained the age of superannuation with compensation of
Rs.15,000/- to each of them in lieu of back wages; (ii) to pay compensation of Rs.30,000/- to each
of the workers who have superannuated during the pendency of the proceedings upto that Court and
(iii) to fix lump sum compensation in consultation with the petitioner -Union which shall be paid to
the actual heir (wife) of the workmen who expired without getting any benefit. It directed the
management to pay the said compensation within six weeks from the receipt of its judgment.

An appeal filed against the said judgment and order of the learned Single Judge before the Division
Bench of the same Court came to be dismissed. The Appeal Bench held that the Labour Court could
not have gone beyond the charge originally framed by the management in the domestic enquiry.
Therefore, its finding in regard to the charge of extortion was unsustainable in law. It also came to
the conclusion that there was a duty on the part of the Labour Court to have taken into
consideration the findings and the facts recorded in the criminal court which not having been done,
the award could not be sustained. It upheld the learned Single Judge's conclusion that the
punishment of the dismissal of the workmen was disproportionate to the offence actually alleged
against the workmen. It is on that basis the appeal came to be dismissed. As stated above, it is
against the said judgment of the High Court the appellant management is before us in this appeal.

Shri K. R. Choudhary, learned senior counsel addressing arguments on behalf of the appellant
contended that the Labour Court having permitted the parties to adduce evidence in justification or
otherwise of the finding of the domestic tribunal and having recorded evidence in this regard justly
came to the conclusion that the management has established its case of misconduct against the
workmen. He also contended that the finding in regard to the extortion of the documents was not
actually a new charge but was in fact a part of the charge which referred to the wrongful
confinement of the Manager and there being sufficient material before the Labour Court, both in
regard to the long and wrongful confinement of the Manager and other officials of the Estate as also
in regard to the forceful extortion of a document agreeing to pay 20% bonus, the Labour Court was
justified in coming to the conclusion that the workmen were also guilty of the said charge of
extortion. He also contended, assuming for the argument sake that the Labour Court could not have
gone into the question of extortion of the document, the original charge as framed by the domestic
enquiry having clearly stated about the wrongful confinement of the Manager and others and the
damage caused to the property of the Estate by a riotous mob of workmen, carrying deadly weapons,
itself was sufficient to justify the punishment of dismissal. He submitted that the finding and
evidence recorded by the criminal court not binding on the labour court, there was no obligation on
the part of the labour court to have considered the evidence led in the said trial. At any rate, he
submitted that the Labour Court had taken cognizance of the fact that there was a criminal case
which came to be ended in an acquittal. He pointed out that the observations of the learned Single
Judge that the acquittal of the workmen by the criminal court was "honorable acquittal", is wholly
erroneous. He also submitted that on facts and circumstances of the case it is established that the
workmen have indulged in a serious unlawful act which justified the punishment of dismissal. In
support of his arguments, learned counsel has relied on a judgment of this Court in State of
Rajasthan versus B.K. Meena and others [1996 (6) S.C.C. 417].

Shri D.K. Aggarwal, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent-Union contended that the
finding of the Labour Court having gone beyond the charge framed by the management against the
workmen in regard to the allegations of extortion, the same was justly reversed by the High Court.
He placed reliance in support of this contention on the judgment of this Court in the case of The
Workmen of M/s. Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co. of India (Pvt.) Ltd. etc. etc. versus The Management
& Ors. 1973 (1) LLJ 278. He next contended that the Labour Court ought not to have brushed aside
the finding of the criminal court and it was duty bound to have considered the same while
appreciating the evidence adduced in the proceedings before it. In support of this contention, the
learned counsel relied upon a judgment of this Court in the case of Capt. M. Paul Anthony versus
Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. and another AIR 1999 SC 1416. He then contended that assuming for
argument sake that the workmen did indulge in some sort of gherao, since there is no evidence as to
specific overt act assigned to the dismissed workmen, the punishment of dismissal was totally
disproportionate to the misconduct alleged. He relied on a judgment of this court in the case of M/s.
Burn & Co. Limited versus Their workmen and others AIR 1959 SC 529.

Bearing in mind the arguments addressed before us and findings of the High Court, we will now
consider the various arguments addressed before us in this appeal. In that process we will first take
up the contention of the respondent that the finding of the Labour Court is vitiated by the fact that it
took into consideration a misconduct which was not part of the charge memo issued to the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79932/ 4Management Of Krishnakali Tea ... vs Akhil Bharatiya Chah Mazdoor ... on 10 September, 2004

workmen, and the Labour Court went beyond the charges framed therefore the conclusion of the
Labour court as to justification of the punishment is vitiated by irrelevant consideration, and the
High Court was justified in interfering with the said finding.

It is true in the charge memo issued to the concerned workmen extortion was not shown as one of
the acts of misconduct. The original charge memo contained the following charge:

" (4) On 12.10.80/13.10.80 you entered inside the Manager's bungalow from 8.30 PM to 3.00 AM
with lethal weapons in hand along with others in a riotous manner and damaged company's
property and illegally confined Manager and others inside the Manager's bungalow. You also used
abusive language.

(2) This if proved is an offence under standing orders 10(a)(7), 10(a)(8) and 10(a) 11 in force on this
Estate"

The Labour Court in its award on a preliminary point held that the enquiry conducted by the
management was not a proper enquiry hence based on the requests made in the statement filed
before it, permitted the management to adduce evidence in support of its charge in the proceedings
before it and also permitted the workmen to adduce evidence in defence. In the course of the
evidence adduced by the parties a specific allegation that the workmen demanded a promise in
writing from the Manager of the Estate to give 20% bonus was in fact made and that on police
officer having informed that it will not be possible to control the situation unless such a promise was
given by the Manager in writing a document to the effect was given by the Manager under threat and
that only after receipt of the said document workers dispersed, at about 3.00 AM on 13th October
1980, was made. The Labour Court having considered the evidence led by the Management in this
regard as also the counter evidence led by the workmen came to the conclusion that such an
extortion of letter under threat was actually obtained.

Learned counsel appearing for the respondent-workmen, relied upon the judgment of this Court in
Laxmi Devi Sugar Mills Ltd. versus Nand Kishore Singh [1956 Vol.II LLJ 439] wherein it was held:

"But in view of the fact that the concerned workman was chargesheeted only for instigating his
fellow-workmen to demand for removal of the general manager and not for any other act of
insubordination, the management could not be permitted to dismiss himU.The prayer of the
management for permission to dismiss such workmen could not be allowed to be justified on any
grounds or charges other than those mentioned in the chargesheet.

 

The concerned workman not having been charged with the act of insubordination which could have
really justified the management in dismissing him, the employer could not take advantage of the
same even though those acts could be brought home to him in proper proceedings."

Based on the above decision of this Court in the said case, an argument is addressed on behalf of the
respondent- workmen that the Labour Court could not have justified the dismissal of the workmen

on the basis of an allegation of extortion which was not a part of the charges framed. It is to be noted

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79932/ 5Management Of Krishnakali Tea ... vs Akhil Bharatiya Chah Mazdoor ... on 10 September, 2004

herein that in the instant case in the statements filed by the management before the Labour Court,
act of extortion was mentioned as one of the facts leading to misconduct which was supported by the
evidence led by the management before the Labour Court. Though no specific charge/issue was
framed in this regard against the concerned workmen but the workmen in their statement had
denied the same. Therefore, the parties were well aware that the extortion of a letter promising 20%
bonus from the Manager was one of the facts in the chain of events involved in the incident of 12th
and 13th of October 1980. The Labour Court found, among other facts, this fact of extortion as also
having been proved. The question then is: can a finding of justification of a punishment awarded by
the management based on an additional fact though proved by evidence but not mentioned in the
charge can be maintained. It is well-settled that Rules of Procedure found in the Code of Criminal
Procedure are not strictly applicable to the proceedings before the Labour Court but the Labour
Court can always rely on legal principles found in the provisions of the Code to modulate its
procedure. Section 215 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads thus : "215. Effect of errors. No
error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge, and no
omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any stage of the case as
material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has occasioned a
failure of justice."

From the above, it is seen that even in a criminal trial if there are omissions to state a particular
offence in the charge, that by itself does not occasion a failure of justice unless the accused satisfies
the court that by such omission he was in fact misled and the same has occasioned a failure of
justice. In the instant case, as noted above, in the statements filed by the Management before the
Labour Court, this act of extortion is specifically alleged and in the reply statement of the workmen,
the same is specifically denied and parties have led evidence in regard to their respective cases on
the question of extortion, therefore, it cannot be said that the workmen were misled by the omission
to mention the charge of extortion. Having joined issue on this question of fact, they cannot also
plead that they have been in any manner prejudiced by the said omission or misled by such
omission nor can they contend that the said omission has occasioned a failure of justice.

Be that as it may, since this Court in the case of Laxmi Devi Sugar Mills Ltd. (supra), has stated that
the Management cannot be permitted to justify the punishment on grounds of charges other than
those mentioned in the chargesheet, we would leave this issue at that.

But what is stated by us hereinabove would not in any manner, vitiate the ultimate justification of
the dismissal order as held by the Labour Court. It is to be noticed that the charge memo issued to
the workmen has in specific terms stated that the workmen concerned on 12th [13th October, 1980
entered the Manager's bungalow, armed with deadly weapons, caused damage to the property of the
estate and illegally confined the Manager and others between 8.30 p.m. on 12th October till 3 a.m.
on 13th October, 1980. This allegation as found in the charge memo has also been found to be
proved by the Labour Court. Therefore, the question for our consideration is: whether this finding as
alleged in the chargesheet by itself is sufficient to justify the order of dismissal without the support
of the allegation of extortion. On this aspect of the case the decision of this Court in Laxmi Devi
Sugar Mills Ltd. (supra) will not assist the respondents’ case. In that case, the only charge against
the workman was that he instigated the other workmen to demand the removal of the General

 

 

 

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79932/ 6Management Of Krishnakali Tea ... vs Akhil Bharatiya Chah Mazdoor ... on 10 September, 2004

Manager which charge was not proved in the enquiry, then the management tried to justify the
removal by adducing evidence on other allegations in regard to which there was no charge, in those
factual situation this Court held such justification based uncharged allegation was impermissible.

In the case in hand, the facts are different, the charge contained the allegation of riotous behaviour,
causing damage to the property and wrongful confinement, these charges were held to be proved the
additional fact of extortion though factually proved was outside the charge, hence, we will have to
consider whether charges proved, other than that of extortion is sufficient to confirm the approval of
dismissal of the workmen. From the facts noticed hereinabove, it is seen that on the night between
12th and 13th of October, 1980, the concerned workmen entered the Estate armed with deadly
weapon caused damage to the property of the Estate and wrongfully confined the Manager and
others between 8.30 PM on 12th to 3.00 AM on 13th of next day. These facts which are mentioned in
the Charge-Memo and held proved establishes misconducts alleged against the concerned workmen
in the Charge-Memo, in this back ground even proceeding on the basis that the allegation of
extortion has not been legally established and ought not to be considered as a misconduct, in our
opinion, the other misconducts of causing damage to the property Gherao and wrongfully confining
the Manager and others for a long period are by themselves sufficient to come to the conclusion that
the concerned workmen have indulged in misconduct punishable under the standing orders
applicable to them. The allegation of extortion though being a part of the continuing act of
misconducts is severable from the other allegations, on the basis of the finding of the Labour Court
the allegations alleged the concerned workmen can be accepted without reference to its finding on
the allegation of extortion.

The next contention addressed on behalf of the respondents is that the Labour Court ought not to
have brushed aside the finding of the criminal court which according to the learned Single Judge
‘honorably’ acquitted the workmen- accused of the offence before it. We have been taken through
the said judgment of the criminal court and we must record that there was such ‘honorable’ acquittal
by the criminal court. The acquittal by the criminal court was based on the fact that the prosecution
did not produce sufficient material to establish its charge which is clear from the following
observations found in the judgment of the criminal court:

"Absolutely in the evidence on record of the prosecution witnesses I have found nothing against the
accused persons. The prosecution totally fails to prove the charges under Sections 147, 353, 329 IPC"

Learned counsel for the respondents in regard to the above contention relied on a judgment of this
Court in the case of Capt. M. Paul Anthony (supra). In our opinion, even that case would not support
the respondents herein because in the said case the evidence led in the criminal case, as well as in
the domestic enquiry was one and the same and the criminal case having acquitted the workmen on
the very same evidence, this Court came to the conclusion that the finding to the contrary on the
very same evidence by the domestic enquiry would be unjust, unfair and rather oppressive. It is to
be noted in that case the finding by the tribunal was arrived in an ex parte departmental proceeding.
In the case in hand, we have noticed before the Labour Court the evidence led by the management
was different from that led by the prosecution in the criminal case and the materials before the
criminal court and the Labour Court were entirely different. Therefore, it was open to the Labour

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79932/ 7Management Of Krishnakali Tea ... vs Akhil Bharatiya Chah Mazdoor ... on 10 September, 2004

Court to have come to an independent conclusion de hors the finding of the criminal court. But at
this stage it should be noted that it is not as if the Labour Court in the instant case was totally
oblivious of the proceedings before the criminal court. The Labour Court has in fact perused the
order of the Judicial Magistrate and the exhibits produced therein and came to an independent
conclusion that the order of the criminal case has no bearing on the proceedings before it which
finding of the Labour Court, in our opinion, is justified. It may be some use to us to refer at this
stage to a judgment of this Court in the case of State of Rajasthan (supra) wherein it is held thus :

"There is yet another reason. The approach and the objective in the criminal proceedings and the
disciplinary proceedings is altogether distinct and different. In the disciplinary proceedings, the
question is whether the respondent is guilty of such conduct as would merit his removal from
service or a lesser punishment, as the case may be, whereas in the criminal proceedings the question
is whether the offences registered against him under the Prevention of Corruption Act (and the
Indian Penal Code, if any) are established and, if established, what sentence should be imposed
upon him. The standard of proof, the mode of enquiry and the rules governing the enquiry and trial
in both the cases are entirely distinct and differentL"

 

 

 

 

 

From the above, it is seen that the approach and the objectives of the criminal proceedings and the
disciplinary proceedings are altogether distinct and different. The observations therein indicate that
the Labour Court is not bound by the findings of the criminal court.

Even the reliance placed in the case of M/s. Burn & Co. (supra), in our opinion, does not assist the
workmen in this appeal. That was a case where this Court came to the conclusion that there was no
dependable evidence against the individual workman who has incited the workers to participate in
the strike. In such circumstances, the Court came to the conclusion that in the absence of any
evidence individually implicating the workmen concerned an omnibus allegation against all
workmen cannot be used to punish only some workmen. Such is not the situation in the facts of this
case wherein we have noticed that the tribunal has come to the conclusion that the concerned
workmen had participated in the gherao armed with deadly weapons and caused damage to the
property of the Estate and wrongfully confined the Manager and others for nearly 8 hrs. Therefore,
it found all those workmen who took part in the said incident guilty of the misconduct.

This leaves us to consider whether the punishment of dismissal awarded to the concerned workmen
de hors the allegation of extortion is disproportionate to the misconduct proved against them. From
the evidence proved, we find the concerned workmen entered the estate armed with deadly weapons
with a view to gherao the Manager and others in that process they caused damage to the property of
the estate and wrongfully confined the Manager and others from 8.30 p.m. on 12th of October to 3
a.m. on the next day. These charges, in our opinion, are grave enough to attract the punishment of
dismissal even without the aid of the allegation of extortion. The fact that the Management entered
into settlement with some of the workmen who were also found guilty of the charge would not, in
any manner, reduce the gravity of the misconduct in regard to the workmen concerned in this
appeal because these workmen did not agree with the settlement which others are agreed instead
chose to question the punishment.

the lower court is restored. The appeal is allowed.

HEADNOTE:

The Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay published a
resolution under s. 354R of the Bombay Municipal Corporation
Act, 1888, declaring a certain area to be a clearance area.
After the expiry of the period within which persons affected
by it had to lodge objections thereto, the Corporation
submitted a clearance order to the State Government, under

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 1Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

s. 354RA for confirmation. After confirmation an agreement
was entered into between the Corporation and the landlords
of certain buildings in the clearance area for the
demolition of those buildings. The tenants therein, filed a
suit in the City Civil Court against the Corporation and
landlords contending that : (i) ss. 354R and 354RA were
ultra vires as they did not provide for the giving of an
opportunity to the tenants to show that the premises did not
require to be demolished, and (ii) the action of defendants
was mala fide because it was taken under unconstitutional
provisions and also because no opportunity was -given to
them to object to the proposed action. The suit was
dismissed on the ground that the only remedy of the
plaintiffs was to file an appeal against the clearance order
to the Judge, City Civil Court, under Schedule GG, cl. (2)
of the Act. An appeal to the High Court was also dismissed
but in Letters Patent Appeal, the High Court remitted the
matter to the trial Court, after allowing the plaintiffs to
amend the plaint. By the amendment the plaintiffs shifted
their ground by saying that the landlords wrongfully and
fraudulently induced the Corporation to make the order. The
Court also gave directions for taking additional evidence
and for examining certain specified persons as witnesses.
The Corporation appealed to the Supreme Court.

HELD : (i) The interest of the tenants in the demised
premises is property within the meaning of Art. 19 (1) (f)
of the Constitution. Since however, s. 354RA and Schedule
GG afford opportunities to them to object to a clearance
order, it follows that the restrictions on the tenants
right to hold property, enacted by ss. 354R and 354RA, are
not unreasonable and that the provisions are valid. [554 C;
558 D-E].

(ii) Upon the view that the sections are valid, it must
further follow that it was open to the plaintiffs to prefer
an appeal under Schedule GG cl. (2) to the Judge, City Civil
Court as the tenants were "persons aggrieved" within the
meaning of the clause. Finality is given to a_ clearance
order after its confirmation by the Government and its
publication, subject only to the result of an appeal so
preferred. If no such appeal was

543

preferred or if such appeal was filed and dismissed no
remedy by suit was available to a person like a tenant whose

contention was that he was aggrieved by a clearance
order. L558 E-G].
(iii) The High Court was in error in allowing the

amendment to the plaint and in remitting the suit for a
virtual retrial[552 F].

By the amendment, the -plaintiffs were making out a new case
of fraud for which there was not the slightest basis in the
plaint. Also the power under 0. XLI, r.27 of the
code, was only for removing a lacuna in the evidence and did
not entitle the High Court to let in fresh evidence at the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

appellate stage, where even without such evidence it could
pronounce judgment in the case. Further, the High Court
should not have given directions for examining specified
persons as it was beyond its competence to virtually oblige
a party to examine any particular witness. [547 F; 548 G-H;
552 G-H].

JUDGMENT :

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 134 of 1964 Appeal by special leave from the
judgement and order dated September 28, 1962, of the Bombay High Court in L. P. Appeal No. 85 of
1961.

M. C. Setalvad and J.B. Dadachanji, for the appellant. s. V. Gupte, Additional Solicitor-General, G.
A. Pandaya and M. 1. Khowaja, for respondents Nos. 7, 8 and 9. l. N. Shroff for respondent No. 4.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Mudholkar J. The question which falls for decision in
appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Bombay is whether the suit instituted by the
plaintiffs in the City Civil Court, Bombay, was maintainable. The plaintiffs are some of the tenants
occupying different rooms in a group of buildings known as Dhobi Chawls (and also known as the
Colaba Land Mill Chawls) situate on Lala Nigam Road, Colaba, Bombay- There are a large number
of other tenants also who reside or carry on business in these Chawls and the plaintiffs instituted a
suit in a representative capacity on behalf of all the tenants. The first defendant to the suit is the
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay and the remainmg defendants 2 to 4 are landlords of the
plaintiffs. The buildings and the land on which they stand belong to the Colaba Land Mill Co., Ltd.,
Bombay. Under an agreement dated May 16, 1956 called the Demolition Agreement defendants 2 to
4 undertook for a certain consideration to demolish the buildings which are admittedly in a
dilapidated condition after taking the permission of the Rent Controller, Bombay. Under cl. 7 of that
agreement defendants 2 to 4 were to be put in possession of the buildings and land on which they
stand, with leave and licence of the Company and were liable to pay Rs. 20,221-8-0 p.a. to the
Company till the demolition of the buildings and thereafter they were to hold the land as tenants at
will of the Company. Until the demolition of the buildings, defendants 2 to 4 were entitled to the
rents payable by the tenants occupying the buildings and were liable to pay monthly taxes, insurance
premia and other dues payable in respect of the buildings. After the demolition of the buildings
defendants 2 to 4 were entitled to all the materials and debris but had to pay Rs. 40,000 as the price
thereof to the Company. Out of this amount these defendants had to pay and had actually paid Rs.
10,000 at the time of the agreement.

The plaintiffs’ contention is that the buildings were in a dilapidated condition for a number of years
and that between August 1951 and May 1956 as many as 138 notices were served on the Company
for effecting repairs to the buildings but they took no action whatsoever in this regard. The plaintiffs
further say that between November 1956 and January 29, 1960, eleven notices were served on
defendants 2 to 4 for the same purpose but no action was taken by them either on those notices.
Further the Company and defendants 2 to 4 were prosecuted 71 times for not complying with the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 3Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

notices but even these prosecutions proved ineffective. Their contention is that the Company as also
defendants 2 to 4 deliberately refrained from carrying out the repairs because they wanted to
demolish the buildings and in order to facilitate the attainment of this object they invited various
notices issued by the Corporation and the prosecutions launched by it.

The plaintiffs admit that the Corporation, in exercise of the powers conferred by S. 354R of the
Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 (hereafter referred to as the Act) have declared the area in
which the buildings stand as a clearance area and under s. 354RA of that Act made a clearance order
which has been duly confirmed by the State Government. According to them, however, these
provisions are ultra vires of Arts. 19 (1 ) (f) and (g) ,of the Constitution. Further, according to them
the first defen- dant has abused the provisions of the Act and that the action taken by it is mala fide.
No particulars of mala fides have, however, been set out in the plaint. The defendants denied that
the aforesaid provisions are ultra vires and also denied that the Order was made mala fide. They
further contended that the present suit was barred by virtue of the provisions of cl. (2) of Schedule
GG to the Act and was also barred by time.

The trial court dismissed the suit mainly upon the ground that it war, not tenable. An appeal was
taken by the plaintiffs to the High Court which was dismissed summarily by Datar J., on August 25,
1961. On the same day the plaintiffs preferred an appeal under the letters patent which went up
before a Division Bench consisting of Patel and Palekar JJ. The learned Judges permitted the
plaintiffs to amend the plaint overruling the objections of the defendants. In their judgment the
learned Judges held that the suit was not barred. Then they proceeded to consider the question of
mala fides. According to them the plaintiffs had pleaded mala fides but that they had omitted to give
particulars. They also observed that it was true that no evidence was led by the plaintiffs before the
trial court and ordinarily they would not have been entitled to lead fresh evidence at that stage,
much less so at the stage of the appeal under letters patent. According to them, however, it is not
possible to dispose of the case on the material on record, that there are certain documents on record
which, if unexplained, "support in a large measure the contention of the plaintiffs that defendants 2,
3 and 4 obtained an order by fraud and also that the order was mala fide." After referring to some of
these documents they observed: "Though therefore no evidence is led on the question of mala fides
or fraud committed upon them, it prima facie leads to such an inference, and it would not be proper
to decide the question without requiring further evidence." This observation was followed by
another which, we think, is a very unusual one. It is this : "We particularly want the Commissioner
and the City Engineer and the defendants to be examined on this question." Eventually, the learned
Judges remitted the case to the, City Civil Court for recording additional evidence and directed that
Court to certify the evidence and its findings by the end of November, 1962. After the grant of
special leave to the appellants the proceedings before the City Civil Court have been stayed.

We must first address ourselves to the question as to whether the High Court was justified in
permitting the amendment to the plaint. By that amendment the plaintiffs have added paragraph 8A
to the plaint. There they have purported to summarise the correspondence which took place
between the plaintiffs and the officers of the Corporation and between the landlords and the
Corporation. Then they have stated as follows "In the premises the plaintiffs say that the defendants
2, 3 and 4 have fraudulently and wrongfully induced the ist defendant to make the said order. In the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 4Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

alternative and in any event the plaintiffs say that as defendants 2, 3 and 4 have derised (sic) their
responsibility to provide accommodation to all the tenants in the new buildings intended to be
constructed on the site, the plaintiffs will submit that the approval of the Improve- ment Committee
to the said order and the subsequent confirmation thereof by the Municipal Corporation and
Government was given under a mistake of fact and under circumstances not warranted by the
provisions of section 354R and of the law. In the circumstances the plaintiffs submit that the said
orders passed by the ist defendant under section 354R have been passed in utter disregard and in
violation of the strict provisions of the said section. The plaintiffs submit that the ist defendant
failed and neglected before making the said order to take any measures whether by arrangement of
the programme of otherwise to ensure that as little hardship as possible was inflicted on the tenants.
The plaintiffs accordingly submit that the said orders are illegal, invalid and void."

In the plaint as originally filed, in paragraph 9 they have said the following on the question of mala
fides :

"The plaintiffs submit that the action sought to be taken is a clear abuse of the provisions of the
Bombay Municipal Corporation Act and as such ultra vires the powers conferred upon the defendant
No. 1 by the said Act. The plaintiffs, therefore, submit that the action of the defendant No. 1 is mala
fide."

In the earlier paragraphs the plaintiffs have challenged the validity of ss. 354R and 354RA on the
grounds that they confer untrammelled and uncontrolled executive discretion upon the Corporation
and its officers and also upon the ground that they are violative of the plaintiffs’ rights under Art. 19
(4) (f) and (g) of the Constitution. They have not indicated why the making of the clearance order by
the Corporation was an abuse of the provisions of the Act. No doubt, later in paragraph 9 they say
that the Corporation failed to give a hearing to the plaintiffs and that had they been given an
opportunity they would have satisfied the Corporation that the premises in question did not require
to be pulled down. While therefore, it is true that the plaintiffs have characterised the action of the
Corporation as mala fide the grounds upon which the action is characterised as mala fide appear, to
be (a) the unconstitutionality of the provisions of S. 354R and 354RA and (b) failure of the
Corporation to give an opportunity to the plaintiffs to satisfy its officers that the premises did not
require to be demolished. By the amendment made by them in pursuance of the order of the High
Court they have shifted their ground by saying that the landlords have fraudulently and wrongfully
induced the Corporation to make the order and plead alternatively that as the landlords have denied
their responsibility to provide accommodation to all the tenants in the new building intended to be
constructed on the site, a clearance order could not properly be made by the Corporation. It was
urged before us by Mr. Setalvad that an entirely new case has been made out in the amendment and
that the plaintiffs did so at the suggestion of the Court. In support of his contention he also referred
to the objection of Mr. S. V. Gupte before the High Court to the effect that the plaintiffs had not
made an application for the amendment of the plaint. He further, relying upon a reference in the
judgment, said that the amendment proposed by the plaintiffs was not found by the Court to be
adequate and that it was at the instance of the Court that the plaintiffs proposed the amendment
which now actually finds place as para 8A of the plaint. There appears to be good foundation for
what Mr. Setalvad says but merely because an amendment was sought by the plaintiffs at the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 5Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

suggestion of the court it would not be proper for us to disallow it unless there are grounds for
holding that it was forced upon an unwilling party. That is, however, not the suggestion. For, the
court wanting to do justice may invite the attention of the parties to defects in pleadings so that they
could be remedied and the real issue between the parties tried. There is, however, another ground
and a stronger one which impels us to hold that the amendment should never have been allowed.
That ground is that the plaintiffs are now making out a case of fraud for which there is not the
slightest basis in the plaint as it originally stood. The mere use of the word mala fide in the plaint
cannot afford any basis for permitting an amendment. The context in which the word mala fide is
used in the plaint clearly shows that what the plaintiffs meant was that the order of the Corporation
having been made in exercise of arbitrary powers and ‘having the result of adversely affecting the
plaintiffs' rights under Art. 19 (1 ) (f) and (g) of the Constitution amounted to an abuse of the
provisions of the Act and was thus made mala fide.

The High Court was quite alive to the requirement of law that party should not be allowed to make
out a new case by way of an amendment to the pleading. Dealing with this matter the High Court
has observed :

"This brings us to the course which we must adopt in the present case and the
amendment application. In the plaint, the plaintiff alleged that the order was mala
fide and that it was obtained for collateral purposes."

The learned Judges were not correct in observing that it was the plaintiffs’ case in the plaint that the
landlords had obtained the clearance order or that the Corporation had made that order for a
collateral purpose. This impression of the High Court seems to be the basis of the rather curious
procedure which it chose to follow in this case. Then the High Court referred to the fact that no
evidence whatsoever had been led by the plaintiffs before the City Civil Court to the effect that the
order was passed fraudulently or for a collateral purpose. It was alive to the fact that in such a case a
party should not be allowed to adduce fresh evidence at the appellate stage and much less so at the
stage of letters patent appeal. Then it observed :

"If the case had rested thus the matter would have been very simple apart from the
amendment application. It seems to us however that it is not possible to dispose of
this case satisfactorily on the material on record. There are some documents on
record which if unexplained support in a large measure the contention of the
plaintiffs that defendants 2, 3 and 4 obtained the order by fraud and also that the
order was mala fide."

If the High Court, in making these observations, was referring to the provisions of 0. XLI, r. 27,
Code of Civil Procedure it ought not to have overlooked the mandatory provisions of cl. (b) of sub-r.
(1) of r. 27. No doubt, under r. 27 the High Court has the power to allow a document to be produced
and a witness to be examined. But the requirement of the High Court must be limited to those cases
where it found it necessary to obtain such evidence for enabling it to pronounce judgment. This
provision does not entitle the High Court to let in fresh evidence at the appellate stage where even
without such evidence it can pronounce judgment in a case. It does not entitle the appellate court to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 6Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

let in fresh evidence only for the purpose of pronouncing judgment in a particular way. In other
words, it is only for removing a lacuna in the evidence that the appellate court is empowered to
admit additional evidence. The High Court does not say that there is any such lacuna in this case. On
the other hand what it says is that certain documentary evidence on record supports "in a large
measure" the plaintiffs' contention about fraud and mala fides. We shall deal with these documents
presently but before that we must point out that the power under cl. (b) of sub-r. (1) of r. 27 cannot
be exercised for adding to the evidence already on record except upon one of the grounds specified
in the provision. If the documents on record are relevant on the issue of fraud the court could well
proceed to consider them and decide the issue. The observations of the High Court that certain
documents would support the plaintiffs' contention of fraud only if they were not explained would
show that according to it they furnish a prima facie evidence of fraud. There is nothing to show that
the defendants or any of them wanted to be afforded an opportunity for explaining the documents.
It would further appear that it was not merely for the limited purpose of affording the defendants an
opportunity to explain the documents that the High Court remitted the case to the City Civil Court.
For, in the concluding portion of its judgment the High Court has directed as follows :

"in the result, we remit the case to the City Civil Court for receiving additional
evidence as directed by us in the judgment and also to allow evidence on the
amendment. We direct that the defendants do file their written statement within
three weeks from today, or at such earlier time as they can in answer to the
amendment permitted to be made. Discovery and inspection forthwith within a week
thereafter. And after this formality is over, the case to be on the board for final
hearing for taking evidence on the issue of mala fide and the issues that arise on the
amended pleadings between the parties........ "

This clearly shows that what the High Court has in substance done is to order a fresh trial. Such a
course is not permissible under 0. XLI, r. 27, Code of Civil Procedure. The High Court has quite
clearly not proceeded under 0. XLI, r. 25 because it has not come to the conclusion that the City
Civil Court had omitted to frame or try an issue or to determine the question of fact which was
essential to the right decision of a suit. For, the High Court has not indicated which issue was not
tried by the trial court. If the High Court meant that the necessary issue had not been raised by the
trial court though such issue was called for in the light of the pleadings, the High Court is required
under this rule to frame the additional issue and then remit it for trial to the City Civil Court. Finally,
this is not a case which was decided by the trial court on any preliminary point and, therefore, a
general remand such as is permissible under r. 23 could not be ordered.

The only documents to which the High Court has referred in its judgment as supporting the
plaintiffs’ allegations of fraud and mala fides are the letter, dated September 3, 1959 which the City
Engineer wrote to the Tenants’ Association and the letter, dated September 11, 1959 which the
Commissioner wrote to the Improvements Committee. In the first of these letters the City Engineer
had stated that the landlords had agreed to construct a building consisting of single room tenements
for the purpose of letting out at standard rents and that the landlords were taking the responsibility
for providing either alternative accommodation to bona fide residents by shifting them temporarily
to other premises or by arranging a phased programme of demolition and construction as may be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 7Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

found convenient. How this letter can afford any evidence of fraud or mala fides it is difficult to
appreciate. It is not disputed before us that the landlords had constructed some chawls at Kurla and
that they had offered to house the tenants of the Dhobi Chawls in the Kurla Chawls temporarily. It
was also not disputed that the landlords had agreed to construct, after the demolition work was
over, new buildings in which the present tenants would be afforded accommodation at standard
rents. Paragraph 3 of the letter of September 11, 1959 quoted by the High Court in its judgment
mentions that a representation was received from the tenants to the effect that the landlord should
construct a new structure near about the clearance area instead of asking the tenants to go to the
Kurla Chawls. But their demand cannot be regarded as reasonable. The landlords are not shown to
own any land in the neighbourhood. The correspondence through which we were taken by Mr.
Setalvad abundantly shows that land values are very high in Colaba and range between Rs. 250 and
Rs. 275 per sq. ft., and the landlords could not be reasonably expected to buy land for the purpose.
Moreover, there is nothing to show that any vacant building site was available in the neighbourhood
of Dhobi Chawls at the relevant time.

The High Court observed in its judgment that it was only after the scheme was finally approved by
the Corporation, confirmed by the State Government and the final orders made by the City Civil
Court became operative that the City Engineer wrote to the Tenants’ Association stating that no
undertaking was given by the landlord. The High Court had apparently in mind the letter, dated
April 1, 1960 sent by the City Engineer to the Tenants Association which is described in the paper
book as item No. 38. That letter reads thus "Gentlemen, Reference : your letter No. Nil, dated 19th
February, 1960. The landlord of the above mentioned property has undertaken the responsibility of
providing alternative accommodation to bona fide residential tenants at standard rent by
constructing a building on one of the plots viz., plot No. 7 at the same site. The question of making
the site available for the construction of the said building, either by the tenants shifting temporarily
to other place or by the landlord arranging a phased programme of demolition and construction, it
is a matter which should be mutually arranged by the landlord and the tenants. The Municipality
would facilitate towards arriving at any such arrangement between the two parties as indicated by
you, no undertaking has been obtained by -the Municipality from the landlord for any phased
programme of demolition of the chawls. The landlord will be required to demolish the chawls in
compliance with the Clearance Order after the same becomes operative.

As there is no sufficient open space available at the above property, it does not seem feasible to
provide temporary accommodation for the tenants at the same site. If the tenants are not ina
position to make their own arrangement to shift from the place, they should temporarily shift to
tenants (sic) at Kurla offered to them by the landlord with a view to facilitate speedy construction of
the proposed building.

Yours faithfully, Sd/
This letter, far from showing that either the Corporation or the landlords had gone back on the
assurance of providing the tenants alternative accommodation, reaffirms it. No doubt it says that no
undertaking was obtained by the municipality from the landlords to the effect that a phased

programme of demolition of the chawls would be followed. This, the City Engineer pointed out, was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 8Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

a matter of negotiation between the landlords on the one hand and the tenants on the other. Having
made alternative Sup.C.I./65-10 arrangements for housing the tenants temporarily there was no
further responsibility either on the Corporation or on the landlords to do anything more. The High
Court, however, thought otherwise and observed : "Though therefore no evidence is led on the
question of mala fides or fraud it prima facie leads to such an inference and it is not proper to decide
the question without further evidence." It will be repeating ourselves to say that in these
circumstances the High Court had no powers to admit additional evidence or to direct additional
evidence being taken.

Mr. Shroff who appears for the plaintiffs has referred us to two reports of architects in which the
architects have stated that repairs to the buildings would cost Rs. 2 lacs whereas new buildings
would cost Rs. 3 lacs and that, therefore, the best thing for the landlords to do was to approach the
Corporation for making a clearance order so that they could eventually construct new buildings on
the site. According to learned counsel this circumstance, taken with .the fact that there was
deliberate avoidance by the landlords and the owners of the Colaba Land Mill Co., Ltd., to comply
with the notice of the Corporation to undertake repairs, goes to show collusion between the
landlords and the Corporation and that, therefore, it cannot be said that there was no material on
record in support of the plea of fraud set out in paragraph 8A. Apart from the fact that the High
Court has not referred to this material it is sufficient to observe that though the landlords, may have
deliberately allowed the buildings to become unfit 'for human occupation or a danger to the safety of
the tenants occupying them, these matters do not indicate any collusion between the landlords and
the Corporation. We are, therefore, of the view that the High Court was in error in allowing the
amendment to the plaint and in remitting the suit to the trial court for a virtual retrial. The High
Court, however, did not rest content with this order but further directed "we particularly want the
Commissioner and the City Engineer and the defendants to be examined on this question"-the
question being the breach of an assurance given to the tenants. In making this direction the High
Court may have been actuated by a laudable motive but we think it ought to have borne in mind the
limits which the law places upon the powers of the Court in dealing with a case before it. Just as it is
not open to a court to compel a party to make a particular kind of pleading or to amend his pleading
so also it is beyond its competence to virtually oblige a party to ,examine any particular witness. No
doubt, what the High Court ,has said is not in terms a peremptory order but the parties could
possibly not take the risk of treating it otherwise. While, therefore, it is the duty of a court of law not
only to do justice but to ensure that justice is done it should bear in mind that it must act only
according to law, not otherwise. The question then is whether we should send back the matter to the
High Court for deciding the question of the vires of ss. 354R and 354RA. It will be remembered that
the High Court has not given a finding on this point. We would ordinarily have sent back the case to
the High Court for deciding the point. But bearing in mind the fact that the clearance order was
made by the Corporation as long ago as May 7, 1959 and confirmed by the State Government on
January 23, 1960 and also the possibility of the appeal not being dealt with within a reasonable time
by the High: .Court on account of the congestion of work there, we thought it appropriate to hear the
parties on this point as well and to decide. it ourselves.

The contention of Mr. Shroff is briefly this. The plaintiffs an& those who are occupying the buildings
have an interest in them,, by reason of the fact that they are tenants. As a result of the clearance

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 9Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

order they are liable to be evicted from their respective tenements. Therefore, he contends, the
Corporation could not make such an order without giving them an opportunity of showing cause
against it. According to him, the provisions of ss. 354R and 354RA do not contemplate an
opportunity to be given to the tenants before a clearance order is passed and, therefore, the
provisions are ultra vires. Further, according to him, their suit is -not barred by virtue of the
provisions of cl. (2) of Schedule GG, because they cannot be said to be "persons aggrieved" by the
clearance order. They, therefore, did not have a right to prefer an appeal before a Judge of the City
Civil Court, Bombay from that order. He also points out that the Bombay Rents Hotel and .Lodging
House Rates Control Act, 1947 has placed restrictions on the right of a landlord of a house situated
in an area like the City of Bombay to which the Act extends, to evict a tenant therefrom by enacting
in s. 12 that a tenant shall not ordinarily be evicted as long as he pays the standard rent and
permitted increases' whatever may have been the duration of his tenancy, under the original
agreement. A right conferred by this provision on the tenant exists independently of the landlord's
right to own and possess property and this right could not be interfered with or derogated from by
the Corporation by making a clearance order behind the back of the tenant. He admits that under cl.
(hh) of' sub-s. (1) of s. 13 a landlord will be entitled to recover possession of the premises from the
tenant on the ground that they are required by a local authority or other competent authority. But,
he argues, this provision furnishes another reason for the tenant being afforded an opportunity by
the Act to show cause against a proposed clearance scheme which affects or is likely to affect him
inasmuch as he will be bound by the clearance order in a proceeding undertaken by the landlord
under S. 13(1) of the Act for recovery of possession of the demised premises on the strength of that
order. We have no doubt that a tenant has both under the Transfer of Property Act and under S. 12
of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 an interest in the demised
premises which squarely falls within the expressions property occurring in sub-cl. (f) of cl. (2) of Art.
19 of the Constitution. The right which a tenant enjoys under this sub-clause is, however, subject to
the provisions of cl. (5) of Art. 19 which, among other things, provides that the right recognised by
the sub-clause does not affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, ,or prevent
the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights
conferred by the said sub-clauses in the interests of the general public. The Bombay Municipal
Corporation Act was admittedly an existing law at the ,date of the commencement of the
Constitution but ss. 354R to 354RA were substituted for the earlier provisos by S. 18 of Bombay Act
34 of 1954. So what we have to ascertain is whether the law -as it stands imposes a reasonable
restriction on the tenant's right to hold the demised premises. For this purpose we win have to
,examine the provisions of the Act which empower the Corporation to make a clearance order.

Sub-section (1) of S. 354R provides that if it shall appear to the Commissioner, among other things,
(a) that residential buildings in any area are by reason of disrepair unfit for human habitation or for
like reason dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the area and

(b) that the conditions in the area can be effectually remedied by the demolition of all the buildings
in the area without making an improvement scheme, the Commissioner can define the area and
submit a draft clearance scheme for the approval of the Corporation. The Corporation can then pass
a resolution declaring that the area as defined and approved by it to be clearance area. Sub-section
(2) provides, among other things, that the Corporation should ascertain the number of persons who

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 10Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

are likely to be dishoused in such area and thereafter take such measures as are practicable to
ensure that as little hard
ship as possible is inflicted on those dishoused. The resolution is. then required to be forwarded to
the State Government.

Sub-section (4) provides as follows :

"As soon as may be after the Corporation have declared any area to be a clearance area, the
Commissioner shall, in accordance with the appropriate provisions hereafter contained in this Act,
proceed to secure the clearance of the area in one or other of the following ways, or partly in one of
those ways, and partly in the other of them, that is to say
(a) by ordering the demolition of the buildings in the area; or

(b) by acquiring on behalf of the Corporation land comprised in the area and
undertaking or otherwise securing, the demolition of the buildings thereon."

Sub-section (1) of s. 354RA requires the Corporation to submit the clearance order to the State
Government for confirmation. Sub-section (4) reads thus : "Before submitting the order to the State
Government, the Commissioner shall
(a) publish simultaneously in the Official Gazette and in three or more newspapers circulating
within Greater Bombay, a notice stating the fact of such a clearance order having been made and
describing the area comprised therein and naming a place where a copy of the order and of the plan
referred to therein may be seen at all reasonable hours; and

(b) serve on every person whose name appears in the Commissioner's assessment book as primarily
liable for payment of property tax leviable under this Act, on any building included in the area to
which the clearance order relates and, so far as it is reasonably practicable to ascertain such persons,
on every mortgagee thereof, a notice stating the effect of the clearance order and that it is about to
be submitted to the State Government for confirmation, and specifying the time within and the
manner in which objections thereto can be made to the Commissioner."

Under sub-s. (5) objections, if any, received by the Commissioner are to be submitted to the
Improvements Committee and that Committee is entitled under sub-s. (6) to make such
modifications .in respect of the order as it may think fit. The matter is then to go to the Corporation
and thereafter to the State Government. Sub-section (7) provides that the provisions of Schedule GG
to the Act shall have effect with respect to the validity and date of operation of a clearance order. We
are not concerned with the rest of the provisions of S. 354RA. Clause (1) of Schedule GG provides
that as soon as the clearance order is confirmed by the State Government the Commissioner has to
publish, in the same manner as a notice under sub-s. (4) of S. 354RA, a notice stating that the order
has been confirmed. Clause (2) is important and we would reproduce it. It runs thus :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 11Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

"Any person aggrieved by such an order as aforesaid, or by the State Government's
approval of a redevelopment plan or of a new plan may, within six weeks after the
publication of notice of confirmation of the order, or of the approval of the plan,
prefer an appeal to a Judge of the City Civil Court, Bombay, whose decision shall be
final."

It is contended on behalf of the Corporation by Mr. Setalvad and also on behalf of the landlords by
the Solicitor-General that a tenant is entitled to raise an objection to the making of a clearance order
not only under cl. (b) of sub-s. (4) of S. 354RA but also in his appeal under cl. (2) of Schedule GG. It
is no doubt true that there is no express mention of tenants in either of these provisions but from
the fact that cl. (a) of sub-s. (4) of s. 354RA requires the publication of the clearance order it would
be reasonable to infer that the object of doing so is to invite objections at the instance of persons
who would be affected by the order. Since tenants would be affected by it, they fall in this class. It is
true that cl. (b) of that provision contemplates actual service of notice only on the persons primarily
liable to pay property tax and on the mortgagees of the property but not on others and also says that
the time within and the manner in which objections to the order could be made to the
Commissioner should also be specified but it does not say anything regarding the tenants. But if
because of this we were to hold that it would not be open to a tenant or any other person who would
be affected by the order, to lodge an objection to the proposed order it would be making the
publication of notice practically meaningless. Undoubtedly tenants are persons who would be
affected by the Order. Sub-section (2) of S. 354R casts certain duties upon the Corporation with
respect to the persons who are likely to be dishoused in consequence of the clearance order. It
would, therefore, be legitimate to infer that a corresponding right was conferred upon the tenants to
secure the performance of its duties towards them by the Corporation. This right would be in
addition to their interest in the property itself. They must, therefore, be held to be persons who are
entitled to lodge an objection to the proposed order. Mr. Shroff, however, contends that cl. (b) of
sub-s. (4) of s. 354RA confines the right to lodge an objection only to the persons specified in that
clause and that there is nothing in the language of cl.

(a) from which a similar right can be deduced in favour of other persons. It seems to us that in order
to give full effect to the provisions of both cls. (a) and (b) of sub-s. (4) the words "and specifying the
time within and manner in which objections thereto can be made to the Commissioner" occurring at
the end of cl. (b) should be read as governing not only the rest of cl. (b) but also cl. (a). We would
not-be re-writing the section if we did so because if the object of the legislature was to give a right to
lodge objections only to the persons specified in cl. (4) (b), sub-s. (5) would not have said that the
Commissioner shall submit to the Improvements Committee the objections received under sub-s.
(4), but would have said instead "objections received under cl. (b) of sub-s. (4) That a right has been
conferred upon a tenant to lodge an objection is made further clear by the provisions of cl. (2) of
Schedule GG which we have earlier reproduced. The expression " any person aggrieved" is
sufficiently wide to include not only a tenant but also an occupant of a building who is likely to be
dishoused as a result of the action taken under a clearance order. The expression "person aggrieved"
has not been defined in the Act and, therefore, we are entitled to give it its natural meaning. The
natural meaning would certainly include a person whose interest is in any manner affected by the
order. We are supported in this by the observations of James L. J., pointed out in Ex parte

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/358754/ 42Muncipal Corporation For Greater ... vs Lala Pancham Of Bombay & Others on 1 October, 1964

Sidebotham, In re Sidebotham.(1) A similar expression occurring in s. 24(1) of the Administration
of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 was the subject of construction in Sharifuddin v. R. P. Singh.(1) The
learned Judges there held that these words are of the widest amplitude and are wide enough to
include an. Assistant Custodian of Evacuee Properties.

(1) 880) 14 Ch.D. 458 at p. 465.
(2) (1956) I.L.R. 35 Pat. 920.

Since the right conferred by cl. (2) of Schedule GG upon an aggrieved person is a right to prefer an
appeal against a clearance order, as confirmed by the Government, before a Judge of the City Civil
Court, Mr. Shroff contends that the words " aggrieved person" therein must necessarily mean a
person who was a party to the order. It is true that ordinarily a right of appeal is conferred on a
person who is a party to the proceeding but that would be so only where the proceeding is between
certain parties. A proceeding of the nature contemplated by S. 354R is not, strictly speaking, a
proceeding between the parties ranged on opposite sides. What is contemplated is the exercise of
certain powers by the Corporation which will affect the interests of a variety of persons or a class or
classes of persons. and cl. (2) of schedule GG gives a right to any of them to prefer an appeal if his
legal right or interest is affected by any action of the Corporation taken in pursuance of its powers.

Upon a reasonable construction of S. 354RA and Schedule GG it must, therefore, be held that they
afford opportunities to tenants to object to the clearance order. It follows from this that the
restrictions on the tenants' right to hold property enacted by ss. 354R and 354RA are not
unreasonable and that the provisions are valid. Mr. Shroff agrees that if the restrictions are
reasonable his contention that these provisions are unconstitutional must fail.

Upon the view then that these provisions are valid it must further follow that it was open to the
plaintiffs to prefer an appeal before a Judge of the Civil Court. Finality is given to a clearance order
after its confirmation by the Government and its publication in the manner prescribed in cl. (2) of
Schedule GG subject only to the result of an appeal preferred under cl. (2) of Schedule GG by a
person aggrieved. If no such appeal is preferred or if such, appeal is filed and dismissed no remedy
by suit is available to a person like a tenant who contends that he is aggrieved. Agreeing with the
learned City Civil Court Judge we hold that the plaintiffs' suit was not maintainable. Accordingly we
set aside the judgment of the High Court and allow this appeal. We, however, make no order as to
costs. Appeal allowed.

HEADNOTE:

The appellant is a limited company which is primarily
engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of sugar and
it has a cold storage plant and a steel foundry. With
reference to a news item dated 10th October 1968 in the
National Herald in which it was stated that the State of
Uttar Pradesh had decided to give exemption from sales tax
for a period of three years under section 4A of the U.P.
Sales Tax Act to all new industrial units in the State with
a view to enabling them "to come on firm footing in
developing stage", the appellant addressed a letter dated
11th October 1968 to the Director of Industries stating that
in view of the sales tax holiday announced by the Government
the appellant intended to set up a Hydrogenation plant for
manufacture of Vanaspati and sought for confirmation that
this industrial unit which it proposed to set up, would be
entitled to sales tax holiday' for a period of three years
from the date it commenced production. The Director of
Industries by his letter dated 14th October 1968, confirmed
that "there will be no sales tax for three years on the
finished product of your proposed Vanaspati factory from the
date it gets power connection for commencing production".
Thereafter when the appellant's representative met the 4th
respondent, who was at that time the Chief Secretary to the
Government as also Advisor to the Governor and apprised the
latter that the appellant was setting up the Vanaspati
factory solely on the basis of the assurance given on behalf
of the Government that the appellant would be entitled to
exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from
the date of commencement of commercial production at the
factory, the 4th respondent reiterated the assurance made.
Again the appellant, by its letter dated 13th December 1968,
requested the 4th respondent "to please confirm that we
shall be allowed sales tax holiday for a _ period of three
years on the sale of Vanaspati from the date we start
production". The 4th respondent replied on 22nd December
1968 that “the State Government will be willing to consider
your request for grant of exemption from U.P. Sales Tax for
a period of three years from the date of
642
production" and asked the appellant to obtain the requisite
application form and submit a formal application to the
Secretary to the Government in the Industries department,
and in the meanwhile "to go ahead with the arrangements for
setting up the factory". The appellant in the meantime had
submitted an application dated 21st December 1968 for a
formal order granting exemption from sales tax under section

be given only partial concession in Sales Tax at
tes on each year of production. The appellant,
er dated 25th June 1970, pointed out to the
the Government that the appellant proposed to
cial production of Vanaspati with effect from
70 and stated that, as notified in the letter of
1970, the appellant would be availing of the

ellant informed the Secretary to the Government
ame by its letter dated 3rd July 1970. The State
however, once again changed its decision and on
1970, a news item appeared in the ‘Northern
ka' stating that the Government had decided to
earlier decision i.e. the decision set out in
dated 20th January 1970, to allow concession in
Sales Tax to new Vanaspati Units. The appellant
led a writ petition in the High Court of
king for a writ directing the State Government
the sales of Vanaspati manufactured by the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

appellant from Sales Tax for a period of three years
commencing from 2nd January 1970 by issuing a notification
under section 4A of the U.P. Sales Tax Act from the
appellant for the said period of three years. The plea based
on the
643
doctrine of promissory estoppel was, however rejected by the
Division Bench of the High Court principally on the ground
that the appellant had waived the exemption, if any, by
accepting the concessional rates set out in the letter of
the respondent dated 20th January 1970.

Allowing the appeal by certificate, the Court,

HELD: 1. The view taken by the High Court, namely, that
even if there was an assurance given by the 4th respondent
on behalf of the State Government and such assurance was
binding on the State Government on the principle of
promissory estoppel, the appellant had waived its right
under it by a accepting the concessional rates of sales tax
set out in the letter of the 5th respondent dated 20th
January, 1970 is not correct. [656 D-E]

2. Waiver is a question of fact and it must be properly
pleaded and proved. No plea of waiver can be allowed to be
raised unless it is pleaded and the factual foundation for
it is laid in the pleadings. [656 E-F]

In the instant case:

(a) the plea of waiver was not taken by the State
Government in the affidavit filed on its behalf in reply to
the writ petition, nor was it indicated even vaguely in such
affidavit. It was raised for the first time at the hearing
of the writ petition. That was clearly impermissible without
an amendment of the affidavit in reply or a supplementary
affidavit raising such plea. [656 F]

(b) It was not right for the High Court to have allowed
the plea of waiver to be raised against the appellant and
that plea should have been rejected in limine. If waiver
were properly pleaded in the affidavit in reply, the
appellant would have had an opportunity of placing on record
facts showing why and in what circumstances the appellant
came to address the letter dated 25th June 1970 and
establishing that on those facts there was no waiver by the
appellant of its right to exemption under the assurance
given by the 4th respondent. But in the absence of such
pleading in the affidavit in reply, this opportunity was
denied to the appellant [656F-H]

3. Waiver means abandonment of a right and it may be
either express or implied from conduct, but its basic
requirement is that it must be "an intentional act with
knowledge". There can be no waiver unless the person who is
said to have waived is fully informed as to his right and
with full knowledge of such right, he intentionally abandons
it. [657A, B]

In the instant case, on the facts, the plea of waiver

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

could not be said to have been made out by the State

Government:

There was nothing to state that at the date when

the appellant addressed the letter dated 25th June 1970, it
had full knowledge of its right to exemption under the

assurance

given by the 4th respondent and that it

intentionally abandoned such right. It is not possible to

presume in
Court, that

exemption so

waived such

the absence of any material placed before the
the appellant had full knowledge of its right to
as to warrant an inference that the appellant
right by addressing the letter dated 25th June

1970. It is difficult to speculate what was the reason why
the appellant addressed the letter 25th June 1970 stating
that it would avail of the concessional rates of sales tax
granted under the letter dated 20th January 1970. [657 D-E]

4. The doctrine called ‘promissory  estoppel',
‘equitable estoppel', ‘quasi estoppel', and ‘new estoppel’

is a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice where a

promise is

on and it is

made by a person knowing that it would be acted
person to whom it is made and in fact it is so

acted on and it is inequitable to allow the party making the
promise to go back upon it. Though commonly named promissory

estoppel it

is neither in the realm of contract nor in the

realm of estoppel. The basis of the doctrine is the inter

position of

equity, which has always true to its form

stepped in to mitigate the rigours of strict law. [658 E-G]

5. The
where one

true principle of promissory estoppel is that

party has by his words or conduct made to the

other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to

create legal

relationship effect a legal relationship to

arise in the future, knowing or intending that it would be

acted upon

by the other party to whom the promise is made

and it is infact so acted upon by the other party, the
promise would be binding on the party making it and he would
not be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be

inequitable

to allow him to do so having regard to the

dealings which have taken place between the parties, and

this would

be so irrespective whether there is any pre
existing relationship between the parties or not. Equity

applicability of the doctrine of promissory
is not necessary that there should be some
relationship between the parties. Nor can any

such limitation, namely, that the doctrine of promissory

estoppel is

limited in its operation to cases where the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

parties are already contractually bound and one of the
parties induces the other to believe that the strict rights
under the contract would not be enforced be justifiably
introduced to curtail the width and amplitude of the
doctrine. The parties need not be in any kind of legal
relationship before the transaction from which’ the
promissory estoppel take its origin. The doctrine would
apply even where there is no pre-existing legal relationship
between the parties, but the promise is intended to create
legal relations or affect a legal relationship whish will
arise in future. [660 G-H, 661 A, F-G].

6. The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be
inhibited by the same limitation estoppel in the
strict sense of the term. It is an equitable principle
evolved by the Courts for doing justice and there is no
reason why it should be given only a limited application by
way of defence and it should only be a shield and not a
sword to found a cause of action. It can be the basis of a
cause of action. [662 D-E, 663 E-F].

There is no qualitative difference between ‘proprietary
estoppel' and ‘promissory estoppel'. Both are the off
springs of equity and if equity is flexible enough to permit
proprietary estoppel to be used as a cause of action, there
is no reason in logic or principle why promissory estoppel
should also not be available as cause of action, if
necessary to satisfy the equity. [665 G-H]

7. Law is not a mausoleum. It is not an antique to be
taken down, dusted admired and put back on the shelf. It is
rather like an old but vigorous tree having its roots in
history, yet continuously taking new grafts and putting out

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

new sprouts and occasionally dropping dead wood. It is
essentially a social process, the end product of which is
justice and hence it must keep on growing and developing
with changing social concepts and values. Otherwise, there
will be estrangement between law and justice and law will
cease to have legitimacy Though ‘continuity with the past is
a historical necessity', ‘conformity is not to be’ turned
into a fetish'. [668 H, 669 A-B].

Therefore, despite the fact that allowing promissory
estoppel to found a cause of action would seriously dilute
the principle which requires consideration to support a
contractual obligation, this new principle, which is a child
of equity brought into the world with a view to promoting
honesty and good faith and bringing, law closer to justice
should not be held in fetters but allowed to operate in all
its activist magnitude. so that it may fulfil the purpose
for which was conceived and born. [668 F-G].

8. A promise may, in the United States, derive
contractual enforceability if it has been made by the
promisor knowing or intending that it would be acted on and
the promisee has altered his position in reliance on it,
notwithstanding that there is no consideration in the sense
in which that word is used in English
646
and Commonwealth jurisprudence. However, the basic
requirement for invoking this principle must be present
namely that the fact situation should be such that injustice
can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The
doctrine of promissory estoppel has been used in the United
States to reduce, if not to destroy, the prestige of
consideration as an essential of valid contract and also
used in diverse other situations as founding a cause of
action: [670 D-E, 673 B].

Under the English law, the judicially formed view is
that the crown is not immune from liability under the
doctrine of promissory estoppel and the view taken by
Denning J., in [1949] 1K. B. 227 that the crown cannot
escape its obligation under the doctrine of promissory
estoppel by “praying in aid the doctrine of executive
necessity" still holds the field. [674 D].

10. Even in the United States, the trend in the State
Courts, of late, has been strongly in favour of the
application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel against
the Government and public bodies “where interests of
justice, morality and common fairness clearly dictate that
course". It is being increasingly felt that "the Government
ought to set a high standard in its dealings and
relationships with citizens and the word of a duly
authorised Government agent, acting within the scope of his
authority, ought to be as good as a Government bond". The
Government would not be estopped "by the acts of its
officers and agents who without authority enter into
agreements to do what the law does not sanction or permit"
and "these dealing with an agent of the Government must be
held to have notice of limitations of his authority". But if
the acts of omissions of officers of the Government are
within the scope of their authority and are not otherwise
impermissible under the law, they "will work estoppel
against Government". [676 F-H, 677 A-D]

11. Where the Government makes a promise knowing or
intending that it would be acted on by the promisee and, in
fact, the promisee, acting in reliance on it, alters his
position, the Government would be held bound by the promise
and the promise would be enforceable against the Government
at the instance of the promisee notwithstanding that there
is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not
recorded in the form of a_ formal contract as required by
Article 299 of the Constitution. [682 G-H, 683-A].

647

It is elementary that in a Republic governed by the
rule of law, no one, a however high or low is above the law.
Every one is subject to the law as fully and completely as
any other and the Government is no exception. It is indeed
the pride of constitutional democracy and rule of law that
the Government stands on the same footing as a _ private
individual so far as the obligation of the law is concerned;
the former is equally bound as the latter. On no principle
can a Government committed to the rule of law, claim
immunity from the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The
Government cannot be heard to say tha it is under no
obligation to act in a manner that is fair and just or that
it is not bound by considerations of ‘honesty and good
faith'. In fact the Government should be held to a high
"standard of rectangular rectitude while dealing with its
citizens". [683 A-C].

12. The doctrine of executive necessity, regarded as
sufficient Justification for the Government to repudiate
even its contractual obligations was emphatically negatived
in the Indo-Afghan Agencies case and the supremacy of the
laws was established, [683 C-D]

Therefore, it is not open to Government to claim
immunity from the applicability of the rule of promissory
estopped and thereby repudiate a promise made by it on the
ground that such promise may fetter its future executive
action. If the Government wants to preserve its freedom of
executive action from being hampered or restricted, the
Government should not make a promise knowing or intending
that it would be acted on by the promisee and the promisee
would alter his position relying upon it. But, if the
Government makes such a promise and the promisee acts in
reliance upon it and alters his position the Government
would be compelled to make good such promise like any other
private individual. [683 D-F]

13. The law cannot acquire legitimacy and gain social
acceptance unless it accords with the moral values of the
society. It should be the constant endeavor of the Courts
and the legislatures to close the gap between law and
morality and bring about as near an approximation between
the two as possible. The doctrine of promissory estopped is
a significant judicial contribution in that direction. [683
F-G].

Since the doctrine of promissory estoppel is an
equitable doctrine, it must yield when the equity so
requires. If it could be shown the by Government that having
regard to the facts as they have transpired, it would be
inequitable to hold the Government to the promise made by
it, the Court would not raise an equity in favour of the
promisee and enforce the promise against the Government.

648

The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in
such a case because on the facts, equity would not require
that the Government should be held bound by the promise made
by it. [683 G-H, 684 A]

When the Government is able to show that in view of the
facts, as they have transpired public interest would be
prejudiced if the Government were required to carry out the
promise, the Court would have to balance, the public
interest in the Government carrying out a promise made to a
citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and
alter his position and the public interest likely to suffer
if the promise were required to be carried out by the
Government and determine which way the equity lies. It would

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

not be enough for the Government just to say that public
interest requires that the Government should not be
compelled to carry out the promise or that the public
interest would suffer if the Government were required to
honour it. The Government cannot claim to be exempt from the
liability to carry out the promise ‘on some indefinite and
undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency', nor can the
Government claim to be the sole judge of its liability and
repudiate it ‘on an exparte appraisement of the
circumstances. [684 A-D]

In order to resist its liability, the Government should
disclose to the Court the various events necessitating its
claim to be exempt from the liability and it would be for
the Court to decide whether those events are such as_ to
render it inequitable to enforce the liability against the
Government. [684 D-E]

Mere claim of change of policy would not be sufficient
to exonerate the Government from the liability: the
Government would have to’ show precisely the changed policy
with the reason and justification therefor, to enable the
Court to judge for “itself which way the public interest
lies and what equity of the case demands. It is only if the
Court is satisfied, on proper and adequate material placed
by the Government, that over-riding public interest requires
that the Government should not be held bound by the promise
but should be free to act unfettered by it that the Court
would refuse to enforce the promise against the Government.
[684 E-F]

The essence of the rule of law is that the Court would
not act on the mere ipse dixit of the Government, for it is
the Court which has to decide and not the Government,
whether the Government should be held exempt from
liability. [684 F-G]

The burden would be upon the Government to show that
the public interest in the Government acting otherwise than
in accordance with the promise is so overwhelming that it
would be inequitable to hold the Government bound by the
promise and the Court would insist ona highly rigorous
standard of proof in the discharge of this burden. But even
where there is no such over-riding public interest, it may
still be competent to the Government to resile from the
promise 'on giving reasonable notice, which need not be a
formal notice, giving the promisee a reasonable opportunity
of resuming his position' provided of course it is possible
for the promisee to restore status quo ante. If, however,
the promisee cannot resume his position, the promise would
become final and irrevocable. [684 G-H, 685 A].

14. So far as the doctrine of promissory estoppel is
concerned, no distinction can be made between a_ private
individual and a public body. This doctrine is also

applicable against a public body like a municipal council.
However, this doctrine cannot be applied in teeth of an
obligation or liability imposed by law. It cannot be invoked
to compel the Government or even a private party to do an
act prohibited by law. There can also be no promissory
estoppel against the exercise of legislative power. The
Legislature can never be precluded from exercising its
legislative function by resort to the doctrine of promissory estoppel. [688C, G-H 689 A].

15. In order to attract the applicability of the
doctrine of promissory estoppel, it is not necessary that
the promisee, acting in reliance on the promise, should
suffer any deteriment. What is necessary is no more than
that there should be alteration of his position in reliance
on the promise. If detriment were a necessary element, there
would be no need for the doctrine of promissory estoppel
because, in that event in quite a few cases, the detriment
would form the consideration and the promise would be
binding, as a contract. If by deteriment is meant injustice
to the promisee which would result if the promisor were to
resile from his promisee, then detriment would certainly
come in as a necessary ingredient. The detriment in such a
case is not some prejudice sneered by the promisee acting on
the promise, put the prejudice which would be caused to the
promisee, if the promisor were allowed to back on the
promise. It is not necessary for the promisee to show that
he has acted to his detriment. All that he has to show is
that he has acted to reliance on the promise and altered his
position. [694 A-B, F-G, 695 E, 694 D].

In the instant case.

The facts necessary for involving the doctrine of
promissory estoppel were clearly resent and the Government
was bound to carry out the representation and exempt the
appellant from sales tax in respect of sales of Vanaspati
effected by it in Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years
from the date of commencement of the production. [693 F-G]

(a) The letter dated 23rd January 1969 was a
representation on behalf of the Government, the
representation having been made by the 4th respondent in his
capacity as the Chief Secretary of the Government
categorically to the effect that the appellant would be
entitled to exemption from sales tax in respect of the sale
of vanaspati effected in Uttar Pradesh for a period of three
years from the date of commencement of production. This
representation was made by way of clarification in view of
the suggestion in the appellant letter dated 2 nd January
1969 that the financial institutions were not prep ed to
regard the earlier letter of the 4th respondent dated 22nd
December 1968 as a definite commitment on the part of the
Government to grant exemption from sales tax. [692 H, 693 AB]

(b) The representation made by the 4th respondent was a
representation within the scope of his authority and was
binding on the Government in as much as the 4th respondent,
who was at the material time the Chief Secretary to the
Government and also Adviser to the Governor discharging the
functions of the Government during the President's Rule had
authority to bind the Governor. Moreover the averment to
this effect in the Writ Petition was not denied by the State
in the affidavit in reply filed on its behalf [693 C-D].

(c) This representation was made by the Government
knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the
appellant because the appellant made it clear that it was
only on account of the exemption from sales tax promised by
the Government that the appellant had decided to set up the
factory for manufacture of Vanaspati. In fact the appellant
relying on this representation of the Government, borrowed
moneys from various financial institutions, purchased plant
and machinery from M/s. De Smith (India) Pvt. Ltd., Bombay
and set up a Vanaspati factory at Kanpur. [693 E-F]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J., This appeal by certificate raises a
question of considerable importance in the field of public law. How far and to what extent is the
State bound by the doctrine of promissory estoppel ? It is a doctrine of comparatively recent origin
but it is potentially so fruitful and pregnant with such vast possibilities for growth that traditional
lawyers are alarmed lest it might upset existing doctrines which are looked upon almost
reverentially and which have held the field for a long number of years. The law in regard to
promissory estoppel is not yet well settled though it has been the subject of considerable debate in
England as well as the United States of America and it has also received consideration in some
recent decisions in India and we, therefore, propose to discuss it in some detail with a view to
defining its contours and demarcating its parameters. We will first state briefly the facts giving rise
to this appeal. This is necessary because it is only where certain fact-situations exist that promissory
estoppel can be invoked and applied.

The appellant is a limited company which is primarily engaged in the business of manufacture and
sale of sugar and it has also a cold storage plant and a steel foundry. On 10th October, 1968 a news
item appeared in the National Herald in which it was stated that the State of Uttar Pradesh had
decided to give exemption from sales tax for a period of three years under section 4A of the U.P.
Sales Tax Act to all new industrial units in the State with a view to enabling them "to come on firm
footing in developing stage". This news item was based upon a statement made by Shri M. P.
Chatterjee the then Secretary in the Industries Department of the Government. The appellant, on
the basis of this announcement, addressed a letter dated 11th October, 1968 to the Director of
Industries stating that in view of the sales tax holiday announced by the Government, the appellant
intended to set up a Hydro-genation Plant for manufacture of Vanaspati and sought for
confirmation that this industrial unit, which it proposed to set up would be entitled to sales tax
holiday for a period of three years from the date it commenced production. The Director of
Industries replied by his letter dated 14th October, 1968 confirming that "there will be no sales tax
for three years on the finished product of your proposed Vanaspati factory from the date it gets
power connection for commencing production." The appellant thereupon started taking steps to
contact various financiers for financing the project and also initiated negotiations with

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 13M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

manufacturers for purchase of machinery for setting up the Vanaspati factory. On 12th December,
1968 the appellant's representative met the 4th respondent who was at that time the Chief Secretary
to the Government as also Advisor to the Governor and intimated to him that the appellant was
setting up the Vanaspati factory solely on the basis of the assurance given on behalf of the
Government that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three
years from the date of commencement of commercial production at the factory and the 4th
respondent reiterated the assurance that the appellant would be entitled to sales tax holiday in case
the Vanaspati factory was put up by it. The appellant by its letter dated 13th December, 1968 placed
on record what had transpired at the meeting on the previous day and requested the 4th respondent
"to please confirm that we shall be allowed sales tax holiday for a period of three years on the sale of
Vanaspati from the date we start production." On the same day the appellant entered into an
agreement with M/s. De Smith (India) Pvt. Ltd., Bombay for supply of plant and machinery for the
Vanaspati factory, providing clearly that the appellant would have the option to terminate the
agreement, if within 10 weeks exemption from sales tax was not granted by the State Government.
The 4th respondent replied on 22nd December, 1968 confirming that "the State Government will be
willing to consider your request for grant of exemption from U.P. Sales Tax for a period of three
years from the date of production" and asked the appellant to obtain the requisite application form
and submit a formal application to the Secretary to the Government in the Industries Department
and in the meanwhile to "go ahead with the arrangements for setting up the factory". The appellant
had in the meantime submitted an application dated 21st December, 1968 for a formal order
granting exemption from sales tax under section 4A of the Act. It appears that the letter of the 4th
respondent dated 22nd December, 1968 was not regarded as sufficient by the financial institutions
which were approached by the appellant for financing the project since it merely stated that the
State Government would be willing to consider the request for grant of exemption and did not
convey any decision of the State Government that the exemption would be granted. The appellant,
therefore, addressed a letter dated 22nd January, 1969 to the 4th respondent pointing out that the
financial institutions were of the view that the letter of the 4th respondent dated 22nd December,
1968 "did not purport to commit the Government for the concession mentioned" and it was,
therefore, necessary to obtain a formal order of exemption in terms of the application submitted by
it. The 4th respondent, however, stated categorically in his letter in reply dated 23rd January, 1969
that the proposed Vanaspati Factory of the appellant "will be entitled to exemption from U.P. Sales
Tax for a period of three years from the date of going into production and that this will apply to all
Vanaspati sold during that period in Uttar Pradesh itself" and expressed his surprise that "a letter
from the Chief Secretary to the State Government stating this fact in clear and unambiguous words
should not carry conviction with the financial institutions." In view of this unequivocal assurance
given by the 4th respondent, who not only occupied the post of Chief Secretary to the Government
but was also Advisor to the Governor functioning under the President's rule, the appellant went
ahead with the setting up of the Vanaspati Factory. The appellant by its letter dated 25th April, 1969
advised the 4th respondent that the U.P. Finance Corporation, being convinced by the clear and
categorical assurance given by the 4th respondent that the Vanaspati Factory of the appellant would
be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement
of production, had sanctioned financial assistance to the appellant and the appellant was going
ahead with the project in full speed to enable it to start production at the earliest. The appellant
made considerable progress in the setting up of the Vanaspati Factory but it seems that by the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 14M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

middle of May 1969 the State Government started having second thoughts on the question of
exemption and a letter dated 16 May, 1969 was addressed by the 5th respondent who was Deputy
Secretary to the Government in the Industries Department, intimating that a meeting has been
called by the Chief Minister on 23rd May, 1969 "to discuss the question of giving concession in Sales
Tax on Vanaspati products" and requesting the appellant to attend the meeting. The appellant
immediately by its letter dated 19th May, 1969 pointed out to the 5th respondent that so far as the
appellant was concerned, the State Government had already granted exemption from Sales Tax by
the letter of the Chief Secretary dated 23rd January, 1969 but still, the appellant would be glad to
send its representative to attend the meeting as desired by the 5th respondent. The proposed
meeting was, however, postponed and the appellant was intimated by the 5th respondent by its
letter dated 23rd May, 1969 that the meeting would now be held on 3rd June, 1969. The appellant's
representative attended the meeting on that day and reiterated that so far as the appellant was
concerned, it had already been granted exemption from Sales Tax and the State Government stood
committed to it. The appellant thereafter proceeded with the work of setting up the Vanaspati plant
on the basis that in accordance with the assurance given by the 4th respondent on behalf of the State
Government, the appellant would be exempt from payment of Sales Tax for a period of three years
from the date of commencement of production.

The State Government however went back upon this assurance and a letter dated 20th January,
1970 was addressed by the 5th respondent intimating that the Government had taken a policy
decision that new Vanaspati Units in the State which go into commercial production by 30th
September, 1970 would be given partial concession in Sales Tax at the following rates for a period of
three years:

First year of production 31/2% Second year of production 3% Third year of
production 21/2% The appellant by its letter dated 25th June, 1970 pointed out to the
Secretary to the Government that the appellant proposed to start commercial
production of Vanaspati with effect from ist July, 1970, and stated that, as notified in
the letter dated 20th January, 1970, the appellant would be availing of the exemption
granted by the State Government and would be charging sales tax at the rate of
31/2% instead of 7% on the sales of Vanaspati manufactured by it for a period of one
year commencing from ist July, 1970. The factory of the appellant thereafter went
into production from 2nd July, 1970 and the appellant informed the Secretary to the
Government about the same by its letter dated 3rd July, 1970. The State Government
however once again changed its decision and on 12th August, 1970 a news item
appeared in the Northern India Patricia stating that the Government had decided to
rescind the earlier decision i.e. the decision set out in the letter dated 20th January,
1970, to allow concession in the rates of Sales Tax to new Vanaspati Units. The
appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in the High Court of Allahabad asking for a
writ directing the State Government to exempt the sales of Vanaspati manufactured
by the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years commencing from 2nd July,
1970 by issuing a notification under section 4A and not to collect or charge sales tax
from the appellant for the said period of three years. It appears that in the writ
petition as originally filed, there was no plea of promissory estoppel taken against the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 15M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

State Government and the writ petition was, therefore, amended by obtaining leave
of the High Court with a view to introducing the plea of promissory estoppel. The
appellant urged in the amended writ petition that the 4th respondent acting on behalf
of the State Government had given an unequivocal assurance to the appellant that the
appellant would be entitled to exemption from payment of sales tax for a period of
three years from the date of commencement of the production and this assurance was
given by the 4th respondent intending or knowing that it would be acted on by the
appellant and in fact the appellant, acting in reliance on it, established the Vanaspati
factory by investing a large amount and the State Government was, therefore, bound
to honour the assurance and exempt the Vanaspati manufactured and sold by the
appellant from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from 2nd July, 1970.
This plea based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel was, however rejected by the
Division Bench of the High Court principally on the ground that the appellant had
waived the exemption, if any, by accepting the concessional rates set out in the letter
of the Deputy Secretary dated 20th January, 1970. The appellant thereupon preferred
the present appeal after obtaining a certificate of fitness from the High Court.

The principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the
4th respondent had given a categorical assurance on behalf of the State Government that the
appellant would be exempt from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from the date of
commencement of production and such assurance was given intending or knowing that it would be
acted on by the appellant and in fact the appellant, acting in reliance on it, altered its position and
the State Government was, therefore, bound, on the principle of promissory estoppel, to honour the
assurance and exempt the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years from 2nd July, 1970,
being the date on which the factory of the appellant commenced production. The appellant assailed
the view taken by the High Court that this claim of the appellant for exemption based on the
doctrine of promissory estoppel was barred by waiver, because the appellant had by its letter dated
25th June, 1970 accepted that it would avail of the exemption granted under the letter of the 5th
respondent dated 20th January, 1970 and charged sales tax at the concessional rate of 31/2%
instead of 7% during the first year of its production. The appellant urged that waiver was a question
of fact which was required to be pleaded and since no plea of waiver was raised in the affidavit filed
on behalf of the State Government in opposition to the writ petition, it was not competent to the
State Government to rely on the plea of waiver for the first time at the hearing of the writ petition.
Even if the plea of waiver were allowed to be raised, notwithstanding that it did not find place in the
pleadings, no waiver was made out, said the appellant, since there was nothing to show that were
the circumstances in which the appellant had addressed the letter dated 25th June, 1970 stating that
it would avail of the exemption granted under the letter dated 20th January, 1970 and it was not
possible to say that the appellant, with full knowledge of its right to claim total exemption from
payment of sales tax, waived that right and agreed to accept the concessional rates set out in the
letter dated 20th January, 1970. The State Government on the other hand strongly pressed the plea
of waiver and submitted that the appellant had clearly waived its right to complete exemption from
payment of Sales Tax by addressing the letter dated 25th June, 1970. The State Government also
contended that, in any event, even if there was no waiver, the appellant was not entitled to enforce
the assurance given by the 4th respondent, since such assurance was not binding on the State

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 16M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

Government and more-over, in the absence of notification under section 4A, the State Government
could not be prevented from enforcing the liability to sales tax imposed on the appellant under the
provisions of the Act. It was urged on behalf of the State Government that there could be no
promissory estoppel against the State Government so as to inhibit it from formulating and
implementing its policies in public interest. These were broadly the rival contentions urged on
behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to consider them.

We shall first deal with the question of waiver since that can be disposed of in a few words. The High
Court held that even if there was an assurance given by the 4th respondent on behalf of the State
Government and such assurance was binding on the State Government on the principle of
promissory estoppel, the appellant had waived its right under it by accepting the concessional rates
of sales tax set out in the letter of the 5th respondent dated 20th January, 1970. We do not think this
view taken by the High Court can be sustained. In the first place, it is elementary that waiver is a
question of fact and it must be properly pleaded and proved. No plea of waiver can be allowed to be
raised unless it is pleaded and the factual foundation for it is laid in the pleadings. Here it was
common ground that the plea of waiver was not taken by the State Government in the affidavit filed
on its behalf in reply to the writ petition, nor was it indicated even vaguely in such affidavit. It was
raised for the first time at the hearing of the writ petition. That was clearly impermissible without an
amendment of the affidavit in reply or a supplementary affidavit raising such plea. If waiver were
properly pleaded in the affidavit in reply, the appellant would have had an opportunity of placing on
record facts showing why and in what circumstances the appellant came to address the letter dated
25th June, 1970 and establishing that on these facts there was no waiver by the appellant of its right
to exemption under the assurance given by the 4th respondent. But in the absence of such pleading
in the affidavit in reply, this opportunity was denied to the appellant. It was, therefore, not right for
the High Court to have allowed the plea of waiver to be raised against the appellant and that plea
should have been rejected in limine.

Secondly, it is difficult to see how, on the facts, the plea of waiver could be said to have been made
out by the State Government. Waiver means abandonment of a right and it may be either express or
implied from conduct, but its basic requirement is that it must be "an intentional act with
knowledge". Per Lord Chelmsford, L.C. in Earl of Darnley v. London, Chatham and Dover Rly. Co.
There can be no waiver unless the person who is said to have waived is fully informed as to his right
and with full knowledge of such right, he intentionally abandons it. It is pointed out in Halsbury's
Laws of England (4 d) Volume 16 in paragraph 1472 at page 994 that for a "waiver to be effectual it
is essential that the person granting it should be fully informed as to his rights" and Isaacs, J,
delivering the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Craine v. Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance
Co. Ltd. has also emphasised that waiver "must be with knowledge, an essential supported by many
authorities". Now in the present case there is nothing to show that at the date when the appellant
addressed the letter dated 25th June, 1970, it had full knowledge of its right to exemption under the
assurance given by the 4th respondent and that it intentionally abandoned such right. It is difficult
to speculate what was the reason why the appellant addressed the letter dated 25th June, 1970
stating that it would avail of the concessional rates of sales tax granted under the letter dated 20th
January, 1970. It is possible that the appellant might have thought that since no notification
exempting the appellant from sales tax had been issued by the State Government under section 4A,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 17M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

the appellant was legally not entitled to exemption and that is why the appellant might have chosen
to accept whatever concession was being granted by the State Government. The claim of the
appellant to exemption could be sustained only on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and this
doctrine could not be said to be so well defined in its scope and ambit and so free from uncertainty
in its application that we should be compelled to hold that the appellant must have had knowledge
of its right to exemption on the basis of promissory estoppel at the time when it addressed the letter
dated 25th June, 1970. In fact, in the petition as originally filed, the right to claim total exemption
from sales tax was not based on the plea of promissory estoppel which was introduced only by way
of amendment. Moreover, it must be remembered that there is no presumption that every person
knows the law. It is often said that every one is presumed to know the law, but that is not a correct
statement: there is no such maxim known to the law. Over a hundred and thirty years ago, Maule, J.,
pointed out in Martindala v. Faulkner(3): "There is no presumption in this country that every
person knows the law: it would be contrary to common sense and reason if it were so". Scrutton,
also once said: "It is impossible to know all the statutory law, and not very possible to know all the
common law." But it was Lord Atkin who, as in so many other spheres, put the point in its proper
context when he said in Evans v. Bartlem(1)" the fact is that there is not and never has been a
presumption that every one knows the law. There is the rule that ignorance of the law does not
excuse, a maxim of very different scope and application." It is, therefore, not possible to presume, in
the absence of any material placed before the Court, that the appellant had full knowledge of its
right to exemption so as to warrant an inference that the appellant waived such right by addressing
the letter dated 25th June, 1970. We accordingly reject the plea of waiver raised on behalf of the
State Government.

That takes us to the question whether the assurance given by the 4th respondent on behalf of the
State Government that the appellant would be exempt from sales tax for a period of three years from
the date of commencement of production could be enforced against the State Government by
invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Though the origin of the doctrine of promissory
estoppel may be found in Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co.(2) and Birmingham & District Land
Co. v. London & North-Western Rail Co.(3) authorities of old standing decided about a century ago
by the House of Lords, it was only recently in 1947 that it was rediscovered by Mr. Justice Denning,
as he then was, in his celebrated judgment in Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees
House Ltd.(4) This doctrine has been variously called 'promissory estoppel’, ‘equitable estoppel’,
‘quasi estoppel’ and 'new estoppel’. It is a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice and though
commonly named ‘promissory estoppel, it is, as we shall presently point out, neither in the realm of
contract nor in the realm of estoppel. It is interesting to trace the evolution of this doctrine in
England and to refer to some of the English decisions in order to appreciate the true scope and
ambit of the doctrine particularly because it has been the subject of considerable recent
development and is steadily expanding. The basis of this doctrine is the inter-position of equity.
Equity has always, true to form, stepped into mitigate the rigours of strict law. The early cases did
not speak of this doctrine as estoppel. They spoke of it as 'raising an equity’. Lord Cairns stated the
doctrine in its earliest form-it has undergone considerable development since then-in the following
words in Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Company (supra):

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 18M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

"It is the first principle upon which all Courts of Equity proceed, that if parties who
have entered into definite and distinct terms involving certain legal
results....afterwards by their own act or with their own consent enter upon a course of
negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict
rights arising under the contract will not be enforced, or will be kept in suspense, or
held in abeyance, the person who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not
be allowed to enforce them where it would be inequitable having regard to the
dealings which have thus taken place between the parties."

This principle of equity laid down by Lord Cairns made sporadic appearances in stray cases now and
then but it was only in 1947 that it was disinterred and restated as a recognised doctrine by Mr.
Justice Denning, as he then was, in the High Trees' case (supra). The facts in that case were as
follows: The plaintiffs leased to the defendents, a subsidiary of the plaintiffs, in 1937 a block of flats
for 99 years at a rent of & 2500/- a year. Early in 1940 and because of the war, the defendants were
unable to find sub- tenants for the flats and unable in consequence to pay the rent. The plaintiffs
agreed at the request of the defendants to reduce the rent to &. 1250/- from the beginning of the
term. By the beginning of 1945 the conditions had improved and tenants had been found for all the
flats and the plaintiffs, therefore, claimed the full rent of the premises from the middle of that year.
The claim was allowed because the court took the view that the period for which the full rent was
claimed fell out side the representation, but Mr. Justice Denning, as he then was, considered Obiter
whether the plaintiffs could have recovered the covenanted rent for the whole period of the lease
and observed that in equity the plaintiffs could not have been allowed to act inconsistently with their
promise on which the defendants had acted. It was pressed upon the Court that according to the well
settled law as laid down in Jorden y. Money(1), no estoppel could be raised against plaintiffs since
the doctrine of estoppel by representation is applicable only to representations as to some state of
facts alleged to be at the time actually in existence and not to promises de futuro which, if binding at
all, must be binding only as contracts and here there was no representa
tion of an existing state of facts by the plaintiffs but it was merely a promise or representation of
intention to act in a particular manner in the future. Mr. Justice Denning, however, pointed out:

"The law has not been standing still since Jorden v. Money. There has been a series of
decisions over the last fifty years which, although they are said to be cases of estoppel
are not really such. They are cases in which a promise was made which was intended
to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the
promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made, and which was
in fact so acted on. In such cases the courts have said that the promise must be
honoured."

The principle formulated by Mr. Justice Denning was, to quote his own words, "that a promise
intended to be binding, intended to be acted on and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms
properly apply". Now Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co. (supra) and Birmingham and District
Land Co. v. London & North Western Rail Co. (supra), the two decisions from which Mr. Justice
Denning drew inspiration for evolving this new equitable principle, were clearly cases where the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 19M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

principle was applied as between parties who were already bound contractually one to the other. In
Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co. (supra) the plaintiff and the defendant were already bound in
contract and the general principle stated by Lord Cairns, L.C. was:

"If parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms involving certain legal
results afterwards-enter upon a course of negotiations".

Ten years later Bowen, L. J. also used the same terminology in Birmingham and District Land Co. v.
London and North Western Rail Co. (supra) that:

"If persons who have contractual rights against others induce by their conduct those
against whom they have such rights to believe----- .

These two decisions might, therefore, seem to suggest that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is
limited in its operation to cases where the parties are already contractually bound and one of the
parties induces the other to believe that the strict rights under the contract would not be enforced.
But we do not think any such limitation can justifiably be introduced to curtail the width and
amplitude of this doctrine. We fail to see why it should be necessary to the applicability of this
doctrine that there should be some contractual relationship between the parties. In fact Donaldson,
J. pointed out in Durham Fancy Goods Ltd. v. Michael Jackson (Fancy Goods) Ltd. (1) :

"Lord Cairns in his enunciation of the principle assumed a pre-existing contractual
relationship between the parties, but this does not seem to me to be essential,
provided that there is a pre-existing legal relationship which could in certain
circumstances give rise to liabilities and penalties."

But even this limitation suggested by Donaldson, J.

that there should be-a pre-existing legal relationship which could in certain circumstances give rise
to liabilities and penalties is not warranted and it is significant that the statement of the doctrine by
Mr. Justice Denning in the High Trees' case does not contain any such limitation. The learned Judge
has consistently refused to introduce any such limitation in the doctrine and while sitting in the
Court of Appeal, he said in so many terms, in Evenden v. Guildford City Association Football Club
Ltd.(2) "Counsel for the appellant referred us, however, to the second edition of Spencer Bower's
book on Estoppel by Representation[(1966) pp. 340-342] by Sir Alexander Turner, a judge of the
New Zealand Court of Appeal. He suggests the promissory estoppel is limited to cases where parties
are already bound contractually one to the other. I do not think it is so limited : see Durham Fancy
Goods Ltd. v. Michael Jackson (Fancy Goods) Ltd. It applies whenever a representation is made,
whether of fact or law, present or future, which is intended to be binding, intended to induce a
person to act on it and he does act on it."

This observation of Lord Denning clearly suggest that the parties need not be in any kind of legal
relationship before the transaction from which the promissory estoppel takes its origin. The doctrine

would seem to apply even where there is no pre-existing legal relationship between the parties, but

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 20M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

the promise is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship which will arise in
future. Vide Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed. Vol. 16 p. 1018, Note 2 para 1514. Of course it must
be pointed out in fairness to Lord Denning that he made it clear in the High Trees' case that the
doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot found a cause of action in itself, since it can never do away
with the necessity of consideration in the formation of a contract, but he totally repudiated in
Evenden's case the necessity of a pre-existing relationship between the parties and pointed out in
Crabb v. Arun District Council(1) that equity will in a given case where justice and fairness demand,
prevent a person from insisting on strict legal rights even where they arise, not under any contract,
but on his own title deeds or under statue. The true principle of promissory estoppel, therefore
seems to be that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and
unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship to arise
in the future, knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the
promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party, the promise would be binding on
the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be inequitable to
allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties, and
this would be so irrespective whether there is any preexisting relationship between the parties or
not.

It may be pointed out that in England the law has been well-settled for a long time, though there is
some indication of a contrary trend to be found in recent juristic thinking in that country, that
promissory estoppel cannot itself be the basis of an action. It cannot found a cause of action : it can
only be a shield and not a sword. This narrow approach to a doctrine which is otherwise full of great
potentialities is largely the result of an assumption, encouraged by it rather misleading
nomenclature, that the doctrine is a branch of the law of estoppel. Since estoppel has always been
traditionally a principle invoked by way of defence, the doctrine of promissory estoppel has also
come to be identified as a measure of defence. The ghost of traditional estoppel continues to haunt
this new doctrine and that is why we find that while boldly formulating and applying this new equity
in the High Trees' case, Lord Denning added a qualification that though in the circumstances set
out, the promise would undoubtedly be held by the courts to be binding on the party making it,
notwithstanding that under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it.
"the courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a
promise, but they have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it". Lord
Denning also pointed out in Combe v.

Combe(2) that "Much as I am inclined to favour the principles stated in the High Trees’ case, it is
important that it should not be stretched too far, lest it should be endangered. That principle does
not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting
upon his strict legal rights, when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them, having regard to
the dealings which have taken place between the parties......" So also said Buckley, J., in the more
recent case of Beesly v. Hallwood Estates Ltd.(1) "The doctrine may afford a defence against the
enforcement or otherwise of enforceable rights : it cannot create a cause of action." It is, however,
necessary to make it clear that though this doctrine has been called in various judgments and text
books as promissory estoppel and it has been variously described as ‘equitable estoppel’, “quasi
estoppel’ and ‘new estoppel, it is not really based on the principle of estoppel, but it is a doctrine

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 21M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

evolved by equity in order to prevent injustice where a promise is made by a person knowing that it
would be acted on by the person to whom it is made and in fact it is so acted on and it is inequitable
to allow the party making the promise to go back upon it. Lord Denning himself observed in the
High Trees' case, expressly making a distinction between ordinary estoppel and promissory estoppel
that cases like the one before him were" not cases of estoppel in the strict sense. They are really
promises, promises intended to be binding, intended to be acted upon and in fact acted upon".
Jenkins, C.J. also pointed out in Municipal Corporation of Bombay v. Secretary of State (2) that the
"doctrine is often treated as one of estoppel but I doubt whether this is correct, though it may be a
convenient name to apply". The doctrine of promissory estoppel need not, therefore, be inhibited by
the same limitation as estoppel in the strict sense of the term. It is an equitable principle evolved by
the courts for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application
by way of defence.

It may be noted that even Lord Denning recognised in Crabb v. Arun Distric Council (supra) that
"there are estoppels and estoppels. Some do give rise to a cause of action. Some don't" and added
that "in the species of estoppel called ‘proprietary estoppel’, it does give rise to a cause of action"
The learned Law Lord, after quoting what he had said in Moorgate Mercantile Co. Ltd. v.
Twitchings,(3) namely that the effect of estoppel on the true owner may be that :

"his own title to the property, be it land or goods, has been held to be limited or
extinguished, and new rights and interests have been created therein. And this
operates by reason of his conduct-what he has led the other to believe-even though he
never intended it."

Proceeded to observe that "the new rights and interests, so created by estoppel, in or over land, will
be protected by the courts and in this way give rise to a cause of action". The Court of Appeal in this
case allowed Crabb a declaration of "a right of access at point over the verge on to Mill Park Road
and a right of way along that road to Hook Lane" on the basis of an equity arising out of the conduct
of the Arun District Council. Of course, Spencer Bower and Turner, in their Treatise on ‘The Law
Relating to Estoppel by Representation’ have explained this decision on the basis that it is an
instance of the application of the doctrine of estoppel by encouragement or acquiescence or what
has now come to be known as proprietary estoppel which, according to the learned authors, forms
an exception to the rule that estoppel cannot found a cause of action. But if we look at the judgments
of Lord Denning and Scarman, L.J., it is apparent that they did not base their decision on any
distinctive feature of proprietary estoppel but proceeded on the assumption that there was no
distinction between promissory and proprietary estoppel so far as the problem before them was
concerned. Both the learned Law Lord and the learned Lord Justice applied the principle of
promissory estoppel in giving relief to Crabb. Lord Denning, referring to what Lord Cairns had said
in Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co.,(1) a decision from which inspiration was drawn by him for
evolving the doctrine of promissory estoppel in the High Tree's case, observed that "- it is the first
principle on which all courts of equity proceed......that it will prevent person from insisting on his
strict legal rights-whether arising under a contract, or on his title deeds, or by statute-when it would
be inequitable for him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the
parties". The decision in the High Trees' case was also referred to the learned Law Lord and so also

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 22M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

other cases supporting the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Scarman, L.J. also observed that in
pursuing the inquiry as to whether there was an equity in favour of Crabb, he did not find helpful
"the distinction between promissory and proprietary estoppel". He added that this "distinction may
indeed be valuable to those who have to teach or expound the law, but I do not think that, in solving
the particular problem raised by a particular case, putting the law into categories is of the slightest
assistance". It does appear to us that this was a case deci
ded on the principle of promissory estoppel. The representative of the Arun District Council clearly
gave assurance to Crabb that they would give him access to the new road at point B to serve the
southern portion of his land and the Arun District Council in fact constructed a gate at point B, and
in the belief induced by this representation that he would have right of access to the new road at
point B, Crabb agreed to sell the northern portion of his land without reserving for himself as owner
of the southern portion any right of way over the northern portion for the purpose of access to the
new road. This was the reason why the Court raised an equity in favour of Crabb and held that the
equity would be satisfied by giving Crabb "the right of access at point B free of charge without paying
anything for it". Arun District Council was held bound by its promise to provide Crabb access to the
new road at point B and this promise was enforced against Arun District Council at the instance of
Crabb. The case was one which fell within the category of promissory estoppel and it may be
regarded as supporting the view that promissory estoppel can be the basis of a cause of action. It is
possible that the case also came within the rule of proprietary estoppel enunciated by Lord
Kingsdown in Ramsden v. Dyson(1) :

"The rule of law applicable to the case appears to me to be this : If a man, under a
verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or what amounts to
the same thing, under an expectation, created or encouraged by the landlord that he
shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land, with the consent of the
landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of
the land lord, and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of
equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation."

and Spencer Bower and Turner may be right in observing that that was perhaps the reason why it
was held that the promise made by Arun District Council gave rise to a cause of action in favour of
Crabb. But, on what principle, one may ask, is the distinction to be sustained between promissory
estoppel and proprietary estoppel in the matter of enforcement by action. If proprietary estoppel can
furnish a cause of action, why should promissory estoppel not ? There is no qualitative difference
between the two. Both are the off- springs of equity and if equity is flexible enough to permit
proprietary estoppel to be used as a cause of action, there is no reason in logic or principle why
promissory estoppel should also not be available as a cause of action, if necessary to satisfy the
equity.

But perhaps the main reason why the English Courts have been reluctant to allow promissory
estoppel to found a cause of action seems to be the apprehension that the doctrine of consideration
would other wise be completely displaced. There can be no doubt that the decision of Lord Denning
in the High Trees' case represented a bold attempt to escape from the limitation imposed by the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 23M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

House of Lords in Jorden v. Money (supra) and it rediscovered an equity which was long embedded
beneath the crust of the old decisions in Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co. (supra) and
Birmingham and District Land Co. v. London and North Western Rail Co. (supra), and brought
about a remarkable development in the law with a view to ensuring its approximation with justice,
an ideal for which the law has been constantly striving. But it is interesting to note the Lord Denning
was not prepared to go further, as he thought that having regard to the doctrine of consideration
which was so deeply entrenched in the jurisprudence of the country, it might be unwise to extend
promissory estoppel so as to found a cause of action and that is why he uttered a word of caution in
Combe v. Combe (supra) that the principle of promissory estoppel "should not be stretched too far,
lest it should be endangered". The learned Law Lord proceeded to add "seeing that the principle
never stands alone as giving a cause of action in itself, it can never do away with the necessity of
consideration when that is an essential part of the cause of action. The doctrine of consideration is
too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side wind." Spencer Bower and Turner also point out at page
384 of their Treatise (3rd ed) that it is difficult to see how in a case of promissory estoppel a promise
can be used to found a cause of action without according to it operative contractual force and it is for
this reason that "a contention that a promissory estoppel may be used to found a cause of action
must be regarded as an attack on the doctrine of consideration." The learned authors have also
observed at page 387 that "to give a plaintiff a cause of action on a promissory estoppel must be little
less than to allow an action in contract where consideration is not shown" and that cannot be done
because consideration "still remains a cardinal necessity of the formation of a contract." It can
hardly be disputed that over the last three or four centuries the doctrine of consideration has come
to occupy such a predominant position in the law of contract that under the English law it is
impossible to think of a contract without consideration and, therefore, it is understandable that the
English courts should have hesitated to push the doctrine of promissory estoppel to its logical
conclusion and stopped short at allowing it to be used merely as a weapon of defence, though, as we
shall point out, there are, quite a few cases where this doctrine has been used not as founding a
cause of action in itself but as a part of a cause of a action.

The modern attitude towards the doctrine of consideration is, however, changing fast and there is
considerable body of juristic thought which believes that this doctrine is "something of an
anchronism". Prof. Holdsworth pointed out long ago in his History of English Law that "the
requirements of consideration in its present shape prevent the enforcement of many contracts,
which ought to be enforced, if the law really wishes to give effect to the lawful intentions of the
parties to them; and it would prevent the enforcement of many others, if the judges had not used
their ingenuity to invest considerations. But the invention of considerations, by reasoning which is
both devious and technical, adds to the difficulties of the doctrine". Lord Wright remarked in an
article published in 49 Harvard Law Review, 1225 that the doctrine of consideration in its present
form serves no practical purpose and ought to be abolished. Sir Federick Pollock also said in his well
known work of *Ganius of Common Law’, p. 91 that the application of the doctrine of consideration"
to various unusual but not unknown cases has been made subtle and obscured by excessive dialectic
refinement". Equally strong is the condemnation of this doctrine in judicial pronouncements. Lord
Duned observed in the well known case of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge and Co. Ltd.(4) "I
confess that this case is to my mind apt to nip any budding affection which one might have had for
the doctrine of consideration. For the effect of that doctrine in the present case is to make it possible

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 24M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

for a person to snap his fingers at a bargain deliberately made, a bargain not in itself unfair, and
which the person seeking to enforce it has a legitimate interest to enforce." The doctrine of
consideration has also received severe criticism at the hands of Dean Roscoe Pound in the United
States. The reason is that promise as a social and economic institution becomes of the first
importance in a commercial and industrial society and it is an expression of the moral sentiment of
a civilised society that a man's word should be “as good as his bond' and his fellow-men should be
able to rely on the one equally with the other. That is why the Law Revision Committee in England
in its Sixth Report made as far back as 1937 accepted Prof. Holdsworth's view and advocated that a
contract should exist if it was intended to create or affect legal relations and either consideration
was present or the contract was reduced to writing. This recommendation, however, did not fructify
into law with the result that the present position remains what it was. But having regard to the
general opprobrium to which the doctrine of consideration has been subjected by eminent jurists,
we need not be unduly anxious to project this doctrine against assault or erosion nor allow it to
dwarf or stultify the full development of the equity of promissory estoppel or inhibit or curtail its
operational efficacy as a justice device for preventing injustice. It may be pointed out that the Law
Commission of India in its 13th Report adopted the same approach and recommended that, by way
of exception to section 25 of the Indian Contract Act, 1925, a promise, express or implied, which the
promisor knows or reasonably should know, will be relied upon by the promisee, should be
enforceable, if the promisee has altered his position to his detriment in reliance on the promise. We
do not see any valid reason why promissory estoppel should not be allowed to found a cause of
action where, in order to satisfy the equity, it is necessary to do so.

We may point out that even in England where the judges apprehending that if a cause of action is
allowed to be founded on promissory estoppel it would considerably erode, if not completely
overthrow, the doctrine of consideration, have been fearful to allow promissory estoppel to be used
as a weapon of offence, it is interesting to find that promissory estoppel has not been confined to a
purely defensive role. Lord Denning himself said in Combe v. Combe (supra) that promissory
estoppel "may be a part of a cause of action", though "not a cause of action itself". In fact there have
been several cases where promissory estoppel has been successfully invoked by a party to support
his cause of action, without actually founding his cause of action exclusively upon it. Two such cases
are : Robertson v. Minister of Pensions(1) and Evenden v. Guildford City Association Football Club
Ltd.(2) The English courts have thus gone a step forward from the original position when
promissory estoppel was regarded merely as a passive equity and allowed it to be used as a weapon
of offence to a limited extent as a part of the cause of action, but still the doctrine of consideration
continues to inhibit the judicial mind and that has thwarted the full development of this new
equitable principle and the realisation of its vast potential as a juristic technique for doing justice. It
is true that to allow promissory estoppel to found a cause of action would seriously dilute the
principle which requires consideration to support a contractual obligation, but that is no reason why
this new principle, which is a child of equity brought into the world with a view to promoting
honesty and good faith and bringing law closer to justice should be held in fetters and not allowed to
operate in all the activist magnitude, so that it may fulfil the purpose for which it was conceived and
born. It must be remembered that law is not a mausoleum. It is not an antique to be taken down,
dusted, admired and put back on the shelf. It is rather like an old vigorous tree, having its roots in
history, yet continuously taking new grafts and putting out new sprouts and occasionally dropping

dead wood. It is essentially a social process, the end product of which is justice and hence it must
keep on growing and developing with changing social concepts and values. Otherwise, there will be
estrangement between law and justice and law will cease to have legitimacy. It is true as pointed out
by Mr. Justice Holmes, that continuity with the past is a historical necessity but it must also be
remembered at the same time, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Cardozo that "conformity is not to be
turned into a "fetish". We would do well to recall the famous words uttered by Mr. Justice Cardozo
while closing his first lecture on "Paradoxes of Legal Science";

"The disparity between precedent and ethos may so lengthen with the years that only
covin and chicenery would be disappointed if the separation were to end. There are
many intermediate stages, mores, if inadequate to obliterate the past, may fix
direction for the future. The evil precedent may live, but so sterilized and truncated
as to have small capacity for harm. It will be prudently ignored when invoked as an
apposite analogy in novel situations, though the novel element be small. There will be
brought forward other analogies, less precise, it may be, but more apposite to the
needs of morals. The weights are constantly shifted to restore the equilibrium
between precedent and justice."

Was it not Lord Denning who exhorted judges not to be timorous sours but to be bold spirits, ready
to allow a new cause of action if justice so required. (Candler v. Crane Christmas & Co.(1) We may
profitably consider at this stage what the American law on the subject is because in the United States
the law has always shown a greater capacity for adjustment and growth than elsewhere. The
doctrine of promissory estoppel has displayed remarkable vigour and vitality in the hands of
American Judges and it is still rapidly developing and expanding in the United States. It may be
pointed out that this development does not derive its origin in any way from the decision of Lord
Denning in the High Trees' case but ante-dates this decision by a number of years; perhaps it is
possible that it may have helped to inspire that decision. It was long before the decision in the High
Trees'case that the American Law Institute's Restatement of the Law of Contract's came out with the
following proposition in Article 90 :

"A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or
forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee, and
which does induce such action or forbearance, is binding if injustice can be avoided
only by enforcement of the promise."

This proposition was explained and elucidated by several illustrations given in the article and one of
such illustrations was as follows :

"A promises B to pay him an annuity during B's life. B thereupon resigns a profitable
employment, as A expected that he might. B receives the annuity for some years, in
the meantime becoming disqualified from again obtaining good employment. A's
promise is binding."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 26M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

It is true that the Restatement has not the same weight, as a source of law, as actual decisions of
courts of high standing, yet the principle set out in Article 90 has in fact formed the basis of a
number of decisions in various states and it is now becoming increasingly clear that a promise may
in the United States derive contractual enforceability if it has been made by the promisor intending
that it would be acted on and the promisee has altered his position in reliance on it, notwithstanding
that there is no consideration in the sense in which that word is used in English and Commonwealth
jurisprudence. Of course the basic requirement for invoking this principle must be present namely,
that the fact situation should be such that "injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the
promise". There are numerous examples of the application of this principle to be found in recent
American decisions. There is, for instance, the long line of cases in which a promise to give a
charitable subscription has been consistently held to be enforceable at the suit of the charity.
Though attempts have been made to justify these decisions by reasoning that the charity by
commencing or continuing its charitable work after receiving promise has given good consideration
for it, we do not think that, on closer scrutiny, the enforceability of the promise in these cases can be
supported by spelling out the presence of some form of consideration and the true principle on
which they are really based is the principle of promissory estoppel. This is also the view expressed in
the following statement at page 657 of vol. 19 of American Jurisprudence :

"A number of courts have upheld the validity of charitable subscriptions on the
theory of promissory estoppel holding that while a mere promise to contribute is
unenforceable for want of consideration, if money has been expended or liabilities
have been incurred in reliance on the promise so that non fulfillment will cause
injury to the payee, the donor is estopped to assert the lack of consideration, and the
promise will be enforced."

Chief Justice Cardozo, presiding over the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, explained the
ratio of these decisions in the same terms in Alleghany College v. National Chauteuque County
Bank(a):

"The half-truths of one generation tend at times to perpetuate themselves in the law
as the whole truths of another, when constant repetition brings it about that
qualifications, taken once for granted, are disregarded or forgotten. The doctrine of
consideration has not escaped the common lot. As far back as 1881, Judge Holmes in
his lectures on the Common Law (p. 292) separated the detriment which is merely a
consequence of the promise from the detriment, which is in truth the motive or
inducement, and yet added that the courts ‘have gone far in obliterating this
distinction’. The tendency toward effacement has not lessened with the years. On the
contrary there has grown up of recent days a doctrine that a substitute for
consideration or an exception to its ordinary requirements can be found in what is
styled a ‘promissory estoppel’. Williston, Contract, Ss. 139, 116. Whether the
exception has made its way in this State to such an extent as to permit us to say that
the general law of consideration has been modified accordingly, we do not now
attempt to say. Cases such as 234 N.Y. 479 and 221 N.Y. 431-may be signposts on the
road. Certain at least it is that we have adopted the doctrine of promissory estoppel as

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 27M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

the equivalent of consideration in connection with our law of charitable
subscriptions. So long as those decisions stand, the question is not merely whether
the enforcement of a charitable subscription can be squared with the doctrine of
consideration in all its ancient rigor. The question may also be whether it can be
squared with the doctrine of consideration as qualified by the doctrine of promissory
estoppel".

We have said that the cases in this State have recognized this exception, if exception it is thought to
be. Thus, in 12 N.Y. 18 the subscription was made without request, express or implied that the
church do anything on the faith of it. Later, the church did incur expense to the knowledge of the
promisor, and in the reasonable belief that the promise would be kept. We held the promise binding,
though consideration there was none except upon the theory of a promissory estoppel. In 74 N.Y. 72
a situation substantially the same became the basis for a like ruling. So in 103 N.Y. 600 and (1901)
167 N.Y. 96 the moulds of consideration as fixed by the old doctrine were subject to a like expansion.
Very likely, conceptions of public policy have shaped, more or less subconsciously, the rulings thus
made. Judges have been affected by the thought that 'defences of that character' are ‘breaches of
faith towards the public, and especially towards those engaged in the same enterprise, and an
unwarrantable disappointment of the reasonable expectations of those interested’. W. F. Allen J. in
12 N.Y. 18 and of 97 Vt. 495 and cases there cited. The result speaks for itself irrespective of the
motive. Decisions which have stood so long, and which are supported by so many considerations of
public policy and reason, will not be over-ruled to save the symmetry of a concept which itself came
into our law, not so much from any reasoned conviction of its justice, as from historical accidents of
practice and procedure. (8 Holdsworth, History of English Law, 7 et. seq). The concept survives as
one of the distinctive features of our legal system. We have no thought to suggest that it is obsolete
or on the way to be abandoned. As in the case of other concepts, however, the pressure of exceptions
has led to irregularities of form."

It is also interesting to note that the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been widely used in the
United States in diverse other situations as founding a cause of action. The most notable instances
are to be found in what may be called the "sub-contractor bid cases" in which a contractor about to
tender for a contract, invites a sub- contractor to submit a bid for a sub-contract and after receiving
his bid the contractor submits a tender. In such cases, the sub-contractor has been held unable to
retract his bid and be liable in damages if he does so. It is not possible to say that any detriment
which the contractor may be able to show in these cases would amount to consideration in its strict
sense and these decisions have plainly been reached on an application of the doctrine of promissory
estoppel. One of such cases was Drennan v. Star Paving Company(1) where Traynor, J. explicitly
adopted as good law the text of Article 90 of the Restatement of the law of Contracts quoted above
and stated in so many words that "the absence of consideration is not fatal to the enforcement of
such a promise". There are also numerous cases where the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been
applied against the Government where the interest of justice, morality and common fairness clearly
dictated such a course. We shall refer to these cases when we discuss the applicability of the doctrine
of equitable estoppel against the Government. Suffice it to state for the present that the doctrine of
promissory estoppel has been taken much further in the United States than in English and
Commonwealth jurisdictions and in some States at least, it has been used to reduce, if not to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 28M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

destroy, the prestige of consideration as an essential of valid contract. Vide Spencer Bower and
Turner's Estoppel by Representation (2d) page 358.

We now go on to consider whether and if so to what extent is the doctrine of promissory estoppel
applicable against the Government. So far as the law in English is concerned, the position cannot be
said to be very clear. Rowlett J., in an early decision in Rederiaktiebolaget Amphitrite v. The King(1)
held that an undertaking given by the British Government to certain neutral ship owners during the
First World War that if the shipowners sent a particular ship to the United Kingdom with a specified
cargo, she shall not be detained, was not enforceable against the British Government in a court of
law and observed that his main reason for taking this view was that:

"--it is not competent for the Government to fetter its future executive action, which
must necessarily be determined by the needs of the community when the question
arises. It cannot by contract hamper its freedom of action in matters which concern
the welfare of the State."

This observation has however not been regarded by jurists as laying down the correct law on the
subject since it is "very wide and it is difficult to determine its proper scope". Anson's English Law of
Contract, 22d. 174. The doctrine of executive necessity propounded by Rowlatt, J., was in fact
disapproved by Denning, J., as he then was, in Roberston v. Minister of Pensions (supra) where the
learned Judge said:

The Crown cannot escape by saying that estoppels do not bind the Crown for that
doctrine has long been exploded. Nor can the Crown escape by praying in aid the
doctrine of executive necessity, that is, the doctrine that the Crown cannot bind itself
so as to fetter its future executive action. That doctrine was propounded by Rowlatt,
J., in Rederiak-tiebolaget Amphitrite v. The King but it was unnecessary for the
decision because the statement there was not a promise which was intended to be
binding but only an expression of intention. Rowlatt, J., seems to have been
influenced by the cases on the right of the Crown to dismiss its servants at pleasure,
but those cases must now all be read in the light of the judgment of Lord Atkin in
Reily v. The King-(1954) A.C. 176, 176).-In my opinion the defence of executive
necessity is of limited scope. It only avails the Crown where there is an implied term
to that effect or that is the true meaning of the contract."

It is true that the decision of Denning J., in this case was overruled by the House of Lords in Howell
v. Falmouth Boat Construction Co. Ltd. (1) but that was on the ground that the doctrine of
promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to "bar the Crown from enforcing a statutory prohibition or
entitle the subject to maintain that there has been no breach of it". The decision of the House of
Lords did not express any disapproval of the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel
against the Crown nor did it overrule the view taken by Denning J., that the Crown cannot escape its
obligation under the doctrine of promissory estoppel by "praying in aid the doctrine of executive
necessity." The statement of the law by Denning, J., may, therefore, still be regarded as holding the
field and it may be taken to be a judicially favoured view that the Crown is not immune from liability

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 29M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

The courts in America for a long time took the view that the doctrine of promissory estoppel does
not apply to the Government but more recently the courts have started retreating from that position
to a sounder one, namely, that the doctrine of promissory estoppel may apply to the Government
when justice so requires. The second edition of American Jurisprudence brought out in 1966 in
paragraph 123 points out that "equitable estoppel will be invoked against the State when justified by
the facts", though it does warn that this doctrine "should not be lightly invoked against the State."
Later in the same paragraph it is stated that "as a general rule, the doctrine of estoppel will not be
applied against the State in its governmental, public or sovereign capacity", but a qualification is
introduced that promissory estoppel may be applied against the State even in its governmental,
public or sovereign capacity if "its application is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice”.
Since 1966 there is an increasing trend towards applying the doctrine of promissory estoppel against
the State and the old law that promissory estoppel does not apply against the government is
definitely declining. There have been numerous cases in the State courts where it has been held that
promissory estoppel may be applied even against the Govern
ment in its governmental capacity where the accommodation of the needs of justice to the needs of
effective government so requires.

The protagonists of the view that promissory estoppel cannot apply against the Government or a
public authority seek to draw inspiration from the majority decision of the United States Supreme
Court in Federal Crop Insurance Corporation v. Merrill.(1) But we do not think that decision can be
read as laying down the proposition that the doctrine of promissory estoppel can never be invoked
against the Government. There the County Committee acting as the agent of the Federal Crop
Insurance Corporation which was a wholly Government-owned corporation constituted under the
Federal Crop Insurance Act, advised the respondents that their entire 460 acres of spring wheat
crop which included spring wheat reseeded. On winter wheat acreage was insurable and acting upon
it, the respondents made an application for insurance which was forwarded by the County
Committee to the Denver office of the Corporation with a recommendation for acceptance. The
application did not mention that any part of the insured crop was reseeded and it was accepted by
the Denver office of the Corporation. There were at this time wheat crop insurance regulations
framed by the Corporation and published in the Federal Register which prohibited insurance of
spring wheat reseeded on winter wheat acreage but neither the respondents nor the County
Committees which was acting as the agent of the Corporation was aware of them. A few months
later, most of the respondent's crop was destroyed by drought and on a claim being made by the
respondents under the policy of insurance, the Corporation refused to pay the loss on the ground
that the wheat crop insurance regulations expressly prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat. The
refusal was upheld by the Supreme Court by a majority of five to four. The majority observed:

"It is too late in the day to urge that the Government is just another private litigant,
for purposes of charging it with liability, whenever it takes over a business
theretofore conducted by private enterprises or engages in competitions with private
ventures. Whatever the form in which the Government functions, anyone entering

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 30M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

into an arrangement with the Government takes the risk of having accurately
ascertained that be who purports to act for the Government stays within the bounds
of his authority And this is so even though as here, the agent himself may have been
unaware of the limitations upon his autho
rity.-"Man must turn square corners when they deal with the Government", does not
reflect a callous outlook. It merely expresses the duty of all courts to observe the
conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury."

It will be seen that the Corporation was held entitled to repudiate its liability because the wheat crop
insurance regulations prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat and the assurance given by the
County Committee as the agent of the Corporation that the reseeded wheat was insurable being
contrary to the wheat crop insurance regulations, could not be held binding on the Corporation. It
was not within the authority of the County Committee to give such assurance contrary to the wheat
crop insurance regulations and hence no promissory estoppel against the Corporation could be
founded upon it. This decision did not say that even if an assurance given by an agent is within the
scope of his authority and is not prohibited by law, it could still not create promissory estoppel
against the Government. But, it may be pointed out, even this limited holding has come in for
considerable criticism at the hands of jurists in the United States. See Davis on Administrative Law
(3rd d.) pages 344-345. Referring to the observation of the majority that "Men must turn square
corners when they deal with the Government", Maguire and Zimet have poetically responded by
saying: "It is hard to see why the Government should not be held to a like standard of rectangular
rectitude when dealing with its citizens." (Maguire and Zimet, Hobson's Choice and Similar
Practices in Federal Taxation, 48 Harv. L. Rev. 1287 at 1299).

There has so far not been any decision of the Supreme Court of the United States taking the view
that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked against the Government. The trend in
the State courts, of late, has been strongly in favour of the application of the doctrine of promissory
estoppel against the Government and public bodies "where interests of justice, morality and
common fairness clearly dictate that course." It is being increasingly felt that "that the Government
ought to set a high standard in its dealings and relationships with citizens and the word of a duly
authorised Government agent, acting within the scope of his authority ought to be as good as a
Government bond". Of course, as pointed out by the United States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit in
Valsonavich v. United States, (1) the Government would not be estopped "by the acts of its officers
and agents who without authority enter into agreements to do what the law does not sanction or
permit" and "those dealing with an agent of the Government must be held to have notice of
limitations of his authority" as held in Merrill's case. This is precisely what the House of Lords also
held in England in Howell v. Falmouth Boat Construction Co. Ltd. (supra) where Lord Simonds
stated the law to be:

"The illegality of an act is the same whether or not the actor has been misled by an
assumption of authority on the part of a Government officer however high or low in
the hierachy. The question is whether the character of an act done in face of a
statutory prohibition is affected by the fact that it has been induced by a misleading

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 31M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

assumption of authority. In my opinion the answer is clearly no."

But if the acts or omissions of the officers of the Government are within the scope of their authority
and are not otherwise impermissible under the law, they "will work estoppel against the
Government."

When we turn to the Indian law on the subject it is heartening to find that in India not only has the
doctrine of promissory estoppel been adopted in its fullness but it has been recognized as affording a
cause of action to the person to whom the promise is made. The requirement of consideration has
not been allowed to stand in the way of enforcement of such promise. The doctrine of promissory
estoppel has also been applied against the Government and the defence based on executive necessity
has been categorically negatived. It is remarkable that as far back as 1880, long before the doctrine
of promissory estoppel was formulated by Denning, J., in England, A Division Bench of two English
Judges in the Calcutta High Court applied the doctrine of promissory estoppel and recognised a
cause of action founded upon it in the Ganges Manufacturing Co. v. Surajmuli and other(1). The
doctrine of promissory estoppel was also applied against the Government in a case subsequently
decided by the Bombay High Court in Municipal Corporation of Bombay v. The Secretary of
State.(2) The facts of this last-mentioned case in Municipal Corporation of Bombay v. The Secretary
of State (supra) are a little interesting and it would be profitable to refer to them. The Government
of Bombay, with a view to constructing an arterial road, requested the Municipal Commissioner to
remove certain fish and vegetable markets which obstructed the construction of the proposed road.
The Municipal Commissioner replied that the markets were vested in the Corporation of Justices
but that he was willing to vacate certain municipal stables which occupied a portion of the proposed
site if the Government would rent other land mentioned in his letter, to the Municipality at a
nominal rent, the Municipality undertaking to bear the expenses of levelling the same and permit
the Municipality to erect on such land "stables of wood and iron with nobble foundation to be
removed at six months’ notice on other suitable ground being provided by Government". The
Government accepted the suggestion of the Municipal Commissioner and sanctioned the application
of the Municipal Commissioner for a site for stabling on the terms set out above and the Municipal
Commissioner thereafter entered into possession of the land and constructed stables, workshops
and chawls on the same at considerable expense. Twenty-four years later the Government served a
notice on the Municipal Commissioner determining the tenancy and requesting the Municipal
Commissioner to deliver possession of the land within six months and in the mean time to pay rent
at the rate of Rs.12,000/- per month. The Municipal Corporation declined to hand over possession
of the land or to pay the higher rent and the Secretary of State for India thereupon filed a suit
against the Municipal Corporation for a declaration that the tenancy of the Municipality stood
determined and for an order directing the municipality to pay rent at the rate of Rs. 12,000/- per
month. The suit was resisted by the Municipal Corporation on the ground then the events which had
transpired had created an equity in favour of the Municipality which afforded an answer to the claim
of the Government to eject the Municipality. This defence was upheld by a Division Bench of the
High Court and Jenkins C.J., speaking on behalf of the Division Bench, pointed out that, in view of
the following facts, namely:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 32M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

"-the Municipality gave up the old stables, levelled the ground, and erected the
moveable staibles in 1866 in the belief that they had against the Government an
absolute right not to be turned out until not only the expiration of six months notice,
but also other suitable ground was furnished: that this belief is referable to an
expectation created by the Government that their enjoyment of the land would be in
accordance with this belief: and that the Government knew that the Municipality
were acting in this belief so created:"

an equity was created in favour of the Municipality which entitled it "to appeal to the Court for its
aid in assisting them to resist the Secretary of State's claim that they shall be ejected from the
ground". The learned Chief Justice pointed out that the doctrine which he was applying took its
origin "from the jurisdiction assumed by Courts of Equity to intervene in the case of or to prevent
fraud" and after referring to Ramsden v. Dyson(1) observed that the Crown also came within the
range of this equity. This decision of the Bombay High Court is a clear authority for the proposition
that it is open to a party who has acted on a representation made by the Government to claim that
the Government shall be bound to carry out the promise made by it, even though the promise is not
recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by the Constitution. That is how this decision
has in fact been interpreted by this court in Union of India v. Indo-Afghan Agencies:(2) We don't
find any decision of importance thereafter on the subject of promissory estoppel until we come to
the decision of this Court in Collector of Bombay v. Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay &
Ors.(3). The facts giving rise to this case were that in 1865 the Government of Bombay called upon
the predecessor in title of the Municipal Corporation of Bombay to remove old markets from a
certain site and vacate it and on the application of the Municipal Commissioner, the Government
passed a resolution approving and authorizing the grant of another site to the Municipality. The
resolution stated further that "the Government do not consider that any rent should be charged to
the Municipality as the markets will be like other public buildings, for the benefit of the whole
community". The Municipal Corporation gave up the site on which the old markets were situated
and spent a sum of Rs. 17 lakhs in erecting and maintaining markets on the new site. In 1940 the
Collector of Bombay assessed the new site to land revenue and the Municipal Corporation there
upon filed a suit for a declaration that the order of assessment was ultra vires and it was entitled to
hold the land for ever without payment of any assessment. The High Court of Bombay held that the
Government had lost its right to assess the land in question by reason of the equity arising on the
facts of the case in favour of the Municipal Corporation and there was thus a limitation on the right
of the Government to assess under section 8 of the Bom bay City Land Revenue Act. On appeal by
the Collector to this Court, the majority Judges held that the Government was not, under the
circumstances of the case, entitled to assess land revenue on the land in question because the
Municipal Corporation had taken possession of the land in terms of the Government resolution and
had continued in such possession openly, uninterruptedly and of right for over seventy years and
thereby acquired the limited title it had been prescribing for during the period, that is to say, the
right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent. Chandrasekhra Aiyar, J., agreed with the conclusion
reached by the majority but rested his decision on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. He pointed
out that the Government could not be allowed to go back on the representation made by it and
stressed the point in the form of an interrogation by asking: "if we do so, would it not amount to our
countenancing the perpetration of what can be compendiously described as legal fraud which a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 33M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

court of equity must prevent being committed?" He observed that even if the resolution of the
Government amounted merely to "the holding out of a promise that no rent will be charged in the
future, the Government must be deemed in the circumstances of this case to have bound themselves
to fulfil it. Whether it is the equity recognised in Ramsden's case (supra) or it is some other form of
equity, is not of much importance. Courts must do justice by the promotion of honesty and good
faith, as far as it lies in their power." This was of course the solitary view of Chandrasekhara Aiyer,
J., but it was approved by this Court in no uncertain terms in Indo-Afghan Agencies case (supra).

Then we come to the celebrated decision of this Court in the Indo-Afghan Agencies case (supra). It
was in this case that the doctrine of promissory estoppel found its most eloquent exposition. We
may briefly state the facts in order to appreciate the ratio of the decision. Indo-Afghan Agencies Ltd.
who were the respondents before the Court, acting in reliance on the Export Promotion Scheme
issued by the Central Government, exported woollen goods to Afghanistan and on the basis of their
exports claimed to be entitled to obtain from the Textile Commissioner import entitlement
certificate for the full F.O.B. value of the goods exported as provided in the scheme. The Scheme was
not a statutory Scheme having the force of law but it provided that an export of woollen goods would
be entitled to import raw-material of the total amount equal to 100% of the F.O.B. value of his
exports. The respondents contended that, relying on the promise contained in the Scheme, they had
exported woollen goods to Afghanistan and were,. therefore, entitled to enforce the promise against
the Government and to obtain import entitlement certificate for the full F.O.B. value of the goods
exported on the principle of promissory estoppel. This contention was sought to be answered on
behalf of the Government by pleading the doctrine of executive necessity and the argument of the
Government based on this doctrine was that it is not competent for the Government to fetter its
future executive action which must necessarily be determined by the needs of the community when
the question arises and no promise or undertaking can be held to be binding on the Government so
as to hamper its freedom of executive action. Certain observations of Rowlatt, J., in
Rederiektiabolaget Amphitrite v. The King (supra) were sought to be pressed into service on behalf
of the Government in support of this argument. We have already referred to these observations
earlier and we need not reproduce them over again. These observation undoubtedly supported the
contention of the Government but it was pointed out by this Court that these observations were
disapproved by Denning J., in Robertson v. Minister of Pensions (supra) where the learned Judge
said that "the Crown cannot escape by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity, that is the
doctrine that the Crown cannot bind itself so as to fetter its future executive action.The defence of
executive necessity is of limited scope. It only avails the Crown where there is an implied term to
that effect or that is the true meaning of the contract" and this statement of Denning, J., was to be
preferred as laying down the correct law of the subject. Shah, J., speaking on behalf of the Court,
observed at p. 376:

"We are unable to accede to the contention that the executive necessity releases the
Government from honouring its solemn promises relying on which citizens have
acted to their detriment. Under our constitutional set-up no person may be deprived
of his right or liberty except in due course of and by authority of law; of a member of
the Executive seeks to deprive a citizen of his right or liberty otherwise than in
exercise of power derived from the law-common or statute-the Courts will be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 34M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

competent to and indeed would be bound to, protect the rights of the aggrieved
citizen."

The defence of executive necessity was thus clearly negatived by this Court and it was pointed out
that it did not release the Government from its obligation to honour the promise made by it, if the
citizen, acting in reliance on the promise, had altered his position. The doctrine of promissory
estoppel was in such a case applicable against the Government and it could not be deteated by
invoking the defence of executive necessity.

It was also contended on behalf of the Government that if the Government were held bound by every
representation made by it regarding its intention, when the exporters have acted in the manner they
were invited to act, the result would be that the Government would be bound by a contractual
obligation even though no formal contract in the manner required by Article 299 was executed. But
this contention was negatived and it was pointed out by this Court that the respondents "are not
seeking to enforce any contractual right: they are seeking to enforce compliance with the obligation
which is laid upon the Textile Commissioner by the terms of the Scheme, and we are of the view that
even if the Scheme is executive in character, the respondents who were aggrieved because of the
failure to carry out the terms of the Scheme were entitled to seek resort to the Court and claim that
the obligation imposed upon the Textile Commissioner by the Scheme be ordered to be carried out".
It was thus laid down that a party who has, acting in reliance on a promise made by the
Government, altered his position, is entitled to enforce the promise against the Government, even
though the promise is not in the form of a formal contract as required by Article 299 and that Article
does not militate against the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the
Government.

This Court finally, after referring to the decision in the Ganges Manufacturing Co. v. Surujmull
(supra). The Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay v. The Secretary of State for India (supra)
and Collector of Bombay v. Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay & Ors. (supra), summed up
the position as follows:

"Under our jurisprudence the Government is not exempt from liability to carry out
the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some
undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the
promise solemnly made by it, nor claim to be the Judge of its own obligation to the
citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances in which the obligation has
arisen."

The law may, therefore, now be taken to be settled as a result of this decision that where the
Government makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the promises and,
in fact, the promisee, acting in reliance on it, alters his position, the Government would be held
bound by the promise and the promise would be enforceable against the Government at the instance
of the promises, notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is
not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by Article 299 of the Constitution. It is
elementary that in a Republic governed by the rule of law, no one, howsoever high or low, is above

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 35M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

the law. Every one is subject to the law as fully and completely as any other and the Government is
no exception. It is indeed the pride of constitutional democracy and rule of law that the Government
stands on the same footing as a private individual so far as the obligation of the law is concerned:
the former is equally bound as the latter. It is indeed difficult to see on what principle can a
Government, committed to the rule of law, claim immunity from the doctrine of promissory
estoppel. Can the Government say that it is under no obligation to act in a manner that is fair and
just or that it is not bound by considerations of "honesty and good faith"? Why should the
Government not be held to a high "standard of rectangular rectitude while dealing with its citizens"?
There was a time when the doctrine of executive necessity was regarded as sufficient justification for
the Government to repudiate even its contractual obligations, but let it be said to the eternal glory of
this Court, this doctrine was emphatically negatived in the Indo-Afghan Agencies case and the
supremacy of the rule of law was established. It was laid down by this Court that the Government
cannot claim to be immune from the applicability of the rule of promissory estoppel and repudiate a
promise made by it on the ground that such promise may fetter its future executive action. If the
Government does not want its freedom of executive action to be hampered or restricted, the
Government need not make a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the
promisee and the promisee would alter his position relying upon it. But if the Government makes
such a promise and the promises acts in reliance upon it and alters his position, there is no reason
why the Government should not be compelled to make good such promise like any other private
individual. The law cannot acquire legitimacy and gain social acceptance unless it accords with the
moral values of the society and the constant endeavor of the Courts and the legislatures must,
therefore, be to close the gap between law and morality and bring about as near an approximation
between the two as possible. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is a significant judicial
contribution in that direction.

But it is necessary to point out that since the doctrine of promissory estoppel is an equitable
doctrine, it must yield when the equity so requires. If it can be shown by the Government that
having regard to the facts as they have transpired, it would be inequitable to hold the Government to
the promise made by it, the Court would not raise an equity in favour of the promisee and enforce
the promise against the Government. The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in
such a case because, on the facts, equity would not require that the Government should be held
bound by the promise made by it. When the Government is able to show that in view of the facts as
have transpired, public interest would be prejudiced if the Government were required to carry out
the promise, the Court would have to balance the public interest in the Government carrying out a
promise made to a citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and after this position and the
public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the Government and
determine which way the equity lies. It would not be enough for the Government just to say that
public interest requires that the Government should not be compelled to carry out the promise or
that the public interest would suffer if the Government were required to honour it. The Government
cannot, as Shah, J., pointed out in the Indo-Afghan Agencies case, claim to be exempt from the
liability to carry out the promise "on some indefinite and undisclosed ground of necessity or
expediency", nor can the Government claim to be the sole judge of its liability and repudiate it "on
an ex-parte appraisement of the circumstances". If the Government wants to resist the liability, it
will have to disclose to the Court what are the facts and circumstances on account of which the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 36M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

Government claims to be exempt from the liability and it would be for the Court to decide whether
these facts and circumstances are such as to render it inequitable to enforce the liability against the
Government. Mere claim of change of policy would not be sufficient to exonerate the Government
from the liability: the Government would have to show what precisely is the changed policy and also
its reason and justification so that the Court can judge for itself which way the public interest lies
and what the equity of the case demands. It is only if the Court is satisfied, on proper and adequate
material placed by the Government, the over-riding public interest requires that the Government
should not be held bound by the promise but should be free to act unfettered by it, that the Court
would refuse to enforce the promise against the Government. The Court would not act on the mere
ipse dixit of the Government, for it is the Court which has to decide and not the Government
whether the Government should be held exempt from liability. This is the essence of the rule of law.
The burden would be upon the Government to show that the public interest in the Government
acting otherwise than in accordance with the promise is so overwhelming that it would be
inequitable to hold the Government bound by the promise and the Court would insist on a highly
rigorous standard of proof in the discharge of this burden. But even where there is no such
over-riding public interest, it may still be competent to the Government to resile from the promise
"on giving reasonable notice which need not be a formal notice, giving the promisee a reasonable
opportunity of resuming his position" provided of course it is possible for the promisee to restore
status quo ante. If however, the promisee cannot resume his position, the promise would become
final and irrevocable. Vide Emmanuel Ayodeji Ajayi v. Briscoe.(1) The doctrine of promissory
estoppel was also held applicable against a public authority like a Municipal Council in Century
Spinning & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. & Anr. v. The Ulhasuagar Municipal Council & Anr.(2) The
question which arose in this case was whether the Ulhas Nagar Municipal Council could be
compelled to carry out a promise made by its predecessor municipality that the factories in the
industrial area within its jurisdiction would be exempt from payment of octroi for seven years from
the date of the levy. The appellant company, in the belief induced by the assurance and undertaking
given by the predecessor municipality that its factory would be exempt from octroi for a period of
seven years, expanded its activities, but when the municipal council came into being and took over
the administration of the former municipality, it sight to levy octroi duty on appellant-company. The
appellant company thereupon filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High
Court of Bombay to restrain the municipal council from enforcing the levy of octroi duty in breach of
the promise made by the predecessor municipality. The High Court dismissed the petition in limine
but, on appeal, this Court took the view that this was a case which required consideration and
should have been admitted by the High Court. Shah, J., speaking on behalf of the Court, pointed out
"Public bodies are as much bound as private individuals to carry out representations of facts and
promises made by them, relying on which other persons have altered their position to their
prejudice. The obligation arising against an individual out of his representation amounting to a
promise may be enforced ex contracted by a person who acts upon the promise: when the law
requires that a contract enforceable at law against a public body shall be in certain from or be
executed in the manner prescribed by statute, the obligation may be if the contract be not in that
form be enforced against it in appropriate cases in equity." The learned Judge then referred to the
decision in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and observed that in that case it was laid down by this
Court that "the Government is not exempt from the equity arising out of the acts done by citizens to
their prejudice relying upon the representations as to its future conduct made by the Government".

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 37M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

It was also pointed out by the learned Judge that in the Indo-Afghan Agencies case this Court
approved of the observations made by Denning, J. in Robertson v. Minister of Pensions (supra)
rejecting the doctrine of executive necessity and held them to be applicable in India. The learned
Judge concluded by saying in words pregnant in the hope and meaning for democracy:

"If our nascent democracy is to thrive different standards of conduct for the people
and the public bodies cannot ordinarily be permitted. A public body is, in our
judgment, not exempt from liability to carry out its obligation arising out of
representations made by it relying upon which a citizen has altered his position to his
prejudice.”

This Court refused to make a distinction between a private individual and a public body so far as the
doctrine of promissory estoppel is concerned.

We then come to another important decision of this Court in Turner Morrison & Co. Ltd. v.
Hungerford Investment Trust Ltd. (1) where the doctrine of promissory estoppel was once again
affirmed by this Court. Hegde, J, speaking on behalf of the Court, pointed out: "Estoppel" is a rule of
equity. "That rule has gained new dimensions in recent years. A new class of estoppel i.e. promissory
estoppel has come to be recognised by the courts in this Country as well as in England. The full
implication of promissory estoppel’ is yet to be spelled out." The learned Judge, after referring to
the decisions in High Trees case, Robertson v. Minister of Pensions (supra) and the Indo-Afghan
Agencies case, pointed out that "the rule laid down in these decisions undoubtedly advanced the
cause of justice and hence we have no hesitation in accepting it.

We must also refer to the decision of this Court in M. Ramanatha Pillai v. The State of Kerala &
Anr.(1) because that was a decision strongly relied upon on behalf of the State for negativing the
applicability of the doctrine of estoppel against the Government. This was a case where the appellant
was appointed to a temporary post and on the post being abolished, the service of the appellant was
terminated. The appellant challenged the validity of termination of service, inter alia, on the ground
that the Government was precluded from abolishing the post and terminating the service on the
principle of promissory estoppel. This ground based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel was
negatived and it was pointed out by the Court that the appellant knew that the post was temporary,
suggesting clearly that the appellant could not possibly be led into the belief that the post would not
be abolished. If the post was temporary to the knowledge of the appellant, it is obvious that the
appellant knew that the post would be liable to be abolished at any time and if that be so, there could
be no factual basis for invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel for the purpose of precluding
the Government from abolishing the post. This view taken by the Court was sufficient to dispose of
the contention based on promissory estoppel and it was not necessary to say anything more about it,
but the Court proceeded to cite a passage from American Jurisprudence, Vol. 28 (2d) at 783,
paragraph 123 and observed that the High Court rightly held "that the courts exclude the operation
of the doctrine of estoppel, when it is found that the authority against whom estoppel is pleaded has
owed a duty to the public against whom the estoppel cannot fairly operate." It was this observation
which was heavily relied upon on behalf of the State but we fail to see how it can assist the
contention of the State. In the first place, this observation was clearly obiter, since, as pointed out by

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 38M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

us, there was on the facts of the present case no scope for the applicability of the doctrine of
promissory estoppel. Secondly, this observation was based upon a quotation from the passage in
paragraph 123 at page 783 of Volume 28 of American Jurisprudence (2 d), but unfortunately this
quotation was incomplete and it overlooked, perhaps inadvertently, the following two important
sentences at the commencement of the paragraph which clearly show that even in the United States
the doctrine of promissory estoppel is applied against the State "when justified by the facts":

"There is considerable dispute as to the application of estoppel with respect to the
State. While it is said that equitable estoppel will be invoked against the State when
justified by the facts, clearly the doctrine of estoppel should not be lightly invoked
against the State" (emphasis supplied).

Even the truncated passage quoted by the Court recognised in the last sentence that though, as a
general rule, the doctrine of promissory estoppel would not be applied against the State in its
governmental, public or sovereign capacity, the Court would unhesitatingly allow the doctrine to be
invoked in cases where it is necessary in order "to prevent fraud or manifest injustice". This passage
leaves no doubt that the doctrine of promissory estoppel may be applied against the State even in its
governmental, public or sovereign capacity where it is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest
injustice. It is difficult to imagine that the Court citing this passage with approval could have
possibly intended to lay down that in no case can the doctrine of promissory estoppel be invoked
against the Government. Lastly, a proper reading of the observation of the Court clearly shows that
what the Court intended to say was that where the Government owes a duty to the public to act
differently, promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to prevent the Government from doing so. This
proposition is unexceptionable, because where the Government owes a duty to the public to act ina
particular manner, and here obviously duty means a course of conduct enjoined by law, the doctrine
of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked for preventing the Government from acting in discharge
of its duty under the law. The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be applied in teeth of an
obligation or liability imposed by law.

We may then refer to the decision of this Court in Assistant Custodian v. Brij Kishore Agarwala &
Ors.(1) It is not necessary to reproduce the facts of this case, because the only purpose for which this
decision was relied upon on behalf of the State was to show that the view taken by the House of
Lords in Howell v. Falmouth Boat Construction Co. Ltd. (Supra) was preferred by this Court to that
taken by Lord Denning in Robertson v. Minister of Pension (supra). It is true that in this case the
Court expressed the opinion "that the view taken by the House of Lords is the correct one and not
the one taken by Lord Denning" but we fail to see how that can possibly help the argument of the
State. The House of Lords did not in Howell's case negative the applicability of the doctrine of
promissory estoppel against the Government. What it laid down was merely this, namely, that no
representation or promise made by an officer can preclude the Government from enforcing a
statutory prohibition. The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be availed to permit or condone a
breach of the law. The ratio of the decision was succinctly put by Lord Normand when he said"neither a minister nor any subordinate officer of the Crown can by any conduct or representation
bar the Crown from enforcing a statutory prohibition or entitle the subject to maintain that there
has been no breach of it". It may also be noted that promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 39M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

compel the Government or even a private party to do an act prohibited by law. There can also be no
promissory estoppel against the exercise of legislative power. The Legislature can never be
precluded from exercising its legislative function by resort to the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
Vide State of Kerala v. Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing Co. Ltd.(1) The next decision to which we
must refer is that in Excise Commissioner, U.P. Allahabad v. Ram Kumar.(2) This was also a
decision on which strong reliance was placed on behalf of the State. It is true that, in this case, the
Court observed that "it is now well settled by a catena of decisions that there can be no question of
estoppel against the Government in the exercise of its legislative, sovereign or executive powers,"
but for reasons which we shall presently state, we do not think this observation can persuade us to
take a different view of the law than that enunciated in the Indo-Afghan Agencies' case. In the first
place, it is clear that in this case there was factually no foundation for invoking the doctrine of
promissory estoppel. When the State auctioned the licence for retail sale of country liquor and the
respondents being the highest bidders were granted such licence, there was in force a Notification
dated 6th April, 1959, issued under section 4 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948, exempting sale of
country liquor from payment of sales tax. No announcement was made at the time of the auction
whether the exemption from sales tax under this Notification dated 6th April, 1959 was or was not
likely to be withdrawn. However, on the day following the commencement of the licence granted to
the respondents, the Government of U.P. issued a Notification dated 2nd April, 1969 superseding
the earlier Notification dated 6th April, 1959 and imposing sales tax on the turnover in respect of
country spirit with immediate effect. This notification dated 2nd April, 1969 was challenged by the
respondents by filing a writ petition and amongst the several grounds of challenge taken in the writ
petition, one was that "since the State Government did not announce at the time of the aforesaid
auction that the Notification---------- dated 6th April, 1959 was likely to be withdrawn and the sales
of country liquor were likely to be subjected to the levy of sales tax during the excise year and in
reply to the query made by them at the time of the auction they were told by the authorities that
there was no sales tax on the sale of country liquor, the appellants herein were estopped from
making the demand in respect of sales tax and recovering the same from them". It was in the context
of this ground of challenge that the Court came to make the observation relied upon on behalf of the
State. Now, it is clear that, even taking the case of the respondents at its highest, there was no
representation or promise made by the Government that they would continue the exemp
tion from sales tax granted under the Notification dated 6th April, 1959 and would not withdraw it,
and the Notification dated 2nd April, 1969 could not, therefore, be assailed as being in breach of any
such representation or promise. There was accordingly, no factual basis for making good the plea of
promissory estoppel and the observation made by the court in regard to the applicability of the
doctrine of promissory estoppel against the Government was clear obiter. That perhaps was the
reason why the Court did not consider it necessary to refer to the earlier decisions in Century
Spinning & manufacturing Co.'s case and Turner Morrison's case and particularly the decision in the
Indo-Afghan Agencies case where the court in so many terms applied the doctrine of promissory
estoppel against the Government in the exercise of its executive power. It is not possible to believe
that the Court was oblivious of these earlier decisions, particularly when one of these decisions in
the Indo-Afghan Agencies case was an epoch making decision which marked a definite advance in
the field of administrative law. Moreover, it may be noted that though, standing by itself, the
observation made by the Court that "there can be no question of estoppel against the Government in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 40M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

exercise of its legislative, sovereign or executive powers" may appear to be wide and unqualified, it is
not so, if read in its proper context. This observation was made on the basis of certain decisions
which the Court proceeded to discuss in the succeeding paragraphs of the judgment. The Court first
relied on the statement of the law contained in paragraph 123 at page 783, Volume 28 of the
American Jurisprudence (2d), but it omitted to mention the two important sentences at the
commencement of the paragraph and the words "unless its application is necessary to prevent fraud
or manifest injustice" at the end, which clearly show that even according to the American
Jurisprudence, the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not wholly inapplicable against the
Government in its governmental, public or sovereign capacity, but it can be invoked against the
Government "when justified by the facts" as for example where it is necessary to prevent fraud or
injustice. In fact, as already pointed out above, there are numerous cases in the United States where
the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been applied against the Government in the exercise of its
governmental, public or executive powers. The Court then relied upon the decision in the Gwalior
Rayon Silk Manufacturing Co.'s case, but that decision was confined to a case where legislation was
sought to be precluded by relying on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and it was held, and in our
opinion rightly, that there can be no promissory estoppel against the legislature in the exercise of its
legislative function. That decision does not negative the applicability of the doctrine of promissory
estoppel against the Government in the exercise of its governmental, public or executive powers.
The decision in Howell's case was, thereafter, relied upon by the Court, but that decision merely says
that the Government cannot be debarred by promissory estoppel from enforcing a statutory
prohibition. It does not countenance an absolute proposition that promissory estoppel can never be
invoked against the government. The Court also cited a passage from the judgment of the High
Court of Jammu & Kashmir in Malhotra & Sons & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.,(1) but this passage
itself makes it clear that the courts will bind the Government by its promise where it is necessary to
do so in order to prevent manifest injustice or fraud. The last decision on which the Court relied was
Federal Crop Insurance Corporation v. Morrill (supra) but this decision also does not support the
view contended for on behalf of the State. We have already referred to this decision earlier and
pointed out that the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation in this case was held not liable on the
policy of insurance, because the regulations made by the Corporation prohibited insurance of
reseeded wheat. The principle of this decision was that promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to
compel the Government or a public authority to carry out a representation or promise which is
contrary to law. It will thus be seen from the decisions relied upon in the judgment that the Court
could not possibly have intended to lay down an absolute proposition that there can be no
promissory estoppel against the Government in the exercise of its governmental, public or executive
powers. That would have been in complete contradiction of the decisions of this Court in the IndoAfghan Agencies Case, Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co.'s case and Turner Morrison's case
and we find it difficult to believe that the Court could have ever intended to lay down any such
proposition without expressly referring to these earlier decisions and over-ruling them. We are,
therefore, of the opinion that the observation made by the Court in Ram Kumar's case does not
militate against the view we are taking on the basis of the decisions in the Indo- Afghan Agencies'
case, Century Spinning & Manufacturing Co.'s case and Turner Morrison's case in regard to the
applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the Government.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 4M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

We may then refer to the decision of this Court in Bihar Eastern Gangetic Fishermen Co-operative
Society Ltd. v. Sipahi Singh & Ors.(2) It was held in this case in paragraph 12 of the judgment that
the respondent could not invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel because he was unable to show
that, relying on the representation of the Govern
ment, he had altered his position by investing moneys and the allegations made by him in that
behalf were "much too vague and general" and there was accordingly no factual foundation for
establishing the plea of promissory estoppel. On this view, it was unnecessary to consider whether
the doctrine of promissory estoppel was applicable against the Government, but the Court
proceeded to reiterate, without any further discussion, the observation in Ram Kumar's case that
"there cannot be any estoppel against the Government in the exercise of its sovereign, legislative and
executive functions". This was clearly in the nature of obiter and it cannot prevail as against the
statement of law laid down in the Indo-Afghan Agencies case. Moreover, it is clear from paragraph
14 of the judgment that this Court did not intend to lay down any proposition of law different from
that enunciated in the Indo-Afghan Agencies case because it approved of the decision in the
Indo-Afghan Agencies case and distinguished it on the ground that in that case there was not
enforcement of contractual right but the claim was founded upon equity arising from the Scheme,
while in the case before the Court, a contractual right was sought to be enforced. There is, therefore,
nothing in this decision which should compel us to take a view different from the one we are
otherwise inclined to accept.

We may point out that in the latest decision on the subject in Radha Krishna Agarwal v. State of
Bihar & Ors.(1) this Court approved of the decisions in the Indo-Afghan Agencies case and Century
Spinning and Manufacturing Co's case and pointed out that these were cases where it could be held
that public bodies or the State are as much bound as private individuals are to carry out obligations
incurred by them because parties seeking to bind the authorities have altered their position to their
disadvantage or have acted to their detriment on the strength of the representations made by these
authorities". It would, therefore, be seen that there is no authoritative decision of the Supreme Court
which has departed from the law laid down in the celebrated decisions in the Indo-Afghan Agencies
case and the Century Spinning & Manufacturing Co's case. The law laid down in these decisions as
elaborated and expounded by us continues to hold the field.

We may now turn to examine the facts in the light of the law discussed by us. It is clear from the
letter of the 4th respondent dated 23rd January, 1969 that a categorical representation was made by
the 4th respondent on behalf of the Government that the proposed vanaspati factory of the appellant
would be entitled to exemption from sales tax in respect of sales of vanaspati effected in Uttar
Pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production. This
representation was made by way of clarification in view of the suggestion in the appellant's letter
dated 22nd January, 1969 that the financial institutions were not prepared to regard the earlier
letter of the 4th respondent dated 22nd December, 1968 as a definite commitment on the part of the
Government to grant exemption from sales tax. Now the letter dated 23rd January, 1969 clearly
shows that the 4th respondent made this representation in his capacity as the Chief Secretary of the
Government, and it was, therefore, a representation on behalf of the government. It was faintly
contended before us on behalf of the State that this representation was not binding on the

Government, but we cannot countenance this argument, because, in the first place, the averment in
the writ petition that the 4th respondent made this representation on behalf of the government was
not denied by the State in the affidavit in reply filed on its behalf, and secondly, it is difficult to
accept the contention that the 4th respondent, who was at the material time the Chief Secretary to
the government and also advisor to the Governor who was discharging the functions of the
Government. We must, therefore, proceed on the basis that this representation made by the 4th
respondent was a representation within the scope of his authority and was binding on the
Government. Now, there can be no doubt that this representation was made by the Government
knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the appellant, because the appellant had made it
clear that it was only on account of the exemption from sales tax promised by the Government that
the appellant had decided to set up the factory for manufacture of vanaspati at Kanpur. The
appellant, in fact, relying on this representation of the Government, borrowed moneys from various
financial institutions, purchased plant and machinery from M/s. De Smith (India) Pvt. Ltd., Bombay
and set up a vanaspati factory at Kanpur. The facts necessary for invoking the doctrine of
promissory estoppel were, therefore, clearly present and the Government was bound to carry out the
representation and exempt the appellant from sales tax in respect out the representation and
exempt the appellant from sales tax in respect of sales of vanaspati effected by it in Uttar Pradesh for
a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production.

The State, however, contended that the doctrine of promissory estoppel had no application in the
present case because the appellant did not suffer any detriment by acting on the representation
made by the Government : the vanaspati factory set up by the appellant was quite a profitable
concern and there was no prejudice caused to the appellant. This contention of the State is clearly
unsustainable and must be rejected. We do not think it is necessary, in order to attract the
applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel, that the promisee acting in reliance of the
promise, should suffer any detriment. What is necessary is only that the promisees should have
altered his position in reliance on the promise. This position was implied accepted by Denning, J., in
the High Trees' case when the learned Judge pointed out that the promise must be one "which was
intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise,
was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact acted an"
(emphasis supplied). If a promise is "acted on", "such action, in law as in physics, must necessarily
result in an alteration of position." This was again reiterated by Lord Denning in W.J. Alan & Co.
Ltd. x. El. Nasr Export and Import Co.(1) where the learned Law Lord made it clear that alteration of
position "only means that he (the promise) must have been led to act differently from what he would
otherwise have done. And if you study the cases in which the doctrine has been applied, you will see
that all that is required is that the one should have acted on the belief induced by the other party."
Viscount Simonds also observed in Tool Metal Manufacturing Co. Ltd v. Tungsten Electric Co. Ltd.
(2) that "the gist of the equity lies in the fact that one party has by his conduct led the other to alter
his position". The judgment of Lord Tucker in the same case would be found to depend likewise on a
fundamental finding of alteration of position, and the same may be said of that of Lord Coheb. Then
again in Emmanuel Avodeji v. Briscoe (supra) Lord Hodson said: "This equity,is however, subject to
the qualification (1) that the other party has altered his position". The same requirement was also
emphasised by Lord Diplock in Kaminins Ballrooms Ltd. v. Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd. (3)
What is necessary, therefore, is no more than that there should be alteration of position on the part

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 43M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

of the promisee. The alteration of position need not involve any detriment to the promises. If
detriment were a necessary element, there would be no need for the doctrine of promissory estoppel
because in that event, in quite a few cases, the detriment would form the consideration and the
promise could be binding as a contract. There is in fact not a single case in England where detriment
is insisted upon as a necessary ingredient of promissory estoppel. In fact, in W. J. Alan & Co. Ltd. v.
E] Nasar Export and Import Co. (supra), Lord Denning expressly rejected detriment as an essential
ingredient of promissory estoppel, saying:

"A seller may accept a less sum for his goods than the contracted price, thus inducing
(his buyer) to believe that he will not enforce payment of the balance; see Central
London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd. and D. & C. Builders Ltd. v.
Rees [1956] 3 All E.R. 837]. In none of these cases does the party who acts on the
belief suffer any detriment. It is not a detriment, but a benefit to him to have an
extension of time or to pay less, or as the case may be. Nevertheless, he has
conducted his affairs on the basis that he has had that benefit and it would not be
equitable now to deprive him of it."

We do not think that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is necessary for the
promise to show that he suffered detriment as a result of acting in reliance on the promise. But we
may make it clear that if by detriment we mean injustice to the promisee which could result if the
promisor were to recede from his promise then detriment would certainly come in as a necessary
ingredient. The detriment in such a case is not some prejudice suffered by the promisee by acting on
the promise, but the prejudice which would be caused to the promisee, if the promisor were allowed
to go back on the promise. The classic exposition of detriment in this sense is to be found in the
following passage from the judgment of Dixon, J in the Australian case of Grundt v. The Great
Boulder Pty. Gold Mines Ltd. (1):

"-It is often said simply that the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced
to act to his detriment. Although substantially such a statement is correct and leads
to no misunderstanding, it does not bring out clearly the basal purpose of the
doctrine. That purpose is to avoid or prevent a detriment to the party asserting the
estoppel by compelling the opposite party to adhere to the assumption upon which
the former acted or abstained from acting. This means that the real detriment or
harm from which the law seeks to give protection is that which would flow from the
change of position if the assumption were deserted that led to it. So long as the
assumption is adhered to, the party who altered his situation upon the faith of it
cannot complain. His complaint is that when afterwards the other party makes a
different state of affairs the basis of an assertion of right against him then, if it is
allowed, his own original change of position will operate as a detriment. His action or
inaction must be such that, if the assumption upon which he proceeded were shown
to be wrong, and an inconsistent state of affairs were accepted as the foundation of
the rights and duties of himself and the opposite party, the consequence would be to
make his original act or failure to act or source of prejudice."

If this is the kind of detriment contemplated, it would necessarily be present in every case of
promissory estoppel because it is on account of such detriment which the promisee would suffer if
the promisor were to act differently from his promise, that the Court would consider it inequitable to
allow the promisor to go back upon his promise. It would, therefore, be correct to say that in order
to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is enough to show that the promisee has acting in
reliance of the promise, altered his position and it is not necessary for him to further show that he
has acted to his detriment. Here, the appellant clearly altered its position by borrowing moneys from
various financial institutions, purchasing plant and machinery from M/s. De Smet (India) Pvt. Ltd.,
Bombay and setting up a vanaspati plant, in the belief induced by the representation of the
Government that sales tax exemption would be granted for a period of three years from the date of
commencement of the production. The Government was, therefore bound on the principle of
promissory estoppel to make good the representation made by it. Of course, it may be pointed out
that if the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 did not contain a provision enabling the Government to grant
exemption, it would not be possible to enforce the representation against the Government because
the Government cannot be compelled to act contrary to the statute, but since section 4 of the
U.P.Sales Tax Act, 1948 confers power on the Government to grant exemption from sales tax, the
Government can legitimately be held bound by its promise to exempt the appellant from payment of
sales tax. It is true that taxation is a sovereign or governmental function, but, for reasons which we
have already discussed, no distinction can be made between the exercise of a sovereign or
governmental function and a trading or business activity of the Government so far as the doctrine of
promissory estoppel is concerned. Whatever be the nature of the function which the Government is
discharging, the Government is subject to the rule of promissory estoppel and if the essential
ingredients of this rule are satisfied, the Government can be compelled to carry out the promise
made by it. We are, therefore, of the view that in the present case the Government was bound to
exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax in respect of sales of vanaspati effected by it in the
State of Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production
and was not entitled to recover such sales tax from the appellant.

Now, for the assessment year 1970-71, that is, 2nd July, 1970 to 31st March, 1971, the appellant
collected from its customers sales tax amounting to Rs. 6,81,178.95 calculated at the rate of 3 1/2%
on the sale price. But when the assessment was made by the Sales Tax Authorities, sales tax was
levied on the appellant at the rate of 7% and the appellant was required to pay up a further sum of
Rs. 6,80,969.42. The appellant had prayed for an interim order in the present appeal staying further
proceedings, but this Court, by an order dated 3rd April, 1974, granted interim stay only on the
appellant paying up the amount of sales tax due for the assessment year 1970-71 before 31st July,
1974 and so far as the assessment years 1971-72, 1972-73 and 1973-74 were concerned, the Court
directed that the assessments for those years may proceed, but only the final order shall not be
passed. The result was that the appellant had to pay up the further sum of Rs. 6,80,949.42 for the
assessment year 1970-71. The appellant collected from the customers for the assessment year
1971-72 an aggregate sum of Rs. 9,91,206.17 by way of sales tax at the rate of 3 1/2% for the period
ist April, 1971 to 1st July, 1971, 4% for the period 2nd July, 1971 to 24th January, 1972 and 7% for
the period 25th January, 1972 to 31st March, 1972 and deposited this amount in the Treasury.
Similarly, for the assessment year 1972-73, the appellant collected from its customers an aggregate
sum of Rs. 19,36,597.23 as and by way of sales tax at the rate of 7% of the sale price and this amount

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/871220/ 45M/S Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills ... vs State Of Uttar Pradesh And Ors on 12 December, 1978

was deposited by the appellant in the Treasury, and so also for the first quarter of the assessment
year 1973-74 upto the end of which the exemption from sales tax was to continue, the appellant
collected and paid an aggregate sum of Rs. 4,84,884.05 at the rate of 7% of the sale price. It appears
that surcharge amounting to Rs. 2,83,008.09 for the period of the exemption was also paid by the
appellant into the Treasury. The assessments for the assessment years 1971-72, 1972-73 and 1973-74
were, however, not completed in view of the stay order granted by this Court. Now, obviously since
the Government is bound to exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax for a period of three
years from 2nd July, 1970, being the date of commencement of the production, the appellant would
not be liable to pay any sales tax to the State in respect of sales of vanaspati effected during that
period and hence the State would have to refund to the appellant the amount of sales tax paid for the
period 2nd July, 1970 to 31st March, 1971, subject to any claim which the State may have to retain
any part of such amount under any provision of law. If the State has any such claim, it must be
intimated to the appellant within one month from today and it must be adjudicated upon within a
further period of one month after giving proper opportunity to be heard to the appellant. If no such
claim is made, or, if made, not adjudicated upon within the time specified, the State will refund the
amount of sales tax to the appellant with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from the date
when such refund becomes due and if such claim is made and adjudicated upon within the specified
time and it is found that a part of this amount is liable to be retained by the State under some
provision of law, the State will refund the balance to the appellant with interest at the like rate. So
far as the assessment years 1971-72, 1972- 73 and 1973-74 are concerned, the Sales Tax Authorities
will proceed to complete the Assessments for those assessment years in the light of the law laid
down in this judgment and the amounts of sales tax deposited by the appellant will be refunded to
the appellant to the extent to which they are not found due and payable as a result of the
assessments, subject to any claim which the State may have to retain those amounts under any
provision of law.

We accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and issue a writ, order or
direction to the above effect against the respondents. The State will pay the costs of the appellant

throughout.

S.R. Appeal allowed.

JUDGMENT
M.R.SHAH, J.
Leave granted in all these Special Leave Petitions.

1. As common question of law and facts arise in this group of appeals arising out of the impugned
judgment and order dated 15.09.2016 passed by the High Court of Bombay, Bench at Nagpur passed
in Writ Petition No.2695 of 2015, all these appeals are being disposed of by this common judgment
and order. For the sake of convenience, Civil Appeal arising out of the SLP© No.32089 of 2016 is
treated as lead matter and the facts in the said appeal are narrated.

2. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 15.09.2016
passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur
passed in W.P.No.2695 of 2015 by which the Division Bench has allowed the said Writ Petition
preferred by the respondents Nos.1 to 18 hereinLoriginal petitioners Nos.1 to 18 some of the
occupants/tenants of the building in question and by which the Division Bench has set aside the
notice dated 24.04.2015 issued by the Nagpur Improvement Trust, the original
respondentsLNagpur Improvement Trust and others have preferred the present appeals.

 

3. The facts leading to the present appeals in nutshell are as under.

4. That the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act 1936 (hereinafter referred to as the NIT Act) was
enacted on 25.12.1936. That the Nagpur Improvement Trust (hereinafter referred to as the NIT)
vide Board Resolution dated 29.10.1960 framed an improvement Scheme known as Abhyankar
Road Widening and Buty Mahal Street Scheme (hereinafter referred to as the Scheme) in respect of
8.7 acres of land bearing Khasra No.320 and 315 (part) Mouza Sitabuldi, belonging to the Buty
Family. That the same Scheme came to be framed under Section 31 of NIT Act for creating new or
improving the existing means of communications and facilities for traffic. That, inter alia, a new 15
metres wide road was to be constructed to join Mahatma Gandhi Road to Abhyankar Road. That the
internal road of 15 metres provided in the said Scheme is the subject matter of issue in the present
matters. That, the said Scheme came to be published on 29.10.1961 as per Section 39 of the NIT Act.
That, the NIT sought approval of the State Government of the above Scheme. That the State
Government sanctioned the said Scheme in exercise of powers under Section 44(1) read with Section

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 2Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

45(1)(a) of the NIT Act on 23.09.1964. Accordingly, a Notification to that effect was also issued
under Section 45 of the NIT Act.

4.1 That, thereafter, the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as
the MRTP Act) came into effect on 11.01.1967. At this stage, it is required to be noted that, as per the
MRTP Act, any Development Plan made under the said Act had to take precedence over any Scheme
to the contrary. The same shall be discussed hereinbelow.

4.2 That NIT was appointed as the Planning Authority under the MRTP Act for Nagpur. That, in the
year 1967, the First Final Development Plan for the City of Nagpur under Sections 22 and 31 of the
MRTP Act was prepared and sanctioned. At this stage, it is required to be noted that, in the said
final Development Plan, the above 15 metres road which was provided under the Town Planning
Scheme under the NIT Act was not shown in the Development Plan under the MRTP Act.

4.3 That the NIT, in Board meeting dated 05.06.1981 and 31.12.1981, decided to implement the
Scheme. That, a Special Land Acquisition Officer came to be appointed by the State Government for
acquisition of the land and the proceedings of the land acquisition came to be initiated. 4.4 That a
newspaper article was published on 21.06.1981 stating that the NIT has decided to handover the
Buty Mahal Development Scheme to the land owners for redevelopment. That, in the year 1983, a
Writ Petition being WP.No.2326 of 1983 was filed by the land owners before the Nagpur Bench of
the Bombay High Court challenging the acquisition. Initially, the High Court granted an interim stay
on the acquisition proceedings.

4.5 That, on 07.06.1984, the land owners Shri Yogeshwar Buty and Smt. Madhuribai Buty
approached NIT to allot a reconstituted plot or plots bearing Nos.6, 7 and 8 belonging to them.
However, the said request came to be rejected by the NIT on 17.08.1984.

4.6 That, on 13.03.1995, one Smt. Indirabai Buty (land owner) submitted an application for
permission to develop the land stating inter alia, that; (1) Development of the land would be as per
the Development Plan of the NIT; (2) All the tenants would be accommodated in the proposed
Scheme; (3) The betterment charges would be paid to the NIT. That, the Board of NIT in its meeting
held on 11.03.1996 passed a Resolution wherein it was, inter alia, decided ..(1) A plot was allocated
in the matter of Shri Yadhuraj Sanghani; (2) Smt. Indirabai Buty and others land owners to
accommodate in their proposed Scheme, the tenants in the area of the reconstituted plot and (3) All
the petitions in respect of the subject plot would have to be withdrawn unconditionally. On the basis
of the said Resolution of the NIT dated 11.03.1996, Writ Petition No.2326 of 1983 challenging the
acquisition was withdrawn by the land owners.

4.7 In the meantime, in the year 1989, the First Final Development Plan which was earlier prepared
and sanctioned in the year 1986, came to be revised. Again, the above 15 metres internal road was
not depicted in the revised DP. 4.8 It appears that, in the year 1997, NIT addressed letters to the
Urban Development Department requesting the latter to obtain permission from the Government to
relax Rule 5(2) of the NIT (Land Disposal) Rules, 1983 (hereinafter referred to as the 1983 Rules)
under Rule 26 of the 1983 Rules, to allocate the reconstituted plot in the present Scheme. That the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 3Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

State Government vide order dated 07.10.1997 issued under Rule 26 of the 1983 Rules relaxed Rule
5(2) and allotted the reconstituted plot in Survey Nos.3117, 3119, 3123, 3127, 3120, 3122, 3124 and
3125 in Khasra No.320 Mouza Sitabuldi, subject to certain conditions including inter alia that (i)
The Applicants would accept the compensation of the land fixed by the Land Acquisition Officer and
give possession of the lands to him; (ii) Development of the land would as per the Development Plan
of NIT; (iii) All the tenants are to be accommodated in the Scheme and (iv) That in the interest of
tenants the NIT fixed the plot allotment rate @ 50% of the market value, without prejudice to Rule
7(3) of the 1983 Rules.

4.9 That the NIT passed a Board Resolution on 23.10.1997 to implement the altered Scheme in
terms of G.O. dated 07.10.1997. That the Special Land Acquisition Officer, NIT passed an Award
dated 16.12.1997 in respect of the land admeasuring 5677 sq.ft bearing Khasra No.320 Sitabuldi,
Nagpur. That, pursuant to the Award declared by the Land Acquisition Officer, possession of the
land was taken by the Land Acquisition Officer and handed over to NIT. It appears that, out of
271552.60 sq.ft of the land, only 114079.36 sq.ft was acquired by NIT and the rest of the lands
remained with the land owners.

4.10 That the Final Development Plan in terms of Section 31 of the MRTP came to sanctioned in the
year 2001. 4.11 That pursuant to the G.O. dated 07.10.1997, the process of widening of the
Abhyankar road was initiated and notices were issued for demolition of shops. At that stage, Writ
Petition No.798 of 2002 was filed by some of the Abhyankar Road tenants challenging the
demolition notices issued by the NIT to the tenants in the process of road widening. The said Writ
Petition came to be dismissed by the High Court by judgment and order dated 22.02.2002. The
matter was carried before this Court. Before this Court, a compromise was reached between the
petitioners of W.P.No.798 of 2002 and land owners and NIT. By order dated 08.04.2002, SLP©
No.4846 of 2002 was disposed of in terms of the compromise arrived at between the land owners,
the tenants (only on writ petitioners) original petitioners to W.P.No.725 of 2002), wherein inter alia
the following conditions were specified:

The Landlord shall construct a multiLstoreyed building on the reconstituted plot that
was to be allotted to him by the NIT.

The Tenant and Landlord shall within a period of one week from the filing of the
compromise petition would vacate such area out of the property covered in the
instant proceedings in their possession as is required for widening of the Abhayankar
Road.

The compromise also provided, NIT to allot one single reconstituted plot and redevelopment of suit
property to be carried out in accordance with the Development Plan of Nagpur City and all tenants
to be rehoused post development. 4.12 That thereafter, on the request made by the owners, the
Resolution was passed by the NIT dated 23.10.2003 to allot a single reconstituted plot admeasuring
10602.09 sq.mts as undivided share and the same was offered to the Buty family. That thereafter,
the Government by letter dated 12.11.2003 allotted the reconstituted plot to the owners. From the
letter dated 12.11.2003, it appears that the land for road will be provided as per the Development

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 4Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

Plan and that the beneficiaries will have to make land available for road widening and parking.

4.13 It appears that thereafter the NIT represented to the State Government vide Representations
dated 16.08.2005 and 29.03.2006 purportedly under Section 37(1) of the MRTP Act in order to
increase the width of the Abhyankar Road from 12 metres to 24 metres and for converting the
reconstituted plot from residential to commercial in order to accommodate the tenants running
commercial shops.

4.14 It appears that thereafter on 02.08.2006, the owners entered into a development agreement
with one of the petitioners herein M/s Goel Ganga Infrastructure & Real Estate Pvt. Ltd. For
developing the property bearing Khasra No.320.

4.15 That thereafter the State Government passed an order dated 22.06.2007 under Section 37(1) of
the MRTP Act permitting the change of use in respect of Khasra No.320 and 315 (Part) from
residential to commercial. It appears that the permission was also granted by the State to widen the
Abhyankar Road to 24 metres in place of 12 metres. 4.16 It appears that thereafter the provisional
sanction was granted by NIT on 22.04.2008 to the drawing/building map to the layout plan
submitted by developer for the construction of a commercial complex. It appears that thereafter vide
letter dated 18.08.2009, the NIT issued a letter to the land owners allotting a single reconstituted
plot admeasuring 114079.36 sq.mts to the land owners, subject to the conditions mentioned in the
said letter. That thereafter, on 10.02.2010, a lease deed was executed between the NIT and the land
owners in respect of the reconstituted plot subject to the terms and conditions mentioned in the
allotment letter dated 18.08.2009. It appears that thereafter on 15.05.2012, the NIT sanctioned the
Final Layout Plan in respect of the reconstituted plot as per the D.C.R. of Nagpur City. That the
building plan also came to be sanctioned on 27.06.2012 in accordance with the D.C.R. of Nagpur
City. That, on 10.12.2014, building permit and commencement certificates were issued by the NIT
subject to certain conditions specified therein. That a revised building plan was also sanctioned by
the NIT on 11.12.2014 subject to the conditions mentioned therein.

4.17 That thereafter on 24.04.2015, the NIT issued notices to the tenants asking them to vacate a
portion of their shops so as to enable construction as per the layout plan. 4.18 The aforesaid notices
gave rise to filing of Writ Petition No.2695 of 2015 before the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench.
In the said Writ Petition, the Respondents Nos.1 to 18 herein the original writ petitioners prayed
inter alia for an order quashing the notices issued by the NIT on 24.04.2015. That the said petition
was opposed by the original writ petitioners as well as the NIT. It appears that thereafter the original
writ petitioners filed an application being C.A.No.1615 of 2015 in W.P.No.2695 of 2015 praying for
amendment to the prayers in the writ petition and allow them to challenge the sanctioned plan
dated 27.06.2012 and the revised plan dated 11.12.2014. The said amendment was opposed by the
original land owners and the developers. However, thereafter High Court allowed the said
Amendment application. 4.19 It appears that, during the course of the hearing, the High Court by
order dated 03.09.2015 in W.P.No.2695 of 2015 directed the Chairman, NIT to explore the
possibility of an amicable settlement by calling the representatives of both the tenants and the
developers and land owners and directed to submit a report to the Court. It appears that, pursuant
to the order dated 03.09.2015, the Chairman, NIT called all the parties. That thereafter the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 5Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

Chairman, NIT submitted a report on 15.10.2015 stating that no settlement could be arrived at
between the parties.

4.20 That thereafter, by impugned judgment and order, the High Court has allowed the Writ
Petition and has quashed and set aside the demolition notice dated 28.04.2015 issued by the NIT.
The High Court has also further observed that it will be open for the NIT to issue fresh notices of
demolition to the writ petitioners after the sanctioned layout plan dated 15.05.2012, the building
permit granted on 27.06.2012 revised on 11.12.2014 as well as the construction, if any, carried out
are brought in conformity with the Scheme published under Section 45 of the NIT Act of
23.09.1964. While passing the impugned judgment and order the High Court has observed and held
that the layout plan sanctioned in the building permit granted are contrary to the provisions of the
Scheme published and sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act and that the same suffers from
vice of internal mischief.

4.21 That the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court dated 15.09.2016 in
W.P.No.2595 of 2016 is the subject matter of the present appeals.

5. It appears that, in the meantime and after the impugned judgment and order passed by the High
Court, the original Scheme sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act which provided 15 metres
internal road came to be modified as provided under the NIT Act by deleting 15 metres internal
road. The same came to be published in the Government of Maharashtra Gazette on 24.04.2017.
That the W.P.No.5005 of 2017 was filed by the 18 tenants/shopkeepers before the Nagpur Bench,
Bombay High Court questioning the Resolution passed by the NIT dated 24.04.2017 issued under
Section 46 of the NIT Act deleting 15 metres internal road and another internal road from the
Scheme. That a Transfer Case No.23 of 2018 was filed before this Court praying inter alia for
transfer of W.P.No.5005 of 2017 to this Court. That is how, the Transfer Case No.23 of 2015 is also
listed along with the present group of appeals.

5.1 We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties in the transferred Writ
Petition No.5005 of 2017 also, along with the other appeals arising out of the impugned judgment
and order dated 15.09.2016 passed in W.P.No.2695 of 2015.

6. Mr. V. Giri, Mr. Mukul Rohtagi and Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf
of the respective appellants have vehemently submitted that the impugned judgment and order
passed by the High Court is contrary to the provisions of MRTP Act and also the law laid down by
this Court in the case of Manohar Joshi vs. State of Maharashtra & Anr. 2012 (3) SCC 619.

 

6.1 The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective appellantsLoriginal respondents have
vehemently submitted that while passing the impugned judgment and order the High Court has not
properly appreciated and considered the relevant provisions of MRTP Act. 6.2 The learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the respective appellants have vehemently submitted that though in the
original Scheme framed under the provisions of the NIT, 1936 there was a provision for 15 metres
internal road, thereafter when the MRTP Act came to be enacted and came into force and the
Development Plan framed and sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act did not contain any

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 6Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

internal road as was there in the Scheme published under Section 45 of the NIT Act, in view of the
provisions of the MRTP Act, the Development Plan overrides the DP Scheme and, therefore, there is
no question of providing any internal road. It is submitted that the High Court has not properly
appreciated the abovesaid at all.

6.3 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective
appellants that, as per the law laid down in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra), the DP Plan overrides
the Scheme; and anything contrary to the DP Plan in the Scheme shall have to be varied to bring it
in line with the Development Plan sanctioned under the provisions of MRTP Act. It is submitted
that, therefore, the High Court has materially erred in quashing and setting aside the notices of
demolition which are based upon final layout plan sanctioned on 15.05.2012 and building permit
granted on 27.06.2012, and revised on 11.12.2014, which were as per the provisions of MRTP Act.

6.4 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective appellants
that the High Court has materially erred in misreading and/or misinterpreting the judgment of this
Court in Manohar Joshi (supra) and held that the statutory obligations created upon the NIT under
Section 45 of the NIT Act to execute the Scheme to the extent it is not in variation or modification of
the proposals in the Final Development Plan, continues to subsist and can be enforced. It is
vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the respective appellants that the
aforesaid observations are just contrary to the observations made by this Court in the case of
Manohar Joshi (supra). It is submitted that in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra) this Court has
specifically observed and held that even if such a variation as directed under Section 39 of MRTP
Act does not take place, the land cannot be put to use in any way in contradiction with the provisions
in the DP Plan. 6.5 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
respective appellants that even the aforesaid finding and the observation are contrary to Section 43
of the MRTP Act which provides that once the declaration of intention to prepare a Development
Plan is presented, no development contrary thereto can be permitted. 6.6 It is further submitted by
the learned counsel for the respective appellants that the High Court has not properly appreciated
and considered the fact that, in view of the subsequent development and the widening of the existing
road, there was no necessity for internal road as provided in the Scheme under the NIT Act. It is
submitted that as such in view of the subsequent development and widening of the existing road,
when subsequently the DP under the MRTP Act was prepared, there was no provision for 15 metres
internal road as provided earlier in the Scheme under the NIT Act. 6.7 It is further submitted by the
learned counsel that the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that as such in the
Development Plan prepared under the provisions of MRTP Act, which was first prepared in the year
1976 and in the subsequent DP, there was no provision for the internal road and, despite the same,
the same was not challenged by the original writ petitioners. It is submitted that even initially what
was challenged in the main writ petition was demolition notices. It is submitted that even
subsequently also the DP prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of MRTP Act, which does
not contain any provision for internal road was not under challenge at all. It is submitted that,
therefore, the layout plan came to be sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act and the
building permit was issued under the provisions of MRTP Act, which came to be challenged
subsequently by way of amendment. It is submitted that in view of the relevant provisions of the
MRTP Act, the construction has to be made as per the layout plan and the building permit granted

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 7Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

under the provisions of MRTP ACT. It is submitted, that, therefore, the High Court has materially
erred in quashing and setting aside the final layout plan as well as the building permit solely on the
ground that the same is in contravention of the Scheme published under Section 45 of the NIT Act.

6.8 It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the Appellants that the High Court has not
properly appreciated and considered the stand of the NIT that punctuated lines in the Development
Plan only indicate the boundaries of the Scheme under the control of the NIT and it has no more
significance than this.

6.9 It is further submitted by the learned counsel that the High Court has materially erred in
observing that, in the absence of any provisions contrary to the internal road, shown in the
Development Plan, it cannot be said that the provisions of the internal road vanishes automatically.
It is submitted that the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that as such the
Development Plan which has been prepared in consonance with the provisions of the MRTP Act,
specifically do not provide any internal road, which was earlier provided in the Scheme under the
NIT Act. 6.10 It is further submitted by the learned counsel that even the Government Resolution
dated 07.10.1997 specifically provided and/or permitted to develop the land in question as per the
Development Plan and not as per the Scheme. It is submitted by learned counsel that while issuing
G.O. dated 07.10.1997, it was specifically noted that the 50 ft. (15 metres) wide road through the
land is not provided under the Development Plan. It is submitted that the aforesaid was even
considered and noted by the NIT. It is submitted that despite the above the High Court has observed
that all throughout the NIT desired to implement the Scheme. 6.11 It is further submitted by the
learned counsel that the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that even one consolidated
plot was allotted under the provisions of the MRTP Act and thereafter the layout plan as per the
provisions of the MRTP Act was submitted and got sanctioned and the development permission was
obtained to carry out the construction which was granted as per the DP sanctioned under the
provisions of MRTP Act. It is submitted that the High Court has materially erred in quashing and
setting aside the demolition notices which as such were consequent upon the sanction of the layout
plan and the grant of the permission. It is submitted that the High Court has materially erred in
quashing and setting aside the sanctioned layout plan as well as the development permission
granted under the provisions of the MRTP Act. It is further submitted by the learned counsel that
the High Court has, therefore, materially erred in observing and holding that grant of
permission/sanction of layout plan which was in contravention of the Scheme under the NIT Act
was a mischief in law to provide an unfair advantage to the developers and the owners and it
deprives the facility of frontage to the tenants on the internal road. 6.12 It is further submitted by
the learned counsel that the High Court has materially erred in not appreciating the fact that only 18
tenants filed the writ petition and were aggrieved, against which majority of the tenants accepted the
settlement/compromise before this Court. It is stated that the appellants are ready and willing to
provide the same benefit to the original writ petitioners herein also. It is submitted, however, for
some oblique reason and/or to get some more benefits, only 18 tenants approached the High Court
and filed the writ petition.

6.13 The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respective appellants have vehemently
submitted that, on one hand, the High Court has specifically observed that, in paragraph 86, the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 8Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

High Court has not set aside and it is also not necessary for the High Court to set aside the layout
plan and the building permit granted by the NIT, the ultimate observation made by the High Court
in paragraph 89(2) would tantamount to quashing and setting aside the sanctioned layout plan and
even the building permit. 6.14 Making the above submissions and relying upon the provisions of
NIT Act as well as the MRTP Act and the decision of this Court in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra),
it is requested to allow the present appeals and quash and set aside the impugned judgment and
order passed by the High Court.

7. The present appeals are vehemently opposed by Ms. Rukhmini Bobde, learned Advocate
appearing for the writ petitioners and Ms. Deepa Kulkarni learned Advocate also. 7.1 The learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners have supported the impugned judgment
and order passed by the High Court.

7.2 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ
petitioners that the impugned judgment and order passed by this High Court is absolutely in
consonance with the provisions of the NIT Act as well as the MRTP Act, which is not required to be
interfered by this Court.

7.3 It is vehemently submitted by learned counsel for original writ petitioners that on true
interpretation of the provisions of NIT Act, more particularly Section 45(3) and 45 of the NIT Act,
the High Court has rightly observed and held that unless and until the Scheme sanctioned under the
NIT Act is varied and/or is modified under the provisions of the NIT Act, the Scheme shall prevail
and shall have to be acted upon.

7.4 The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners have emphasised on the
object and purpose to provide 15 metres internal road in the Scheme sanctioned under the NIT Act.
It is submitted that the internal road provided in the Scheme sanctioned under Section 45 of the
NIT Act was a part of Street Scheme so as to avoid the traffic congestion. It is submitted that the use
of land in question on the date of such Scheme was initially for residential purposes with internal
road, one cinema theatre and the peripheral area being used for shops/offices purposes. It is
submitted that the object and purpose for providing the internal road under the Scheme/Street
Scheme was for creating new or improving existing means of communication and facilities for
traffic. It is submitted that the execution of the Scheme was for (i) providing huge commercial
complex inside the Scheme area to accommodate the tenants apart from others, (ii) widening of
Mahatma Gandhi Road and Abhyankar Road outside the Scheme area; (iii) providing 50 ft (15
metres) wide internal road along with others two roads inside the Scheme area to ease out the traffic
and removing congestion, and (iv) to provide space open to sky for parking . It is submitted that,
therefore, once there was a Scheme/Street Scheme as sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act
with specific object and purpose, merely because in the Development Plan prepared under the
MRTP Act, there was no specific reference to the internal road, it cannot be said that the sanctioned
Scheme which was sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act is not to be implemented, even if the
same is not varied or modified under the provisions of the NIT Act.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 9Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

7.5 It is submitted that the High Court has rightly observed and held that unless and until the
Scheme is varied or is modified by the Planning Authority, which in the present case i.e. NIT, after
following the due process under Section 46 of the NIT Act, the Scheme has to be implemented and
anything including the sanction of the layout plan and/or grant of building permission which would
be in contravention of the Scheme under NIT Act, are illegal and contrary to the provisions of the
NIT as well as the MRTP Act, and, therefore, the High Court has rightly quashed and set aside the
demolition notices and has rightly observed that it would be open for the NIT to issue fresh notices
of demolition, after sanctioned plan, the building permit as well as construction, if any, carried out
are brought in conformity with the Scheme published under NIT Act on 23.06.1964.

7.6 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel that the impugned judgment and order passed
by the High Court is absolutely in furtherance of the object of the Scheme published under Section
45 of the NIT Act i.e. for better development and to avoid the traffic congestion. The learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court
in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra) reported in (2012) 3 SCC 619, in support of their submissions
that planning involving highly complex cities depends upon scientific research, study and
experience and, thus deserves due reverence and therefore, the Scheme which is prepared after due
consideration of necessity for better street planning has to be implemented, unless the same is
varied and/or is modified after following due procedure as required under the provisions of the NIT
Act.

7.7 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel that as the appellants have as such
subsequently implemented the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court by
modifying the Scheme which was earlier sanctioned and prepared under the NIT Act, as permitted
by the High Court and, therefore, now thereafter it is not open for the appellants to challenge the
impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court.

8. Now, so far as challenge to variation/modification of the Scheme under Section 46 of the NIT Act,
which is the subject matter of the Transfer Petition, it is vehemently submitted by the learned
counsel on behalf of the writ petitioners that the same is absolutely in breach of the provisions of the
NIT Act. It is submitted that a detail procedure required to be followed for variation and/or
modification of the Scheme as provided under the NIT Act has not been followed at all. It is
submitted that neither any objections were invited nor any opportunity was given to the writ
petitioners. It is submitted that, therefore, subsequent variation and/or modification of the Scheme
is absolutely illegal and deserves to be quashed and set aside. It is submitted that even the same can
be said to be in violation of the principles of natural justice. In support of the above, the learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitionersLthe tenants has heavily relied upon the decision
of this Court in Scheduled Caste and Weaker Section Welfare Association vs State of Karnataka
reported in (1991) 2 SCC SCC 604. 8.1 By making the above submission, it is requested to dismiss
the appeals and upheld the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court and to allow
the Transfer Petition and quash and set aside the variation and/or modification of the Scheme
published under Section 46 of the NIT Act.

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 10Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

9. Now, so far as the Transfer Petition is concerned, and challenge to the subsequent variation
and/or modification of the Scheme published under Section 46 of the NIT Act is concerned, the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the NIT as well as the original land owners and developers
have vehemently submitted that the Scheme is varied/modified after following due procedure
required under the provisions of the MRTP Act. It is submitted that, as per Section 39 of the MRTP
Act, where a final Development Plan contains proposals which are in variation, or modification of
those made in a Town Planning Scheme, which has been sanctioned by the State Government before
the commencement of the MRTP Act, the Planning Authority shall vary such Scheme suitably under
Section 92 to the extent necessary by the proposals made in the Final Development Plan. It is
submitted that Section 92 authorises the State Government to vary and/or modify the Scheme. It is
submitted that, therefore, if Sections 39 and 92 of the MRTP Act are conjointly read, it can be seen
that the variation of the Scheme subsequently shall be a formal action to bring the Scheme in
consonance with the Development Plan. It is submitted that, therefore, when the Development Plan
was sanctioned after inviting the objections etc. the subsequent variation of the Scheme to bring the
Scheme in consonance with the sanction Development Plan would be only a formality which is
required to be done under Section 92 of the MRTP Act. It is submitted that, therefore subsequent
variation and/or modification of the Scheme which in the present case would be as per Section 39
and Section 92 of the MRTP Act would be absolutely in consonance with the provisions of the MRTP
Act as well as the NIT Act. It is submitted that the provisions of the MRTP Act and NIT Act are
required to be read harmoniously to subLserve the objects and purposes of Sections 39 and Section
92 and other relevant provisions of the MRTP Act.

 

10. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original writ petitioners that in view of the fact
and subsequently the Scheme came to be varied as permitted by the High Court in the impugned
judgment and order and, therefore, the judgment and order passed by the High Court can be said to
have been implemented and, therefore, the appellants may not be permitted to challenge the
impugned judgment and order of the High Court is concerned, it is submitted that merely because
without prejudice and to be on safer side if the Scheme is varied and/or modified, it cannot be said
that appellants have waived their right to challenge the impugned judgment and order, more
particularly when the High Court by the impugned judgment and order has set aside the demolition
notices and virtually sought as to know that the sanctioned layout plan and validly granted the
building permit.

11. We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties. What is
challenged in the present batch of appeals is the impugned judgment and order dated 15.09.2016
passed by the Bombay High Court passed in Writ Petition No.2695 of 2015. On consideration of the
impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it appears that the following two questions
fell for determination before the High Court:

1. Whether mere absence of proposal of internal road in the final Development Plan under
subLéection (6) of section 31 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act and its existence
in the Scheme, published under Section 45 of the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, can be termed as
variation or modification, as contemplated by section 39 of the MRTP Act?,

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 11Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

1. Whether the impugned notices of demolition, based upon final layout plan sanctioned on
15052012 and the building permit granted on 27(06[4012 and revised on 114212014, need to be
set aside for want of Internal Road, which was the part of the Scheme sanctioned under Section 44
of the NIT Act? 11.1 It is required to be noted that initially demolition notices dated 24.04.2015 were
challenged before the High Court issued by the NIT. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the
said demolition notices were issued consequent upon the sanctioned layout plan dated 15.05.2012,
the building permit granted on 27.06.2012 and revised on 11.12.2014. Subsequently, by an
amendment, the original writ petitioners challenged the plan sanctioned by the NIT on 27.06.2012
and the sanction granted to the revised plan on 11.12.2014. The said amendment was allowed. The
challenge was mainly on the ground that the sanction granted is illegal and contrary to the Scheme.
The Scheme which was sanctioned in the year 1964 under Section 45 of the NIT Act provided 15
metres internal road. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the improvement Scheme known
as the Abhyankar Road Widening and Buty Mahal Street Scheme was prepared and sanctioned
under the provisions of NIT Act in the year 1964. However, thereafter, the MRTP Act came to be
enacted and came into effect subsequent to the enactment of the NIT Act i.e. with effect from
28.12.1966. From the chronology of list of events noted hereinabove it appears and it is not in
dispute that the First Final Development Plan under Section 31 of the MRTP Act came to be
sanctioned on 03.06.1976, which do not contain 15 metres internal road as was there in the Scheme
sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act. Even subsequently also, when the DP was revised in the
year 1989 and thereafter in 2001, the above internal road was not depicted in the revised DP. That
thereafter the Government allotted reconstituted composite plot under the MRTP Act and original
land owners/developers submitted the layout plan, which came to be sanctioned by the NIT and
even the building permission was granted under the provisions of the MRTP Act. Therefore, the NIT
issued the demolition notices dated 24.04.2015 impugned before the High Court so as to
allow/permit the original land owners/developers to put up the construction on the land in question
as per the sanctioned layout plan and the building construction permission. The High Court by the
impugned judgment and order has held that as in the Scheme sanctioned under Section 45 of the
NIT Act 15 metres internal road is provided, unless the same is varied and/or modified under
Section 46 of the NIT Act by the Planning Authority, the same shall have to be implemented and
thereby the High Court has quashed and set aside the notices of demolition dated 24.04.2015
keeping it open for the NIT to issue fresh notices of demolition to the original writ petitioners after
the sanctioned layout plan dated 15.05.2012, the building permit granted dated 27.06.2012 and
revised on 11.12.2014 as well as the construction, if any, carried out are brought in conformity with
the Scheme published under Section 45 of the NIT Act on 23.06.1964.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.2 Therefore, the short question which is posed for consideration before this Court is whether, in
the facts and circumstances of the case, when the Development Plan sanctioned under the
provisions of MRTP Act do not provide an internal road from the land in question, still the Scheme
published under Section 45 of the NIT Act which provided 15 metres internal road would be
applicable and/or would have to be implemented, though the Scheme may be contrary to the
Development Plan sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act ?

11.3 To answer the aforesaid question the object and purpose of MRTP Act, relevant provisions of
MRTP Act are required to be referred to and considered. 11.4 From the statement and object of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 42Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

MRTP Act 1966, it appears that the same has been enacted to make provisions for: (1) planning the
development and use of land in regions established for their purposes and for constitution of
Regional Planning Boards therefor; (2) to make better provisions for the preparation of
Development Plan with a view to ensuring that Town Planning Schemes are made in the proper
manner and the execution is made effective; (3) to provide for the compulsory acquisition of land
required for public purposes in respect of the plans, and (4) for purposes connected with the matters
aforesaid. The said Act is enacted to make provisions for planning the development and the use of
land in regions established for their purpose and to ensuring that Town Planning Schemes are made
in a proper manner and their execution is made effective. Therefore, the MRTP Act came to be
enacted with aforesaid object and purpose.

11.5 Section 3 of the Act permits the State Government to establish any area in the State to be a
region. A regional plan is supposed to be prepared for various subjects which are mentioned in
Section 14 of the Act. The Development Plan is defined under Section 2(9) of the Act as a plan for
the development or redevelopment of the area within the jurisdiction of Planning Authority. Section
2(19) defines the Planning Authority to mean a local authority, and it includes some other specified
authorities also. There is no dispute that the Development Plan has to be prepared in accordance
with the provisions of regional plan which is what is specifically stated in Section 21(1) of the Act.
11.6 Section 39 of the MRTP Act provides for DSection 39. Variation of town planning scheme by
development plan where a final development plan contains proposals which are in variation or
modification of those made in a town planning scheme which has been sanctioned by the State
Government before the commencement of this Act, the Planning Authority shall vary such scheme
suitably under Section 92 to the extent necessary by the proposals made in the final development
plan. 11.7 We are concerned with the Final Development Plan of 1976 which does not contain the 15
metres internal road from the land in question as against the 15 metres internal road provided in the
final Scheme of 1964. Thus the Scheme of 1964 prepared and sanctioned the provisions of the NIT
Act to the extent of providing 15 metres internal road can be said to be not in consonance with the
Development Plan sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act. 11.8 Section 43 of the MRTP
Act provides for restrictions on development of the land after the date on which the declaration of
intention to prepare the Development Plan for any area is published in the official gazette except as
provided under proviso to Section 43 of the Act. Section 46 of the MRTP Act provides that the
Planning Authority in considering the application for permission for development shall have due
regard to the provisions of any draft or final plan or proposals published by means of notice
submitted or sanctioned under the MRTP Act. Section 59 of the MRTP Act provides for preparation
of the Scheme under the MRTP Act, which specifically provides that the Planning Authority may
prepare one or more Town Planning Scheme for the area within its jurisdiction or any part thereof
for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the Final Development Plan. As such, we not
concerned with Section 59 of the MRTP Act, as in the present case, the Scheme which provides 15
metres internal road was prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of the NIT Act and prior to
the enactment of MRTP Act and, therefore, Section 39 read with Section 92 shall be applicable.

11.9 Therefore, on conjoint reading of Sections 39, 43, 46 and even Section 59 of the MRTP Act, the
Development Plans prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act shall prevail.

Therefore, there cannot be any development and/or construction permitted contrary to the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 13Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

Development Plan prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act, though the
Scheme prepared and sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act may permit such development
and/or construction. As such, the aforesaid view which we are taking is supported by the decision of
this Court in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra). In the case of Manohar Joshi (supra), after
considering the relevant provisions of the MRTP Act as well as the NIT Act, this Court has
specifically observed and held that when there is a conflict between the Development Plan prepared
and sanctioned under the provisions of MRTP Act and the Scheme sanctioned under the provisions
of the NIT Act, the DP shall override the TP Scheme. It is also further observed that even if the
variation, as directed under Section 39 of the MRTP Act does not take place, the land cannot be put
to use, in any way, in contradiction with the provisions of DP Plan. In the case of Manohar Joshi
(supra) this Court confirmed the findings recorded by the High Court that the DP Plan overrides the
TP Scheme. This Court did not accept the submission that the Development Plan and the TP Scheme
operate independent of each other and, until the State Government exercise its power of eminent
domain under the Development Plan, and acquires the land, the land owners can develop its
property as per the user permitted under the TP Scheme. While not accepting the above submission,
it is observed by this Court that permitting a development contrary to the provisions of the
Development Plan, knowing fully well that the user under the TP Scheme is at variance in the
Development Plan will make provisions of Sections 39, 42, 46 and 52 of the MRTP Act meaningless.
Therefore, the contrary observation and finding recorded by the High Court that unless and until the
Scheme is varied under Section 46 of the NIT Act as required under provisions of Section 39 of the
MRTP Act, the Scheme sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act shall subsist and can be
enforced, cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.

11.10 It is required to be noted that though in the Scheme sanctioned under the provisions of the
NIT Act proposing 15 metres internal road was in operation since 23.01.1964, when the MRTP Act
came into force and even thereafter when the First Development Plan was sanctioned under Section
31 of the MRTP Act for Nagpur in the year 1976 in which there was no proposal for 15 metres
internal road, and even thereafter, twice the Development Plan was revised first in the year 1989
and again in the year 2001 in which also there was no provision for the 15 metres internal road,
despite the above, at no point of time, anybody including the original writ petitioners challenged the
Development Plan under the MRTP Act in which the 15 metres internal road was not shown. Even
thereafter also, at no point of time, and even in the writ petition, the original writ petitioners
challenged and prayed to set aside the Development Plan in which there was no provision for 15
metres internal road, though the same was mentioned in the Scheme prepared and sanctioned
under Section 45 of the NIT Act.

11.11 It is also required to be noted that even the land owners/developers have got the layout plan
sanctioned and obtained the building permission under the provisions of the MRTP Act.
Considering the object and purpose of the MRTP Act noted hereinabove, it appears that though
there was a provision for internal 15 metres road in the Scheme under the NIT Act which was
sanctioned in the year 1964, thereafter much development had taken place and there are changed
circumstances. In the Development Plan/revised Development Plan the existing road came to be
widened from 12 metres to 24 metres and, therefore, when the DP was prepared and sanctioned
under the MRTP Act, there was no proposal for 15 metres internal wide road. As discussed

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 14Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

hereinabove, the Development Plan prepared and sanctioned under the MRTP Act would override
the TP Scheme. As observed hereinabove, there cannot be any development and/or construction
permitted contrary to the DP Plan under the MRTP Act. Under the circumstances, the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court cannot be sustained.

11.12 A faint attempt was made on behalf of the original writ petitioners that, in the DP Plan, there
was punctuated line which can be said to be 15 metres internal road from Abhyankar Road.
However, on considering the part plan of sanctioned Development Plan of Nagpur City sanctioned
by Notification dated 10.09.2001 (upon which the reliance has been placed by the original writ
petitioners), the aforesaid cannot be accepted. As rightly contended on behalf of the NIT, the
punctuated lines are described as Mouza Boundary/NIT Scheme Boundary. It is to be noted that
even the High Court noted that there is a conflict between the DP Plan and the Scheme sanctioned
under Section 45 of the NIT Act.

11.13 Even the findings recorded by the High Court that the action of the NIT in sanctioning the
layout plan and granting building permit is mischief of law, cannot be accepted. The layout plans are
sanctioned and the building permit has been granted absolutely in consonance with the DP
sanctioned under the MRTP Act. The demolition notices were received pursuant to and in
furtherance of the building permit and so as to enable the original land owners/developers to put up
the construction as per the layout plan sanctioned and the building permit granted. Therefore, the
High Court has erred in holding that the action of the NIT was mischief in law.

11.14 It is required to be noted that, on one hand, the High Court has specifically observed in
paragraph 86 that the High Court has not set aside and it is also not necessary for the High Court to
set aside the layout plan and the building permit granted by the NIT, the observations made by the
High Court in paragraph 89(2) would tantamount to virtually quashing and setting aside the
sanctioned layout plan in the building permit. The sum and substance and the resultant effect of the
observations made by the High Court in paragraph 89(2), the observation made by the High Court
in earlier part of the judgment virtually restrains the original land owners/developers not to put up
any construction on the building layout plan and the building permit granted under the MRTP Act.
Therefore, it appears that though not specifically quashing and setting aside the sanctioned layout
plan and the building permit granted under the MRTP Act, the High Court has nullified the
sanctioned layout plan and the building permit granted under the MRTP Act. 11.15 It is also required
to be noted that the dispute is pending since many years. The land owners/developers entered into
compromise with other similarly situated tenants. Now, only 18 tenants are opposing the
development, though the land owners/developers have agreed and are ready and willing to give
similar treatment to them also which would be given to other tenants as agreed before this Court. It
appears that for some reasons and/or to pressurize the land owners/ developers to give them some
more benefits, the original writ petitioners are opposing the development/construction. Though the
original land owners/developers are having the building permission and have got their plans
sanctioned under the provisions of MRTP Act and even after incurring huge expenses, they are not
in a position to put up any further construction because of the pending litigation. Therefore, the
equity would also be in favour of the appellants as land owners/developers. As, at this stage, it is
required to be noted that even those tenants with whom the original land owners/developers have

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 15Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

entered into a compromise before this Court have appeared through the Advocate and have stated
that they are out of possession since last more than ten years and therefore, they all have requested
to quash and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court and permit the
land owners/developers to complete the construction. 11.16 Insofar as the submission made by the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners that after the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court, the NIT has modified the Scheme as permitted by the
High Court and, therefore, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is acted
upon and, therefore, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court may not be
permitted to be challenged by the NIT and/or the developer is concerned, the same has no
substance. Merely because to avoid any further legal complication, if the NIT has modified the
Scheme that would not preclude the NIT and/or the original land owners/developers to challenge
the impugned judgment and order.

11.17 In view of the above submissions and for the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court deserves to be quashed and set aside.

TRANSFERRED CASE © No.23/2018:

12. Now, so far as the Transferred Case © No.23/2018 is concerned, the Writ Petition filed by the
original writ petitioners being Writ Petition No.5005 of 2017 has been transferred to this Court
pursuant to the order passed by this Court dated 03.11.2017. In the petition, the original writ
petitioner have prayed to quash and set aside the Notification dated 21.04.2017 issued by the NIT
and the NIT Resolution No.27/1167 dated 07.03.2017 and Resolution No.17/1165 dated 03.01.2017
by which the original Scheme of 1964 sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act has been modified
in exercise of power under Section 45 of the NIT Act and the 15 metres internal road has been
deleted.

12.1 It is vehemently submitted on behalf of the original writ petitioners that the Notification
modifying the Scheme and deleting 15 metres internal road is without following any procedure as
required under the Act and without inviting any objections and even the approval of the State
Government has not been obtained. However, considering the contents of the counter affidavit filed
on behalf of the NIT in which it is specifically stated that after considering the objections sent by the
15 writ petitioners in Petition No.2017, the Authority unanimously passed a Board Resolution in
exercise of power under Section 46 of the Act. Therefore, it cannot be said that no opportunity at all
was given to the petitioners. The decision to modify the Scheme by deleting 15 metres internal road
has been taken after considering the objections raised by the writ petitioners. It is required to be
noted that Section 39 of the MRTP Act mandates the Planning Authority to vary the Scheme in line
with the Development Plan sanctioned under the MRTP Act. It is required to be noted that when the
DP was sanctioned, without any proposal for the 15 metres internal road, first in the year 1976 and
thereafter in the years 1989 and 2001, the same was after following the due procedure and the same
was approved and sanctioned by the State Government. Therefore, thereafter, when the Scheme to
the extent in conflict with the DP Plan has been modified as mandated under Section 39 of the
MRTP Act, after considering the objections raised by the original writ petitioners, thereafter, the
same cannot be said to be illegal. Therefore, reading Section 39 of the MRTP Act and the provisions

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 16Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019
of the NIT Act harmoniously, the impugned Notification modifying the Scheme and/or Board
Resolution modifying the Scheme deleting 15 metres wide road, which would now be in line with the
Development Plan sanctioned under the MRTP Act, the same cannot be said to be illegal warranting
interference of this Court. Therefore, challenge to the Notification dated 21.04.2017 issued by the
NIT and the respective NIT Resolution modifying the Scheme deleting 15 metres internal road fails.

13. In view of the above and for the further reasons stated above, all the respective Civil Appeals are
hereby allowed and the impugned judgment and order dated 15.09.2016 passed by the High Court
of Bombay, Bench of Nagpur passed in Writ Petition No.2695 of 2015 is hereby quashed and set
aside.

13.1 The Transferred Case © No.23/2018 stands dismissed for the reasons stated hereinabove.
However, it is observed that to the respective original writ petitioners shall also be given the same
treatment as would be available/given to other tenants as agreed before this Court and/or as per the

settlement entered into with other tenants.

14. All these appeals are allowed accordingly with the above observations and the Transferred Case
stands dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.

JUDGMENT
Deepak Verma, J.
1. Leave granted.

2. The principal question that emerges for consideration in these appeals is whether to sustain the
order of demolition as passed by the Gauhati High Court vide impugned judgment and order or to
put an imprimatur of this Court to the unauthorised constructions raised by M/s. Priyanka Estates
International (P) Ltd. (Appellant No.1 herein) beyond 5= floors. Facts material for deciding the said
appeals are mentioned hereinbelow.

3. For the sake of convenience, the facts appearing in SLP (C) No. 14480 of 2006 titled as M/s
Priyanka Estates International (P) Ltd. & Others Vs. State of Assam & Others are taken into
consideration. Appellant No.1 is a company of which Appellant Nos.2 & 3 are Directors.

4. Appellant No.1 herein purchased an open piece of land approximately admeasuring 4.62 Kathas
from one Smt. Nandita Banerjee on 9.8.1999 by registered deed of sale. Prior to execution of sale,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 1Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

the vendor of Appellant No.1 applied to Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (hereinafter
referred to as 'GMDA’) for grant of “No Objection Certificate’ for sale of land. The said permission
was accorded on 17.7.1999 mentioning therein that permission is granted for
"residential-cum-commercial use" of the said plot and that proposed width of the road abutted by
plot is approximately 50 feet.

5. Pursuant to the said permission, Sale Deed was executed in favour of Appellant No.1, whereafter it
applied to Guwahati Municipal Corporation (hereinafter referred to as 'GMC') on 16.11.1999 for
according permission for construction of basement, ground, mezzanine, first, second, third, fourth
and half of 5th floors. The permission was accorded to M/s. Priyanka Estates International (P) Ltd.
on 03.02.2000 by the GMC for construction of basement, ground floor, mezzanine upto fourth floor
and half on the 5th floor. For 1st floor to fourth, the floor area permissible was 7283 sq. ft. but on 5th
floor, the permissible floor area was fixed at half of it, ie., 3817 sq. ft only. It was granted on certain
conditions as mentioned in the sanction dated 3.2.2000.

6. Thereafter, on 08.02.2000, Appellant No.1 applied for grant of permission for construction of
remaining part of 5th , 6th, 7th and 8th floors. This permission was refused by GMC on 27.3.2000
on the following grounds.

"j{) Maximum allowable height of building can be 76' and proposed height would be

93 
ii) The margin on both sides and rear is less than required norms.

iii) FAR is exceeded than allowable 300.
iv) The structural certificate is not
submitted."

So, proposal for 5th (part) 6th, 7th and 8th floor building, permission was rejected.
7. Feeling aggrieved by the said rejection by GMC, appellants preferred an appeal under Section 438
of the Guwahati Municipal Corporation Act, 1971 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act’) before the
Standing Appellate Committee (in short 'SAC’).
8. This came to be disposed of on 5.5.2000 with the following directions:
"In view of the above discussion as well as observation, in our considered opinion, the
appellant's case deserve consideration. Accordingly, we hold that the appellant be
accorded permission as sought for. We hereby set aside the impugned order, as
aforesaid, passed by the Commissioner, GMC, the Respondent.

In the result, the appeal is allowed."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 2Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009
9. Since, despite the fact that SAC had allowed the appeal of Appellants with regard to construction
of 5th (part), 6th, 7th and 8th floors, no formal permission was still accorded by Commissioner
GMC to it, they moved further application on 28.8.2001 before Administrator-cum- Minister,
Guwahati Development Department, as it appears by that time, GMC had been dissolved.

10. The said appeal was considered by Administrator-cum- Minister and the appeal verdict was
reviewed on 29.5.2002 with certain conditions as mentioned hereinbelow :

"i) To obtain NOC from State Fire Department;
ii) Submit affidavit regarding the Structural Certificate;

iii) Compulsory covered parking and private service system like drainage, sewage,
storm drain, water supply etc.;

iv) No further FAR beyond 487.00;

v) To submit completion certificate and
obtain Occupancy Certificate from GMC;

vi) To pay a penal charge to the Corporation
amounting to Rs.10,00,000.00 (ten lacs);

vii) Your building is liable for instant demolition at your own risk and cost in case of
non-compliance of the above."

11. However, it appears that without compliance of the aforesaid conditions fully and without getting
actual sanction for construction of building beyond 5= floors from the Commissioner of G.M.C.
Appellants continued with the construction activities and tried to complete the same.

12. Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (As already referred to as 'GMDA') now came
into picture and issued notice to Appellant No.2 on 02.02.2001 to show cause and to give
explanation as to without grant of proper sanction under GMDA Act, how the construction work is
progressing.

13. Another notice by GMDA was issued to the Appellant No.2 on 5.9.2001 asking to
remove/demolish the building/construction/ development or the portion erected by them which is
in violation of the provisions of Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority Act (for short 'the
Development Act'). No replies to the aforesaid two notices were sent by the Appellants herein on the
ground that the same were not received.

14. Last and final notice in this regard was issued by GMDA on 18.2.2002 mentioning therein with
regard to earlier two notices sent on 2.2.2001 and 5.9.2001 and finally asking the Appellants to

remove the construction within three days from the receipt of this last notice failing which,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 3Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

necessary action as per provision of the Development Act will be initiated without giving further
intimation.

15. Appellants replied to the said last notice on 18.2.2002 mentioning therein that they had not
received the earlier two letters but mentioned that permission has been granted by GMC on
3.2.2000, and is still operative, which clarified the position of construction of the building beyond
5= floors also but did not actually present any sanctioned or approved plans/maps beyond 5= floor.

16. Not being satisfied with the reply to the show cause notice, submitted by the Appellants, the
Respondents proceeded to issue another notice to the Appellant No.2 on 3.5.2002, with a
categorical statement that construction over and above 6th and 7th floor was wholly illegal, without
due sanction and therefore, the same be removed/demolished.

17. It appears that, thereafter, some correspondence between the parties continued. Finally on
31.7.2002 by two orders, the Commissioner, GMC informed the Appellant No.1 that plans submitted
by them are insufficient for the following reasons and requested it to furnish the required materials
as under and to forthwith stop the construction :

"1. Affidavit for structural design as per format at the building bye laws.

2. NOC from State Fire Department.

3. Declaration in affidavit to maintain the FAR within 487."
18. The Appellants, therefore, were constrained to move the High Court challenging the said order
dated 31.7.2002 by filing W.P.(C) No.5018 of 2002 purportedly under Articles 226 and 227 of
Constitution of India.
19. Further order of demolition came to be issued to the Appellant No.2 by GMDA on 30.5.2006,
clearly mentioning therein that no sanction was obtained by the Appellants under Section 24 & 25 of
the Development Act and had actually violated the provisions of Building Bye-laws of Guwahati
Municipal Corporation (for short, building bye-laws'), in the following manner :

"1. FAR of the building is 490 which exceeds allowable FAR 300.

2. Maximum floor height 93' exceeds allowable height 76' in this road.

3. Since the building is mixed used with residential at top floors, setback required is 15' side to 20'
rear, which is not maintained.

4. Balcony projection is allowed, maximum < of the building length in any side, which is not
maintained.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 4Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

5. Two staircases and lift on opposite direction is required which is not available in the building as
per building plan.

6. Construction of building is going on
despite our order to stop construction."

20. The said order further directed demolition of the

building beyond the sanctioned plan dated 3.2.2000. The Appellants, therefore, challenged the said
order dated 30.5.2006 issued by Chief Executive Officer GMDA by filing another W.P.(C)No.2747 of
2006. In W.P.(C) No.5018 of 2002, (earlier W.P. filed in the Gauhati High Court) an order of status
quo came to be passed on 12.8.2002 and it further directed that Municipal Authority shall take no
steps to pull down the building and the operation of the letter dated 31.7.2002 was stayed.

21. It appears that pursuant to the said order, Appellants continued with the construction activities
presumably on the ground that order of status quo is against the Respondents of the Writ Petition
and not against the Appellants. Thus, Sanatan Dharam Sabha, Guwahati filed an application seeking
permission to be impleaded in the said petition and also bringing to its notice that despite the order
of maintenance of status quo, Appellants are continuing with the construction. Thus, another order
clarifying the earlier order came to be passed by the High Court on 20.9.2002 whereby a categorical
direction was issued that no further construction over the said land shall be made and all
construction activities should come to a standstill immediately. It appears that only after passing the
said order, Appellants stopped the construction work.

22. Sanatan Dharam Sabha alongwith three residents of Panbazar locality of Guwahati city filed
W.P.(C) No.5146 of 2002 in the Gauhati High Court against the action of GMC and GMDA granting
permission to the appellant, M/s. Priyanka Estates for multi-storeyed building in question and
prayed for its demolition.

23. Thus, all the three petitions, i.e. W.P.(C) No.5018/2002, W.P.(C) No.2747/2006 and W.P.(C)
No.5146/2002 were consolidated for the purpose of analogous hearing and have been disposed of by
Division Bench of Gauhati High Court vide impugned judgment and order dated 28.7.2006. Vide
impugned judgment, the Writ Petitions preferred by Appellants herein numbered as 5018/02 and
2747/06 having been found devoid of merit and substance were dismissed but W.P.(C) No.
5146/2002 filed by Sanatan Dharam Sabha has been allowed to the extent indicated in the
impugned order.

24. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and order, civil appeal arising out
of S.L.P.(C)No.14480/06 titled, 'M/s. Priyanka Estates International (P) Ltd. & Ors. vs. State of
Assam & Ors." has been filed by Builder and its Directors; civil appeals arising out of S.L.P.(C)
No.15546/06 titled, 'Vishal Saraf v. State of Assam & Ors.' and civil appeal arising out of
S.L.P.(C)No.15547/06 titled, ‘Suresh Kumar Harlalka v. State of Assam & Ors.' have been filed by
owners of flats on 7th floor and civil appeal arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 16898/06 titled, 'Sarla Devi
Lahoty vs. State of Assam & Ors.' has been filed by owner of one flat on 6th floor. Insofar as civil

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 5Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

appeals arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos.28291-28294/20009 titled, ‘Shyam Sunder Agarwala vs. State of
Assam & Ors.' are concerned, the same have been filed by owner of one flat on 5th floor only. Since
the matters were common and identical challenging primarily the order passed by Division Bench of
the High Court and pertained to the same building claiming identical reliefs, these Appeals have
been heard together. Perused the records.

25. Mr. Shekhar Naphade, leaned Senior Counsel, Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, learned Senior Counsel with
Mr. Shankar Divate, Mr. Dhruv Mehta, Mr. Yashraj Singh Deora, Advocates, Mr. Vijay Hansaria,
learned Senior Counsel with Mr. P.I. Jose and Mr. Kamal Mohan Gupta, Advocates appeared for the
Appellants in the aforesaid appeals. Mr. L. Nageshwar Rao, learned Senior Counsel with Ms. Millie
Hazarika and Mr. Manish Goswami appeared for the Respondents.

26. Respondents have contended that for construction of any building, permission from GMC is a
condition precedent and unless such permission is granted no construction can be raised.

27. It has further been submitted that such construction has to be as per the sanctioned plan
approved by GMC and no deviation from such approved plan can be made.

28. According to them, Appellant No.1 was admittedly granted permission for construction of 5=
storeyed building, apart from basement, ground and mezzanine floor vide order dated 03.02.2000,
thereafter, no further permission has been granted for raising any construction on remaining part of
5th floor and upwards. The order of the SAC dated 05.05.2000 setting aside the order of
Commissioner, GMC dated 27.3.2000 rejecting the permission to raise construction on part of the
5th floor up to 8th floor was itself illegal, beyond the jurisdiction and competence of SAC as it
violated the building bye-laws.

29. In view of the admitted position that the width of the road is only 38 feet and under the building
bye-laws, maximum allowable height can be double the width of the road, i.e., 76 feet but in the
instant case the SAC has allowed construction upto 93 feet, which contravenes the building
bye-laws, therefore, such an order of SAC has no legal force and cannot be basis for construction
beyond 76 feet, allowable under building bye-laws.

30. It has been submitted by them that the order of the SAC dated 05.05.2000 lost its force and
sanctity after the communication dated 29.05.2002 was issued by GMC by which the Appellants
were asked to comply with certain conditions before granting any permission for construction of a
building for remaining part of 5th floor and above.

31. It has also been contended that even though the order passed in Appellants' Writ Petition was to
maintain status quo but taking advantage thereof, they continued with the construction and only on
subsequent order being passed on 20.09.2002, the construction activities were stopped but by that
time Appellants had already raised construction upto 8th floor, in flagrant violation of building
bye-laws.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 6Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

32. They have also contended that GMDA passed an order under Section 88 of the Development Act
for demolition of construction for remaining part of the 5th floor and above and that too after
issuance of notices to Appellants and giving reasonable opportunity to them to show cause.
Appellants were aware that construction beyond 5= floor was without due sanction and approval,
thus, obviously illegal, yet they continued with the same.

33. They further submitted that there was no violation of principles of natural justice. It was
contended that Appendix III of the building bye-laws provides for compoundable and noncompoundable items. It is evident therefrom that construction of extra floor falls in the category of
non-compoundable items meaning thereby if extra floor is constructed without due
sanction/approval, then, it would be beyond the purview of compoundable items. As regards
violation of principles of natural justice, they have contended that before passing the order of
demolition, notices were issued to the Appellants to show cause, as required under Section 88 of
Development Act but they did not take any action thereon.

34. Whenever Respondents asked for sanctioned/approved plans for construction beyond 5= floors,
Appellants only showed them the plans which were sanctioned and/or approved for construction of,
only upto 5= floors. It was also contended by them that even upto that stage Appellants had failed to
show any approved sanctioned plans and maps allowing them to construct beyond the permissible
limit of 5= floors. Thus, they have contended that the building constructed beyond 5= floors is
absolutely illegal, unauthorized and without any sanction plans, thus liable to be demolished.

35. In order to understand the various provisions of the Act, it is necessary to know the import of the
relevant sections of the Act material for deciding the appeals.

36. Section 327 of the Act prohibits any person from erecting or re-erecting any building without
written permission from the Corporation. Section 328 provides for submission of an application by a
person interested to erect or re-erect a building to the Corporation for approval of the site together
with site plan with land title document, elevation and sections of the building, specification of the
work and also containing such particulars as may be required by bye-laws in that behalf. Section 329
empowers the Commissioner of the GMC to refuse such permission and to disapprove the site on
the grounds formulated in Section 330. Section 331 provides for the grounds on which permission to
erect or re-erect the building can be refused by GMC. Section 332 empowers the Commissioner to
direct modification of the sanctioned plan. Section 333 stipulates the period within which erection
or re-erection is to be completed. Section 337 empowers the Commissioner to require the removal or
alteration of the work which may not be in conformity with bye- laws etc. Section 416 of the Act
empowers the GMC to formulate different bye-laws including the bye-laws relating to the building.
Section 438 of the Act provides for appeal from the order passed by the Commissioner including the
order refusing to grant permission to construct or re-construct a building to the SAC. Sub-section
(3) of Section 438 of the Act empowers the State Govt. to call for the records of any matter from the
Corporation and to pass such orders as may be deemed necessary after examination of such records.

37. It is necessary to refer to Section 88 of the Development Act which reads as under :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 7Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

"88. Power of demolition of building.-(1) Where any development has been
commenced or is being carried on or has been completed in contravention of the
Master Plan or development scheme or without the permission, approval or sanction
referred to in Section 25 and Section 30 of the Act or in contravention of any
conditions subject to which such permission, approval or sanction has been granted,
the authority may in addition to any prosecution that may be instituted under the
Act, make an order directing that such development shall be removed by demolition,
filling or otherwise by the owner, occupier, manager or by any person at whose
instance the development has been commenced or is being carried out or has been
completed within such period not being less than five days and more than thirty days
from the date on which a copy of the order of removal with brief statement of the
reasons thereof has been delivered to the owner, occupier and manager or the person
at whose instance the development has been commenced or is being carried out or
has been completed as may be specified in the order and on his failure to comply with
the order, the authority may remove or cause to be removed the development and the
expenses of such removal shall be recovered from the owner, occupier, manager or
any person at whose instance the development was commenced or was being carried
out or was completed as arrears of land revenue; provided that no such order shall be
made unless the owner, occupier, manager or the person concerned has been given a
reasonable opportunity to show cause why the order shall not be made.

(2) The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any
other provision relating to demolition of buildings contained in any other law for the
time being in force.

(3) No compensation shall be claimed by any person for any damage which he may
sustain in consequence of the removal of any development under this section or the
discontinuance of the development under Section 87 of this Act."

38. Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned Senior Counsel for Appellants firstly strenuously contended
before us that NOC dated 17.7.1999 granted by GMDA clearly stipulated that the plot purchased by
Appellants would fall in the category of "residential-cum-commercial use" and width of the road
abutted by the plot is proposed to be 50 feet. Thus, according to him, the height of the building can
be 100 feet, being the double of the width of the road. Since the height of the building of the
Appellants even after construction upto 8th floors is only 93 feet, the part of the building beyond 5=
floors is not liable to be demolished.

39. It was also contended by him that initial permission was granted by GMC whereas notices of
demolition have been issued by GMDA which appears to be absolutely contrary and against the
provisions of law. It was also contended that Respondents have failed to prove that any notices were
sent to them on 02.02.2001 or 05.09.2001 by GMDA as it has been categorically mentioned by the
Appellants pursuant to third notice received by them and replied to.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 8Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

40. It was also argued that in the light of specific order passed by SAC, conscious decision has been
taken by the Government and denial of hearing itself would amount to prejudice, consequently,
violation of principles of natural justice.

41. If Commissioner was dissatisfied with the modification of his order by the SAC then as provided
under sub-section (2) of Section 438 of the Act, he was required to make a reference to the
Corporation within 60 days thereof which he failed to do. He was, therefore, bound by the Appellate
Order of SAC and could not have super-imposed his own views or conditions.

42. Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Shyam Sunder Agarwala submitted
that he is owner of part of the 5th floor which has not been sanctioned.

43. According to Mr. Mukul Rohtagi half of the 5th floor has already been sanctioned and even if the
width of the road abutted to the building is taken as 38 feet, the height allowed would be 76 feet.
Thus, it will have no height problem. At the most, the only objection can be with regard to FAR
which objection can be waived as the same falls within compoundable items.

44. Shri Shyam Sunder Agarwala had purchased the said flat on 18.04.2005 for a total amount of
Rs.9,43,850. It has also been contended that after purchase of the said flat his name has been
mutated in the Corporation records. He is paying property tax, water tax etc., which Corporation is
accepting. Thus, for this reason also it is not liable to be demolished.

45. He further contended that two parallel bodies, that is, GMC and GMDA cannot take action for
demolition of the building as the permission was accorded by GMC whereas notices of demolition
have been issued by GMDA. Thus, according to him, whole procedure is illegal and void, thus liable
to be quashed.

46. In the light of this, it has been contended that Section 88 of the Development Act could not be
put into service against the Appellants as the same amounts to violation of principles of natural
justice as no notice has been served on the said Appellant.

47. Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Counsel appearing for other Appellants submitted that they
are owners of flat No.7A/7C and 7D having purchased on 14.06.2004 and 03.01.2005 for a sum of
Rs.17,72,460 and 9,43,850 respectively. He has reiterated that Section 88 of the Development Act
has not been complied with inasmuch as no opportunity to show cause has been given to these
Appellants, thus violation of principles of natural justice is writ large from the record. Commissioner
had no other alternative but to abide by the Appellate Order of SAC and in any case it should have
been treated as deemed sanction.

48. Shri Kamal Mohan Gupta, learned counsel appearing for Sarla Devi Lahoty, owner of a flat on
6th floor has also reiterated the aforesaid arguments already advanced by M/s. Shekhar Naphade,
Vijay Hansaria and Mukul Rohtagi. Additionally, he has submitted that Sarla Devi Lahoty purchased
a flat on 27.12.2004 for Rs. 8,63,010, after making due inquiries with regard to sanction of building
plans etc. Thus, she would be a bonafide purchaser for value and for any acts of omission or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 9Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

commission said to have been committed by builder M/s. Priyanka Estates International Pvt. Ltd.
this Appellant cannot be put to any loss.

49. After having gone through the record carefully, the crux of the matter is whether M/s. Priyanka
Estates International Pvt. Ltd. is in possession of any approved or sanctioned plan beyond 5= floors,
ie., for the remaining 3= floors or not. If not, then what is the effect thereof?

50. It is clear from the record that the only plan approved was on 03.02.2000 for 5= floors by GMC.
Order dated 05.05.2000 passed by SAC also does not give them blanket permission to construct
upto 8th floor.

51. It is also to be seen that respondents have come to the conclusion and have fairly conceded
before us that plan or sanction approved by either of the two authorities, that is, GMC or GMDA will
hold good and permission from both the authorities simultaneously would not be required for the
same, if it has already been accorded by any one of the authorities.

52. On the strength of this, we can safely proceed that if no permission under Section 24 and 25 of
the Development Act was obtained by M/s. Priyanka Estates International Pvt. Ltd. then it would
not be detrimental to the interest of the Appellants, provided there is sanction and approval of plans
by the Corporation for remaining 3= floors i.e. beyond 5= floors.

53. Here, it is pertinent to point out that Respondents had also issued a public notice on
02.07.2002, published in local newspaper in vernacular giving general warning and information to
all proposed purchasers of flats that unless builder is able to show Completion Certificate and
Occupancy Certificate duly issued by authorities, no one should enter into agreement to purchase
flat/flats from the builder. It is, therefore, to be construed that public notice will hold good even
with regard to adherence to the requirement of Section 88 of the Development Act, if individual
person had not been noticed by the authorities.

54. Clause (a) of building bye-law 37 stipulates that for the purpose of calculation of building height,
existing width of the road shall be taken into account and not the proposed width. Even if the
proposed width is 40 feet or 50 feet, it will not make any difference because it clearly contemplates
that what is to be taken into consideration is the existing width of the road. There is nothing on
record to show that the existing width of the road is more than 38 feet. Thus, at the most, the
construction could have been only upto the height of 76 feet, provided there was sanction granted by
either of the two Authorities.

55. Appendix III of building bye-laws deals with penalties to be levied for violation of provisions of
Master Plans, Zoning Plans Regulations and Bye-laws. Certain items are compoundable items but
certain items fall in the category of non-compoundable items. However, addition of extra floor falls
in the category of non-compoundable items. Thus, in any case anything that has been constructed
beyond 5th floor would be non-compoundable and same cannot be compounded at all. In other
words, minor deviations from the sanctioned plan should be confined only to the FAR permissible
but should not extend to the extra floor.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 10Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

56. For better appreciation of the aforesaid provision the same is reproduced hereinbelow :
"Appendix III PENALTIES TO BE LEVIED FOR VIOLATIONS OF PROVISION OF
MASTER PLAN/ZONING PLAN REGULATIONS AND BYE LAWS.

(i) All provisions of Bye-laws except items given below shall not be
compounded/regularized and shall have to be rectified by alteration/demolition at

the risk and cost of owner.

Compoundable items:

(1) Coverage - Maximum of 15%
(2) F.A.R. - maximum of 10%
(3) Set Back - Upto 2'- 6"
(4) Open Space - Maximum 10% reduction
(5) Total Height of - 1.5%
Building

Non Compoundable items:

(1)Use of building

(2)Addition of extra floor

(3)Parking Norms

(4)Parking Norms

(5)Projection/encroachment of public
land."

Critical and analytical perusal of the same would show that addition of extra floor
falls within the ambit of non
compoundable items.

57. The order of SAC cannot be construed as an order of sanction as it is not a semblance of
permission. It was not end of the matter because necessary sanction or permission could have been
granted only by the Municipal Commissioner and not by the Appellate Authority. Admittedly, even
after passing of the order by SAC in appeal, there was no further sanction by the Municipal
Commissioner or by Chief Executive Officer of the Development Authority granting permission to
raise the height of the building upto 8th floor.

58. Thus, looking to the matter from all angles, we are of the opinion that construction of the
building beyond 5= floors was not only illegal, unauthorized and without any sanction or approval of
plans but was also against the spirit of Appellate Order of SAC. Thus, except for directing the
Respondent- authorities to demolish 6th, 7th and 8th floor, we are left with no alternative.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 11Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

59. As regards construction of two flats on remaining half of 5th floor, Mr. L. Nageshwar Rao,
learned Senior Counsel for Respondent-authorities fairly conceded that on suitable representations
being made by the occupants, their cases can be considered afresh to find out if the same would fall
within the category of compoundable items or not. If the same are found within the category of
compoundable items then necessary order by respondents in this regard would be passed otherwise
order of demolition would follow for them also. Thus, on the promise of Sr. Advocate Mr. L.
Nageshwar Rao, we hope and trust, suitable orders would be passed by the Authorities as regards
two flats on 5th floor are concerned within two months from the date of submission of the
Representations.

60. Even though various authorities had been placed before us by the learned counsel appearing for
parties, it is not required to deal with them in extenso. However, a cursory reference to the same
would meet the ends of justice.

61. Mr. Shekhar Naphade has placed reliance on Corporation of Calcutta v. Mulchand Agarwala AIR
1956 SC 110 to contend that it should be a last resort to direct demolition of a building and if it falls
within the compoundable limit then it should not be directed to be demolished. To advance
contentions further in this regard, reliance has been placed on para 4 of an order of this Court in the
case of Syed Muzaffar Ali & Others v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi 1995 Supp. (4) SCC 426 which
is reproduced hereunder :

"4. However, it is to be pointed out that mere departure from the authorized plan or
putting up a construction without sanction does not ipso facto and without more
necessarily and inevitably justify demolition of the structure. There are cases and
cases of such unauthorized constructions. Some are amenable to compounding and
some may not be. There may be cases of grave and serious breaches of the licensing
provisions or building regulations that may call for extreme stage of demolition.

62. Reliance has also been placed on yet another judgment of this Court in the case of Muni
Suvrat-Swamy Jain S.M.P. Sangh v. Arun Nathuram Gaikwad & Others (2006) 8 SCC 590, which
dealt with Section 351 of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act to hold that if execution of work
has commenced contrary to provisions of the Act, then to give notice to the person carrying on the
construction work to show cause why it should not be pulled down, is a must. The use of the word
"shall" would signify that it is mandatory to issue notice and then to pass any order. Lastly, a recent
judgment of this Court in the case of Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana v. Inderjit Singh & Anr.
(2008) 13 SCC 506 has been pressed into service. This also deals primarily with the requirement of
issuance of show cause notice to the person who had raised construction, so as to enable the said
party to show cause, if the construction has been made in total violation of the sanctioned map or it
falls within the category of compoundable items.

63. Mr. Vijay Hansaria has placed reliance on the famous off-quoted judgment of this Court in the
case of Olga Tellis and Others etc. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation & Others etc. (1985) 3 SCC 545
which dealt with plight of the pavement dwellers, who were in unauthorised possession and were
sought to be evicted. He sought to contend that the fundamental rule of principles of natural justice

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 42Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

should have been followed before passing the order of demolition.

64. Further with regard to opportunity of hearing he has placed reliance on a judgment of this Court
in the case of S.L. Kapoor v. Jagmohan and Others (1980) 4 SCC 379.

65. On the other hand, Mr. L. Nageshwar Rao has placed reliance on various judgments of this
Court, viz., M.I. Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. Radhey Shyam Sahu and Others (1999) 6 SCC 464; Friends
Colony Development Committee v. State of Orissa and Others (2004) 8 SCC 733; Royal Paradise
Hotel (P) Ltd. Vs. State of Haryana and Others (2006) 7 SCC 597; and Mahendra Buburao Mahadik
and Others v. Subhash Krishna Kanitkar and Others (2005) 4 SCC 99 to contend that where
constructions have been made in absolute and flagrant violation of the sanctioned plan then the only
alternative is to direct demolition of the same.

66. It is not necessary to deal with the aforesaid judgments of this Court in greater detail as the
consistent ratio decidendi of this Court is that if the constructions are in absolute violation of
sanctioned or approved plans and are not likely to fall in the category of compoundable items, then
the necessary consequence is to order its demolition and seal of approval for such illegal activities is
not required to be given by this Court.

67. It is pertinent to mention here that hearing of the appeals had commenced on 22.10.2009 and
had almost concluded on 28.10.2009. But on the said date, Mr. Anoop George Chaudhary and Ms.
June Chaudhary, learned Senior Counsel, appeared with Mr. Kamal Mohan Gupta for Sarla Devi
Lahoty and submitted that they would be replying to the arguments advanced by learned counsel for
Respondents. Though not approved as a healthy practice, yet we granted them permission.

68. It was submitted by them that if cases of two flat owners on the 5th floor are to be considered so
as to find out whether the constructions raised by the builder in their cases would fall within the
compoundable items or not, then the case of Sarla Devi Lahoty should also be directed to be
considered on a suitable representation being made by her, as her flat is situated on the 6th floor. It
was contended that even after taking the height of 6th floor, it would not cross the maximum height
of 76 feet looking to the width of the existing road.

69. However, the said contention cannot be accepted as construction of an extra floor does not fall
within the category of compoundable items which is manifest from Appendix III of the building
bye-laws of the Corporation reproduced hereinabove.

70. However, with regard to two flats on 5th floor, a direction can be given to the Respondents to
consider their cases if they submit their representations within a period of 30 days hereof.
Respondents would examine whether their cases fall within the compoundable items/limit or not. In
case, Respondents come to the conclusion that these two flats constructed on 5th floor fall within
the compoundable limit, then necessary orders be passed in this regard, after charging
compounding fees as may be applicable to the facts of the case, in accordance with law, otherwise,
they would also face the wrath of demolition.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 13Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

71. Even a conjoint reading of the order dated 05.05.2000 passed by SAC and the order dated
29.05.2002 of the Administrator-cum-Minister makes it clear as noon day that it does not clothe the
Appellants to continue with the construction work beyond 5= floors as these orders were passed
subject to fulfilling certain conditions contained therein.

72. It is obvious that what would ultimately constitute a sanctioned and duly approved map would
be the one approved by the Commissioner as he alone has authority to do so. The Appellants have
failed to produce any such duly approved map.

73. It is a matter of common knowledge that illegal and unauthorised constructions beyond the
sanctioned plans are on rise, may be due to paucity of land in big cities. Such activities are required
to be dealt with by firm hands otherwise builders/colonisers would continue to build or construct
beyond the sanctioned and approved plans and would still go scot-free. Ultimately, it is the flat
owners who fall prey to such activities as the ultimate desire of a common man is to have a shelter of
his own. Such unlawful constructions are definitely against the public interest and hazardous to the
safety of occupiers and residents of multi-storeyed buildings. To some extent both parties can be
said to be equally responsible for this. Still the greater loss would be of those flat owners whose flats
are to be demolished as compared to the Builder.

74. Even though on earlier occasions also, under similar circumstances, there have been judgments
of this Court which should have been a pointer to all the builders that raising unauthorised
construction never pays and is against the interest of society at large, but, no heed to it has been
given by the builders. Rules, regulations and bye-laws are made by Corporation or by Development
Authorities, taking in view the larger public interest of the society and it is a bounden duty of the
citizens to obey and follow such rules which are made for their benefit. If unauthorised
constructions are allowed to stand or given a seal of approval by court then it is bound to affect the
public at large. An individual has a right, including a fundamental right, within a reasonable limit, it
inroads the public rights leading to public inconvenience, therefore, it is to be curtailed to that
extent.

75. The jurisdiction and power of courts to indemnify a citizen for injuries suffered due to such
unauthorised or illegal construction having been erected by builder/coloniser is required to be
compensated by them. An ordinary citizen or a common man is hardly equipped to match the might
and power of the builders.

76. In the case in hand, it is noted that number of occupiers were put in possession of the respective
flats by the builder/developer constructed unauthorisedly in violation of the laws. Thus, looking to
the matter from all angles it cannot be disputed that ultimately the flat owners are going to be the
greater sufferers rather than builder who has already pocketed the price of the flat.

77. It is a sound policy to punish the wrong-doer and it is in that spirit that the courts have moulded
the reliefs of granting compensation to the victims in exercise of the powers conferred on it. In doing
so, the courts are required to take into account not only the interest of the petitioners and the
respondents but also the interest of public as a whole with a view that public bodies or officials or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/471107/ 14Priyanka Estates I'National ... vs State Of Assam & Ors on 3 December, 2009

builders do not act unlawfully and do perform their duties properly.

78. In the case in hand, admittedly, at no point of time Appellant No.1- M/s. Priyanka Estates
International Pvt. Ltd. was able to show to its prospective purchasers the Occupancy Certificate or
Completion Certificate issued by the authorities concerned. The same could not even be shown to us
and without it, Appellant No.1 could not have embarked into sale of flats as it was mandatorily
required.

79. The instant case is not a case of breach of contract. It is a clear case of breach of the obligation
undertaken to erect the building in accordance with building regulations and failure to truthfully
inform the warranty of title and other allied circumstances.

80. Even though at the first instance, we thought of invoking this Court's jurisdiction conferred
under Article 142 of the Constitution of India so as to do complete justice between the parties and to
direct awarding of reasonable/suitable compensation/interest to the flat owners, whose flats are
ultimately going to be demolished, but, with a very heart, we have restrained ourselves from doing
so, for variety of reasons and on account of various disputed questions that may be posed in the
matter. However, we grant liberty to those, whose flats are ultimately going to be demolished, to
exhaust the remedy that may be available to them in accordance with law.

81. We also feel it necessary and expedient to direct the Respondent-authorities that if ultimately
flat owners, whose flats are going to be demolished shall be given at least three months' time to
vacate the same. This would enable them to mitigate the losses that may be incurred by them. We
accordingly direct so.

82. In the light of the foregoing discussions, these appeals are dismissed with the directions
contained hereinabove. Respondent-authorities shall be at liberty to proceed with demolition of half
of the 5th floor, if not ultimately compounded; 6th, 7th and 8th floors as mentioned hereinabove.

83. Counsel's fee Rs. 10,000/- each.

Officer of the army when on December 27, 1974 he took over
as the Officer Commanding 38 Coy. A.S.C. (Sup) Type 'A'
attached to the Military Hospital, Jhansi. In August, 1975
the Appellant went to attend a training course and returned
in the first week of November. 1975. In his absence Captain
G.C. Chhabra was commanding the unit of the appellant and he
submitted a Contingent Bill dated September 25, 1975 for
Rs.16,280 for winter liveries of the depot civilian chowkidars and sweepers. The said Bill was returned by the Con
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

troller of Defence Accounts (CDA) with certain objections.
Thereupon the appellant submitted a fresh contingent Bill
dated December 25, 1975 for a sum of Rs.7,029.57. In view of
the wide difference in the two Contingent Bills, the CDA
reported the matter to the Headquarters for investigation
and a Court Enquiry blamed the appellant for certain lapses.

After considering the said report of the Court of Enquiry the General Officer Commanding, M.P., Bihar and Orissa
recommended that ‘severe displeasure' (to be recorded) of
the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Central
Command be awarded to the appellant. The General Officer
Commanding-in-Chief Central Command, however. did not agree
with the said opinion and by order dated August 26, 1977
directed that disciplinary action be taken against the
appellant for the lapses.

Pursuant to the said order a charge sheet dated July 20,
1978 containing three charges was served on the appellant
and it was directed that he be tried by General Court Martial. The first charge was, doing of a thing with intent to

defraud under section 52(f) of the Act. The second charge
was alternative to the first charge i.e. commit45

ting an act prejudicial to good order and military discipline under section 63 of the Act and the third charge was
also in respect of offence under section 63 of the Act.

‘the appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges. The
General Court Martial on November 29, 1978 found him guilty
of first and third charge and awarded the sentence of dismissal from service. Thereupon the appellant submitted
petition dated December 18, 1978 to the Chief of Army Staf
praying that the findings of the General Court Martial be
not confirmed. The Chief of the Army Staff by his order
dated May 11, 1979 confirmed the findings and sentence o
the General Court Martial. The appellant thereafter submitted a post-confirmation petition under section 164(2) of the
Act. This was rejected by the Central Government by order
dated May 6, 1980. Thereupon the appellant filed a wri
petition in the High Court of Delhi which was dismissed in
limine. Hence this appeal by special leave directed to be
heard by the Constitution Bench for the reason that i
involves the question as to whether it was incumbent for the
Chief of the Army Staff, while confirming the findings and
sentence of the General Court Martial and for the Central
Government while rejecting the post-confirmation petition o
the appellant to record their reasons for the orders passed
by them.

Dismissing the appeal, this Court,

HELD: The requirement that reasons be recorded should
govern the decisions of an administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial functions irrespective of the fact whether the decision is subject to appeal, revision or judicial
review. It may, however, be added that it is not required
that the reasons should be as elaborate as in the decision

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

of a Court of law. The extent and nature of the reasons
would depend on particular facts and circumstances. What is
necessary is that the reasons are clear and explicit so as
to indicate that the authority has given due consideration
to the points in controversy. [62H; 63A-B]

The need for recording of reasons is greater in a case
where the order is passed at the original stage. The appellate or revisional authority, if it affirms such an order,
need not give separate reasons if the appellate or revisional authority agrees with the reasons contained in the order
under challenge. [63B]

Except in cases where the requirement has been dispensed
with expressly or by necessary implication, an administrative authority exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions is required to record' the reasons for its decision.
[65B]

46

The provisions contained in the Army Act, 1950 and
Army Rules, 1954 negative a requirement to give reasons for
its findings and sentence by a Court Martial and reasons are
not required to be recorded in cases where the Court Martial
makes a recommendation to mercy. Similarly, reasons are not
required to be recorded for an order passed by the confirming authority confirming the findings and sentence recorded
by the Court Martial as well as for the order passed by the
Central Government dismissing the post-confirmation petition. [70E-F]

Sub-section (1) of section 164 of the Army Act enables a
person aggrieved by an order passed by a Court Martial to
present a petition against the same. The expression "order"
under sub-section (1) does not include a finding or sentence
of the Court Martial and in so far as the finding and sentence of the Court Martial is concerned the only remedy that
is available to a person aggrieved by the same is under
sub-section (2) of section 164 of the Army Act and the said
remedy can be invoked only after the finding or sentence has
been confirmed by the confirming authority and not before
the confirmation of the same. [72B; D-E]

Though a person aggrieved by the finding or sentence of
a Court Martial has no right to make a representation before
the confirmation of the same by the confirming authority,
but in case such a representation is made by a person aggrieved by the finding or sentence of a Court Martial it is
expected that the confirming authority shall give due consideration to the same while confirming the finding and
sentence of the Court Martial. [72H; 73A]

passed by the High Court of Delhi dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant. In the writ
petition the appellant had challenged the validity of the finding and the sentence recorded by the
General Court Martial on November 29, 1978, the order dated May 11, 1979, passed by the Chief of
Army Staff confirming the findings and the sentence recorded by the General Court Martial and the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 4S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

order dated May 6, 1980, passed by the Central Government dismissing the petition filed by the
appellant under Section 164(2) of the Army Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act’).

The appellant held a permanent commission, as an offi- cer, in the regular army and was holding the
substantive rank of Captain. He was officiating as a Major. On December 27, 1974, the appellant
took over as the Officer Commanding of 38 Coy. ASC (Sup) Type 'A' attached to the Military
Hospital, Jhansi. In August 1975, the appellant had gone to attend a training course and he returned
in the first week of November 1975. In his absence Captain G.C. Chhabra was the officer
commanding the unit of the appellant. During this period Captain Chhabra submitted a Contingent
Bill dated September 25, 1975 for Rs.16,280 for winter liveries of the depot civilian chowkidars and
sweepers. The said Contingent Bill was returned by the Controller of Defence Accounts (CDA)
Meerut with certain objections. Thereupon the appellant submitted a fresh Contingent Bill dated
December 25, 1975 for a sum of Rs.7,029.57. In view of the difference in the amounts mentioned in
the two Contingent Bills, the CDA reported the matter to the headquarters for investiga- tion and a
Court of Enquiry blamed the appellant for certain lapses.

The said report of the Court of Enquiry was considered by the General Officer Commanding, M.P.,
Bihar and Orissa Area, who, on January 7, 1977 recommended that 'severe displeasure’ (to be
recorded) of the General Officer Com- manding-in-Chief of the Central Command be awarded to the
appellant. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief. Central Command did not agree with the said
opinion and by order dated August 26, 1977, directed that disciplinary action be taken against the
appellant for the lapses. In view of the aforesaid order passed by the General Officer
Commanding-in-Chief, Central Command, a charge sheet dated July 20. 1978, containing three
charges was served on the appellant and it was directed that he be tried by Gener- al Court Martial.
The first charge was in respect of the offence under Section 52(f) of the Act, i.e. doing a thing with
intent to defraud. the second charge was alternative to the first charge and was in respect of offence
under Section 63 of the Act, i.e. committing an act prejudicial to good order and military discipline
and the third charge was also in respect of offence under Section 63 of the Act. The appellant
pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecution examined 22 witnesses to prove the charges. The
General Court Martial. on November 29, 1978, found the appellant not guilty of the second charge
but found him guilty of the first and the third charge and awarded the sentence of dismissal from
service. The appellant submit
ted a petition dated December 18, 1978, to the Chief of Army Staff wherein he prayed that the
findings and the sentence of the General Court Martial be not confirmed. The findings and sentence
of the General Court Martial were confirmed by the Chief of the Army Staff by his order dated May
11, 1979. The appellant, thereafter, submitted a post-confirmation petition under Section 164(2) of
the Act. The said petition of the appellant was rejected by the Central Government by order dated
May 6, 1980. The appellant thereupon filed the writ petition in the High Court of Delhi. The said
writ petition was dismissed, in limine, by the High Court by order dated August 12, 1981. The
appellant approached this Court for grant of special leave to appeal against the said order of the
Delhi High Court. By order dated January 24, 1984, special leave to appeal was granted by this
Court. By the said order it was directed that the appeal be listed for final hearing before the
Constitution Bench. The said order does not indicate the reason why the appeal was directed to be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 5S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

heard by the Constitution Bench. The learned counsel for the appellant has stated that this direction
has been given by this Court for the reason that the appeal involves the question as to whether it was
incumbent for the Chief of the Army Staff, while confirming the findings and the sentence of the
General Court Martial, and for the Central Govern- ment, while rejecting the post-confirmation
petition of the appellant, to record their reasons for the orders passed by them. We propose to deal
with this question first. It may be mentioned that this question has been consid- ered by this Court
in Som Datt Datta v. Union of India and Others, [1969] 2 S.C.R. 177. In that case it was contended
before this Court that the order of the Chief of Army Staff confirming the proceedings of the Court
Martial under Sec- tion 164 of the Act was illegal since no reason had been given in support of the
order by the Chief of the Army Staff and that the Central Government had also not given any reason
while dismissing the appeal of the petitioner in that case under Section 165 of the Act and that the
order of the Central Government was also illegal. This contention was negatived. After referring to
the provisions contained in Sections 164, 165 and 162 of the Act this Court pointed that while
Section 162 of the Act expressly provides that the Chief of the Army Staff may "for reasons based on
the merits of the case" set aside the proceedings or reduce the sentence to any other sentence which
the Court might have passed, there is no express obligation imposed by Sections 164 and 165 of the
Act on the confirming authority or upon the Central Government to give reasons in support of its
decision to confirm the proceedings of the Court Martial. This Court observed that no other section
of the Act or any of the rules made therein had been brought to its notice from which necessary
implication can be drawn that such a duty is cast upon the Central Government or upon the
confirming authority. This Court did not accept the contention that apart from any requirement
imposed by the statute or statutory rule either expressly or by necessary implication, there is a
general principle or a rule of natural justice that a statutory tribunal should always and in every case
give reasons m support of its decision.

Shri A.K. Ganguli has urged that the decision of this Court in Som Datt Datta's case (supra) to the
extent it holds that there is no general principle or rule of natural justice that a statutory tribunal
should always and in every case give reasons in support of its decision needs reconsid- eration
inasmuch as it is not in consonance with the other decisions of this Court. In support of this
submission Shri Ganguli has placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in Bhagat Raja v. The
Union of India and Others, [1967] 3 SCR 302; Mahabir Prasad Santosh Kumar v. State of U.P. and
Others, [1971] 1 SCR 201; Woolcombers of India Ltd. v. Woolcombers Workers Union and Another,
[1974] 1 S.C.R. 503 and Siemens Engineering & Manufacturing Co. of India Limited v. Union of
India and Another, [1976] Suppl. S.C.R. 489. The learned Additional Solicitor General has refuted
the said submission of Shri Ganguli and has submitted that there is no requirement in law that
reasons be given by the con- firming authority while confirming the finding or sentence of the
Court-Martial or by the Central Government while dealing with the post-confirmation petition
submitted under Section 164 of the Act and that the decision of this Court in Som Datt Datta's case
(supra) in this regard does not call for reconsideration.

The question under consideration can be divided into two parts:

(i) Is there any general principle of law which requires an administrative authority to record the
reasons for its decision; and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 6S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

(ii) If so, does the said principle apply to an order con- firming the findings and sentence of a
Court-Martial and post-confirmation proceedings under the Act?

On the first part of the question there is divergence of opinion in the common law countries. The
legal position in the United States is different from that in other common law countries.

In the United States the courts have insisted upon recording of reasons for its decision by an
administrative authority on the premise that the authority should give clear indication that it has
exercised the discretion with which it has been empowered because "administrative process will best
be vindicated by clarity in its exercise" Phelps Dodge Corporation v. National Labour Relations
Board, [1940] 85 Law Edn. 1271 at P. 1284. The said requirement of record- ing of reasons has also
been justified on the basis that such a decision is subject to judicial review and "the Courts cannot
exercise their duty of review unless they are advised of the considerations underlying the action
under review" and that "the orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds
upon which the administra- tive agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sustained."
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corporation, [1942] 87 Law Ed. 626 at P. 636. In
John T. Dunlop v. Waiter Bachowski, [1975] 44 Law Ed. 2 377) it has been observed that a statement
of reasons serves purposes other than judicial review inasmuch as the reasons promotes thought by
the authority and compels it to cover the rele- vant points and eschew irrelevancies and assures
careful administrative consideration. The Federal Administrative Procedure Act, 1946 which
prescribed the basic procedural principles which are to govern formal administrative proce- dures
contained an express provision (Section g(b) ) to the effect that all decisions shall indicate a
statement of findings and conclusions as well as reasons or basis the, for upon all the material issues
of fact, law or discretion presented on the record. The said provision is now contained in Section
557(c) of Title 5 of the United States Code (1982 edition). Similar provision is contained in the state
stat- utes.

In England the position at Common law is that there is no requirement that reasons should be given
for its decision by the administrative authority (See: Regina v. Gaming Board for Great Britain Ex
Party Benaim and Khaida, [1970] 2 Q.B. 417 at p. 431 and McInnes v. Onslow-Fane and Another,
[1978] 1 W.L.R. 1520 at p. 1531). There are, however, observa- tions in some judgments wherein the
importance of reasons has been emphasised. In his dissenting judgment in Breen v. Amalgamated
Engineering Union and Others, [1971] 2 Q.B. 175 Lord Denning M.R., has observed that:

"the giving of reasons is one of the fundamental of good administration." (P. 191) In Alexander
Machinery (Dudley) Ltd. v. Crabtree, [1974] ICR 120 Sir John Donaldson, as President of the
National Industrial Relations Court, has observed that:

"failure to give reasons amounts to a denial of justice."

In Regina v. Immigration Appeal Tribunal Ex parte Khan (Mahmud), [1983] QB 790 Lord Lane, CJ.,
while expressing his reservation on the proposition that any failure to give reasons means a denial of
justice, has observed: "A party appearing before a tribunal is entitled to know either expressly stated

by the tribunal or inferentially stated, what it is to which the tribunal is addressing its mind." (P.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 7S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

794) The Committee on Ministers' Powers (Donoughmore Commit- tee) in its report submitted in
1932, recommended that "any party affected by a decision should be informed of the reasons on
which the decision is based" and that "such a decision should be in the form of a reasoned document
avail- able to the parties affected." (P. 100) The Committee on Administrative Tribunals and
Enquiries (Franks Committee) in its report submitted in 1957, recommended that "decisions of
tribunals should be reasoned and as full as possible." The said Committee has observed:

"Almost all witnesses have advocated the giving of reasoned decisions by tribunals. We are
convinced that if tribunal proceedings are to be fair to the citizen reasons should be given to the
fullest practicable extent. A decision is apt to be better if the reasons for it have to be set out in
writing because the reasons are then more likely to have been properly thought out. Further, a
reasoned decision is essential in order that, where there is a right of appeal, the applicant can assess
whether he has good grounds of appeal and know the case he will have to meet if he decides to
appeal." (Para 98) The recommendations of the Donoughmore Committee and the Franks
Committee led to the enactment of the Tribunals and Enquiries Act, 1958 in United Kingdom.
Section 12 of that Act prescribed that it shall be the duty of the Tribunal or Minister to furnish a
statement, either written or oral, of the reasons for the decision if requested, on or before the giving
of notification of the decision to support the deci- sion. The said Act has been replaced by the
Tribunals and Enquiries Act, 1971 which contains a similar provision in Section 12. This
requirement is. however, confined. in its applications to tribunals and statu
tory authorities specified in Schedule I to the said enact- ment. In respect of the tribunals and
authorities which are not covered by the aforesaid enactment, the position, as prevails at common
law, applies. The Committee of JUSTICE in its Report, Administration Under Law, submitted in
1971, has expressed the view:

"No single factor has inhibited the development of English administrative law as seriously as the
absence of any gener- al obligation upon public authorities to give reasons for their decisions."

The law in Canada appears to be the same as in England. In Pure Spring Co. Ltd. v. Minister of
National Revenue, [1947] 1 DLR 501 at P. 539 it was held that when a Minister makes a
determination in his discretion he is not required by law to give any reasons for such a
determination. In some recent decisions, however, the Courts have recognised that in certain
situations there would be an implied duty to state the reasons or grounds for a decision (See: Re R
D.R. Construction Ltd. And Rent Review Commission, [1983] 139 DLR (3d) 168) and Re Yarmouth
Housing Ltd. And Rent Review Commission, [1983] 139 DLR (3d) 544. In the Province of Ontario
the Statutory Powers Procedure Act, 1971 was enacted which provided that "a tribunal shall give its
final deci- sion, if any, in any proceedings in writing and shall give reasons in writing therefore if
requested by a party." (Section 17). The said Act has now been replaced by the Statutory Powers and
Procedure Act, 1980, which contains a similar provision.

The position at common law is no different in Australia. The Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court
of New South Wales in Osmond v. Public service Board of New South Wales, [1985] 3 NSWLR 447)

had held that the common law requires those entrusted by Statute with the discretionary power to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 8S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

make decisions which will affect other persons to act fairly in the performance of their statutory
functions and normally this will require an obligation to state the reasons for their decisions. The
said decision was overruled by the High Court of Australia in Public Service Board of New South
Wales v. Osmond, [1986] 63 ALR 559 and it has been held that there is no general rule of the
common law, or principle of natural justice, that requires reasons to be given for administrative
decisions, even decisions which have been made in the exercise of a statutory discretion and which
may adversely affect the interests or defeat the legitimate or reasonable expectations, of other
persons. Gibbs CJ., in his leading judgment, has expressed the view that "the 'rules of natural justice
are designed to ensure fairness in the making of a decision and it is difficult to see how the fairness
of an administrative decision can be affected by what is done after the decision has been made." The
learned Chief Justice has. however. observed that "even assuming that in special circumstances
natural justice may require reasons to be given, the present case is not such a case." (P. 568). Deane
J., gave a concur- ring judgment, wherein after stating that "the exercise of a decision making power
in a way which adversely affects others is less likely to be. or appear to be, arbitrary if the
decision-maker formulates and provides reasons for his decision", the learned Judge has proceeded
to hold that "the stage has not been reached in this country where it is a general prima facie
requirement of the common law rules of natural justice or procedural fair play that the administrative decision-maker. having extended to persons who might be adversely affected by a decision an
adequate opportunity of being heard. is bound to furnish reasons for the exercise of a statutory
decision-making power." (P. 572). The learned Judge has further observed that the common law
rules of natural justice or procedural fair play are neither stand- ardized nor immutable and that
their content may vary with changes in contemporary practice and standards. In view of the
statutory developments that have taken place in other countries to which reference was made by the
Court of Ap- peal, Deane, J. has observed that the said developments "are conducive to an
environment within which the courts should be less reluctant than they would have been in times
past to discern in statutory provisions a legislative intent that the particular decision-maker should
be under a duty to give reasons." (P. 573).

This position at common law has been altered by the Commonwealth Administrative Decisions
(Judicial Review) Act. 1977. Section 13 of the said Act enables a person who is entitled to apply for
review the decision before the Federal Court to request the decision-maker to furnish him with a
statement in writing setting out the findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence
or other mate- rial on which those findings were based and giving the reasons for the decision and
on such a request being made the decision-maker has to prepare the statement and furnish it to the
persons who made the request as soon as practica- ble and in any event within 28 days. The
provisions of this Act are not applicable to the classes of decisions mentioned in Schedule I to the
Act. A similar duty to give reasons has also been imposed by Sections 28 and 37 of the
commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. 1975. In India the matter was considered by
the Law Commission in the 14th Report relating to reform in Judicial Administra- tion. The Law
Commission recommended:

"In the case of administrative decisions provision should be made that they should be accompanied
by reasons. The reasons will make it possible to test the validity of these deci- sions by the

machinery of appropriate writs." (Vol. II P.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 9S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

694).

No laws has, however, been enacted in pursuance of these recommendations, imposing a general
duty to record the reasons for its decision by an administrative authority though the requirement to
give reasons is found in some statutes.

The question as to whether an administrative authority should record the reasons for its decision
has come up for consideration before this Court in a number of cases. In M/s. Harinagar Sugar Mills
Ltd. v. Shyam Sundar Jhunjhunwala and Others, [1962] 2 SCR 339, a Constitution Bench of this
Court. while dealing with an order passed by the Central Government in exercise of its appellate
powers under Section 111(3) of the Companies Act, 1956 in the matter of refusal by a company to
register the transfer of shares, has held that there was no proper trial of the appeals before the
Central Government since no reasons had been given in support of the order passed by the Deputy
Secretary who heard the appeals. In that case it has been observed:

"If the Central Government acts as a tribunal exercising judicial powers and the exercise of that
power is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution we fail to see
how the power of this Court can be effectively exercised if reasons are not given by the Central
Government in support of its order." (P. 357) In Madhya Pradesh Industries Ltd. v. Union of India
and Others, [1966] 1 S.C.R. 466 the order passed by the Central Government dismissing the revision
petition under Rule 55 of the Mineral Concession Roles, 1960, was challenged before this Court on
the ground that it did not contain reasons. Bachawat, J., speaking for himself and Mudholkar, J., rejected this contention on the view that the reason for rejecting the revision application appeared on
the face of the order because the Central Government had agreed with the reasons given by the State
Government in its order. The learned Judges did not agree with the submission that omission to
give reasons for the decision is of itself a sufficient ground for quash- ing it and held that for the
purpose of an appeal under Article 136 orders of courts and tribunals stand on the same footing. The
learned Judges pointed out that an order of court dismissing a revision application often gives no
reasons but this is not a sufficient ground for quashing it and likewise an order of an administrative
tribunal reject- ing a revision application cannot be pronounced to be in- valid on the sole ground
that it does not give reasons for the rejection. The decision in Hari Nagar Sugar Mills case (supra)
was distinguished on the ground that in that case the Central Government had reversed the decision
appealed against without giving any reasons and the record did not disclose any apparent ground for
the reversal. According to the learned Judges there is a vital difference between an order of reversal
and an order of affirmance. Subba Rao, J., as he then was, did to concur with this view and found
that the order of the Central Government was vitiated as it did not disclose any reasons for rejecting
the revision applica- tion. The learned Judge has observed:

"In the context of a welfare State, administrative tribunals have come to stay. Indeed, they are the
necessary concomi- tants of a Welfare State. But arbitrariness in their func- tioning destroys the
concept of a welfare State itself. Self-discipline and supervision exclude or at any rate minimize
arbitrariness. The least a tribunal can do is to disclose its mind. The compulsion of disclosure
guarantees consideration. The condition to give reasons introduces clarity and excludes or at any
rate minimizes arbitrariness; it gives satisfaction to the party against whom the order is made; and it

also enables an appellate or supervisory court to keep the tribunals within bounds, A reasoned order
is a desirable condition of judicial disposal." (P. 472). "If tribunals can make orders without giving
reasons, the said power in the hands of unscrupulous or dishonest officer may turn out to be a
potent weapon for abuse of power. But, if reasons for an order are given, it will be an effective
restraint on such abuse, as the order, if its discloses extraneous or irrelevant considerations, will be
subject to judicial scrutiny and correction. A speaking order will at its best be a reasonable and at its
worst be at least a plausible one. The public should not be deprived of this only safeguard." (P. 472).

"There is an essential distinction between a court and an administrative tribunal. A Judge is trained
to look at things objectively, uninfluenced by considerations of policy or expediency; but an
executive officer generally looks at things from the standpoint of policy and expediency. The habit of
mind of an executive officer so formed cannot be expected to change from function to function or
from act to act. So it is essential that some restrictions shall be imposed on tribunals in the matter of
passing orders affect- ing the rights of parties; and the least they should do is to give reasons for
their orders. Even in the case of appel- late courts invariably reasons are given, except when they
dismiss an appeal or revision in limine and that is because the appellate or revisional court agrees
with the reasoned judgment of the subordinate court or there are no legally permissible grounds to
interfere with it. But the same reasoning cannot apply to an appellate tribunal, for as often as not the
order of the first tribunal is laconic and does not give any reasons." (P. 472-73).

With reference to an order of affirmance the learned Judge observed that where the original tribunal
gives rea- sons, the appellate tribunal may dismiss the appeal or the revision, as the case may be,
agreeing with those reasons and that what is essential is that reasons shall be given by an appellate
or revisional tribunal expressly or by refer- ence to those given by the original tribunal. This matter
was considered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Bhagat Raja case (supra) where also the
order under challenge had been passed by the Central Government in exercise of its revisional
powers under Section 30 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 read
with rules 54 and 55 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. Dealing with the question as to whether
it was incum- bent on the Central Government to give any reasons for its decision on review this
Court has observed: "The decisions of tribunals in India are subject to the supervisory powers of the
High Courts under Art. 227 of the Constitution and of appellate powers of this Court under Art. 136.
It goes without saying that both the High Court and this Court are placed under a great disadvantage
if no reasons are given and the revision is dismissed curtly by the use of the single word "rejected",
or "dismissed". In such a case, this Court can probably only exercise its appeallate jurisdiction
satisfactorily by examining the entire records of the case and after giving a hearing come to its
conclusion on the merits of the appeal. This will certainly be a very unsatisfactory method of dealing
with the appeal." (P. 309).

This Court has referred to the decision in Madhya pra- desh Industries case (supra) and the
observations of Subba Rao, J., referred to above, in that decision have been quoted with approval.
After taking note of the observations of Bachawat, J., in that case, the learned Judges have held:
"After all a tribunal which exercises judicial or quasijudi- cial powers can certainly indicate its mind
as to why it acts in a particular way and when important rights of par- ties of far-reaching
consequences to them are adjudicated upon in a summary fashion, without giving a personal

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 11S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

hearing when proposals and counter proposals are made and examined, the least that can be
expected is that the tribunals shall tell the party why the decision is going against him in all cases
where the law gives a further right of appeal." (P.315).

Reference has already been made to Som Datt Datta's case (supra) wherein a Constitution Bench of
this Court has held that the confirming authority, while confirming the findings and sentence of a
Court-Martial, and the Central Government, while dealing with an appeal under Section 165 of the
Act, are not required to record the reasons for their decision and it has been observed that apart
from any requirement imposed by the statute or statutory rule either expressly or by necessary
implication, it could not be said that there is any general principle or any rule of natural justice that
a statutory tribunal should always and in every case give reasons in support of its decision. In that
case the Court was primarily concerned with the interpretation of the provisions of Act and the
Army Rules, 1954. There is no reference to the earlier decisions in Harinagar Sugar Mills case
(supra) and Bhagat Raja case (supra) wherein the duty to record reasons was imposed in view of the
appellate jurisdiction of this Court and the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles
136 and 227 of the Consti- tution of India respectively.

In Travancore Rayon Ltd. v. Union of India, [1970] 3 SCR 4(1 this Court has observed:

"The Court insists upon disclosure of reasons in support of the order on two grounds; one, that the
party aggrieved in a proceedings before the High Court or this Court has the opportunity to
demonstrate that the reasons which persuaded the authority to reject his case were erroneous; the
other, that the obligation to record reasons operates as a deter- rent against possible arbitrary action
by the executive authority invested with the judicial power." (P. 46) In Mahabir Prasad Santosh
Kumar v. State of U.P. and Others (supra) the District Magistrate had cancelled the licence granted
under the' U.P Sugar Dealers’ Licensing Order, 1962 without giving any reason and the State
Govern- ment had dismissed the appeal against the said order of the District Magistrate without
recording the reasons. This Court has held:

"The practice of the executive authority dismissing statuto- ry appeal against orders which prima
facie seriously preju- dice the rights of the aggrieved party without giving rea- sons is a negation of
the rule of law." (P. 204) "Recording of reasons in support of a decision on a disputed claim by a
quasi-judicial authority ensures that the deci- sion is reached according to law and is not the result
of caprice, whim or fancy or reached on grounds of policy or expediency. A party to the dispute is
ordinarily entitled to know the grounds on which the authority has rejected his claim. If the order is
subject to appeal, the necessity to record reasons is greater, for without recorded reasons the
appellate authority has no material on which it may deter- mine whether the facts were properly
ascertained, the rele- vant law was correctly applied and the decision was just." (P. 205) In
Woolcombers of India Ltd. case (supra) this Court was dealing with an award of an Industrial
Tribunal. It was found that the award stated only the conclusions and it did not give the supporting
reasons. This Court has observed: "The giving of reasons in support of their conclusions by judicial
and quasi-judicial authorities when exercising initial jurisdiction is essential for various reasons.
First, it is calculated to prevent unconscious unfairness or arbitrari
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 42S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

ness in reaching the conclusions. The very search for rea- sons will put the authority on the alert and
minimise the chances of unconscious infiltration of personal bias or unfairness in the conclusion.
The authority will adduce reasons which will be regarded as fair and legitimate by a reasonable man
and will discard irrelevant or extraneous considerations. Second, it is a well-known principle that
justice should not only be done but should also appear to be done. Unreasoned conclusions may be
just but they may not appear to be just to those who read them. Reasoned conclu- sions, on the other
hand, will have also the appearance of justice. Third, it should be remembered that an appeal
generally lies from the decision of judicial and quasi- judicial authorities to this Court by special
leave granted under Article 136. A judgment which does not disclose the reasons, will be of little
assistance to the Court." (P.

507) In Siemens Engineering & Manufacturing Co. of India Limited case (supra) this Court was
dealing with an appeal against the order of the Central Government on a revision applica- tion
under the Sea Customs Act, 1878. This Court has laid down:

"It is now settled law that where an authority makes an order in exercise of a quasi-judicial function
it must record its reasons in support of the order it makes. Every quasijudicial order must be
supported by reasons." (P 495) "If courts of law are to be replaced by administrative authorities and
tribunals, as indeed, in some kinds of cases, with the proliferation of Administrative Law they may
have to be so replaced, it is essential that administrative authorities and tribunals should accord fair
and proper hearing to the persons sought to be affected by their orders and give sufficiently clear
and explicit reasons in support of the orders made by them. Then along administrative au- thorities
and tribunals, exercising quasi-judicial function will be able to justify their existence and carry
credibili- ty with the people by inspiring confidence in the adjudica- tory process. The rule requiring
reasons to be given in support of an order is, like the principle of audi alteram partera, a basic
principle of natural justice which must inform every quasi-judicial process and this rule must be
observed in its proper spirit and mere pretence of compliance with it would not satisfy the
requirement of law." (496) Tarachand Khatri v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi & Others, [1977] 2
SCR 198 was a case where an inquiry was conducted into charges of misconduct and the disciplinary
authority, agreeing with the findings of the Inquiry Offi- cer, had imposed the penalty of dismissal.
The said order of dismissal was challenged on the ground that the disciplinary authority had not
given its reasons for passing the order. The said contention was negatived by this Court and distinction was drawn between an order of affirmance and an order of reversal. It was observed:

vee while it may be necessary for a disciplinary or administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial
functions to state the reasons in support of its order if it differs from the conclusions arrived at and
the recommendations made by the Inquiry Officer in view of the scheme of a particular enactment
or the rules made thereunder, it would be laying down the proposition too broadly to say that even
an ordi- nary concurrence must be supported by reasons." (P. 208) In Raipur Development
Authority and Others v. Mls. Chokhamal Contractors and Others, [1989] 2 S.C.C. 721 a Constitution
Bench of this Court was considering the ques- tion whether it is obligatory for an arbitrator under
the Arbitration Act, 194(1 to give reasons for the award. It was argued that the requirement of giving
reasons for the deci- sion is a part of the rules of natural justice which are also applicable to the
award of an arbitrator and reliance was placed on the decisions in Bhagat Raja case (Supra) and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 13S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

Siemens Engineering Co. case (Supra). The said contention was rejected by this Court. After
referring to the decisions in Bhagat Raja case (Supra); Som Datt Datta case (Supra) and Siemens
Engineering Co. case (Supra) this Court has ob- served:

"It is no doubt true that in the decisions pertaining to Administrative Law, this court in some cases
has observed that the giving of reasons in an administrative decision is a rule of natural justice by an
extension of the prevailing rules. It would be in the interest of the world of commerce that the said
rule is confined to the area of Administrative Law ..... But at the same time it has to be borne in
mind that what applies generally to settlement of disputes by authorities governed by public law
need not be extended to all cases arising under private law such as those arising under the law of
arbitration which is intended for settle- ment of private disputes." (P. 751-52) The decisions of this
Court referred to above indicate that with regard to the requirement to record reasons the approach
of this Court is more in line with that of the American Courts. An important consideration which has
weighed with the Court for holding that an administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial
functions must record the reasons for its decision, is that such a decision is subject to the appellate
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution as well as the supervisory jurisdiction
of the High Courts under Article 227 of the Constitution and that the reasons, if recorded, would
enable this Court or the High Courts to effectively exercise the appellate or supervisory power. But
this is not the sole consideration. The other considerations which have also weighed with the Court
in taking this view are that the requirement of recording reasons would (i) guarantee consid- eration
by the authority; (ii) introduce clarity in the decisions; and (iii) minimise chances of arbitrariness in
decisionmaking. In this regard a distinction has been drawn between ordinary Courts of law and
tribunals and authorities exercising judicial functions on the ground that a Judge is trained to look
at things objectively uninfluenced by con- siderations of policy or expediency whereas an executive
officer generally looks at things from the standpoint of policy and expediency.

Reasons, when recorded by an administrative authority in an order passed by it while exercising
quasi-judicial func- tions, would no doubt facilitate the exercise of its juris- diction by the appellate
or supervisory authority. But the other considerations, referred to above, which have also weighed
with this Court in holding that an administrative authority must record reasons for its decision, are
of no less significance. These considerations show that the re- cording of reasons by an
administrative authority serves a salutary purpose, namely, it excludes chances of arbitrari- ness
and ensures a degree of fairness in the process of decision-making. The said purpose would apply
equally to all decisions and its application cannot be confined to deci- sions which are subject to
appeal, revision or judicial review. In our opinion, therefore, the requirement that reasons be
recorded should govern the decisions of an admin- istrative authority exercising quasijudicial
functions irrespective of the fact whether the decision is subject to appeal, revision or judicial
review. It may, however, be added that it is not required that the reasons should be as elabo- rate as
in the decision of a Court of law. The extent and nature of the reasons would depend on particular
facts and circumstances. What is necessary is that the reasons are clear and explicit so as to indicate
that the authority has given due consideration to the points in controversy. The need for recording
of reasons is greater in a case where the order is passed at the original stage. The appellate or
revisional authority, if it affirms such an order, need not give separate reasons if the appellate or
revisional author- ity agrees with the reasons contained in the order under challenge.

Having considered the rationale for the requirement to record the reasons for the decision of an
administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial functions we may now examine the legal basis for
imposing this obligation. While considering this aspect the Donough more Committee observed that
it may well be argued that there is a third principle of natural justice, namely, that a party is entitled
to know the reason for the decision, be it judicial or quasi-judi- cial. The committee expressed the
opinion that "there are some cases where the refusal to give grounds for a decision may be plainly
unfair; and this may be so, even when the decision is final and no further proceedings are open to
the disappointed party by way of appeal or otherwise" and that "where further proceedings are open
to a disappointed party, it is contrary to natural justice that the silence of the Minister or the
Ministerial Tribunal should deprive them of the opportunity." (P 80) Prof. H.W.R. Wade has also
ex- pressed the view that "natural justice may provide the best rubric for it, since the giving of
reasons is required by the ordinary man's sense of justice." (See Wade, Administra- tive Law, 6th
Edn. P. 548). In Siemens Engineering Co. case (Supra) this Court has taken the same view when it
observed that "the rule requiring reasons to be given in support of an order is, like the principles of
audi alteram parlem, a basic principle of natural justice which must inform every quasi-judicial
process." This decision proceeds on the basis that the two well-known principles of natural justice,
namely (i) that no man should be a Judge in his own cause and (ii) that no person should be judged
without a hearing, are not exhaustive and that in addition to these two princi- ples there may be
rules which seek to ensure fairness in the process of decision-making and can be regarded as part of
the principles of natural justice. This view is in conso- nance with the law laid down by this Court in
A.K. Kraipak and Others v. Union of India and Others, [1970] 1 SCR 457, wherein it has been held:

"The concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of change in recent years. In the past it
was thought that it included just two rules namely (i) no one shall be a Judge in his own cause
(nemo dabet esse judex propria causa) and (ii) no decision shall be given against a party without
affording him a reasonable hearing (audi alteram partem). Very soon thereafter a third rule was
envisaged and that is that quasi-judicial enquiries must be held in good faith, without bias and not
arbitrarily or unreasonably. But in the course of years many more subsidiary rules came to be added
to the rules of natural justice." (P. 468-69) A similar trend is discernible m the decisions of Eng- lish
Courts wherein it has been held that natural justice demands that the decision should be based on
some evidence of probative value. (See: R. v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner ex P. Moore,
[1965] 1 Q.B. 456; Mahon v. Air New Zealand Ltd., [1984] A.C. 648.

The object underlying the rules of natural justice "is to prevent miscarriage of justice” and secure
"fairplay in action." As pointed out earlier the requirement about re- cording of reasons for its
decision by an administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial functions achieves this object by
excluding chances of arbitrariness and ensuring a degree of fairness in the process of
decision-making. Keep- ing in view the expanding horizon of the principles of natural justice, we are
of the opinion, that the requirement to record reason can be regarded as one of the principles of
natural justice which govern exercise of power by adminis- trative authorities. The rules of natural
justice are not embodied rules. The extent of their application depends upon the particular statutory
framework whereunder jurisdiction has been conferred on the administrative authority. With regard
to the exercise of a particular power by an adminis- trative authority including exercise of judicial or
quasi- judicial functions the legislature, while conferring the said power, may feel that it would not

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 15S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

be in the larger public interest that the reasons for the order passed by the administrative authority
be recorded in the order and be communicated to the aggrieved party and it may dispense with such
a requirement. It may do so by making an express provi- sion to that affect as those contained in the
Administrative Procedure Act, 1946 of U.S.A. and the Administrative Deci- sions (Judicial Review)
Act, 1977 of Australia whereby the orders passed by certain specified authorities are excluded from
the ambit of the enactment. Such an exclusion can also arise by necessary implication from the
nature of the sub- ject matter, the scheme and the provisions of the enactment. The public interest
underlying such a provision would outweight the salutary purpose served by the require- ment to
record the reasons. The said requirement cannot, therefore, be insisted upon in such a case.

For the reasons aforesaid, it must be concluded that except in cases where the requirement has been
dispensed with expressly or by necessary implication, an administra- tive authority exercising
judicial or quasi-judicial func- tions is required to record the reasons for its decision. We may now
come to the second part of the question, namely, whether the confirming authority is required to
record its reasons for confirming the finding and sentence of the court-martial and the Central
Government or the competent authority entitled to deal with the post-confirma- tion petition is
required to record its reasons for the order passed by it on such petition. For that purpose it will be
necessary to determine whether the Act or the Army Rules, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Rules’) ex- pressly or by necessary implication dispense with the re- quirement of recording reasons.
We propose to consider this aspect in a broader perspective to include the findings and sentence of
the court-martial and examine whether reasons are required to be recorded at the stage of (i)
recording of findings and sentence by the court-martial; (ii) confirma- tion of the findings and
sentence of the court-martial; and

(iii) consideration of post-confirmation petition. Before referring to the relevant provisions of the
Act and the Rules it may be mentioned that the Constitution contains certain special provisions in
regard to members of the Armed Forces. Article 33 empowers Parliament to make law determining
the extent to which any of the rights conferred by Part Ill shall, in their application to the members
of the Armed Forces be restricted or abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties
and the maintenance of discipline amongst them. By clause (2) of Article 136 the appellate
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution has been excluded in relation to any
judg- ment, determination, sentence or order passed or made by any Court or tribunal constituted
by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces. Similarly clause (4) of Article 227 denies to the
High Courts the power of superintendence over any Court or tribunal constituted by or under any
law relat- ing to the Armed Forces. This Court under Article 32 and the High Courts under Article
226 have, however, the power of judicial review in respect of proceedings of courts-martial and the
proceedings subsequent thereto and can grant appropriate relief if the said pro- ceedings have
resulted in denial of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution or if the
said proceedings suffer from a jurisdictional error or any error of law apparent on the face of the
record.

Reference may now be made to the provisions of the Act and the Rules which have a bearing on the
requirement to record reasons for the findings and sentence of the court- martial. Section 108 of the

Act makes provision for four kinds of courts-martial, namely, (a) general courts-martial;

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 16S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

(b) district courts-martial; (c) summary general courtsmar- tial and (d) summary courts-martial.
The procedure of court- martial is prescribed in Chapter XI (Sections 128 to 152) of the Act. Section
129 prescribes that every general court- martial shall, and every district or summary general courtmartial, may be attended by a judge-advocate, who shall be either an officer belonging to the
department of the Judge- Advocate General, or if no such officer is available, an officer approved of
by the Judge-Advocate General or any of his deputies. In sub-section (1) of Section 131 it is provided that subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3) every decision of a courtmartial shall
be passed by an absolute majority of votes, and where there is an equality of votes on either the
finding or the sentence, the decision shall be in favour of the accused. In sub-section (2) it is laid
down that no sentence of death shall be passed by a general courtmartial without the concurrence of
at least two-thirds of the members of the court and sub-section (3) provides that no sentence of
death shall be passed by a summary general court-martial without the concurrence of all the
members. With regard to the procedure at trial before the General and District courts-martial
further provisions are made in Rules 37 to 105 of the Rules. In Rule 60 it is provided that the
judge-advocate (if any) shall sum up in open court the evidence and advise the court upon the law
relating to the case and that after the summing up of the judge-advocate no other address shall be
allowed. Rule 61 prescribes that the Court shall deliberate on its findings in closed court in the
presence of the judge-advocate and the opinion of each member of the court as to the finding shall
be given by word of mouth on each charge separately. Rule 62 prescribes the form, record and
announcement of finding and in sub-rule (1) it is provided that the finding on every charge upon
which the accused is arraigned shall be recorded and, except as provided in these rules, shall be
recorded simply as a finding of "Guilty" or of "Not guilty". Sub-rule (10) of Rule 62 lays down that
the finding on charge shall be announced forthwith in open court as subject to confirmation. Rule 64
lays down that in cases where the finding on any charge is guilty, the court, before deliberating on its
sentence, shall, whenever possible take evidence in the matters specified in sub-rule (1) and
thereafter the accused has a right to address the court thereon and in mitigation of punishment.
Rule 65 makes provision for sentence and provides that the court shall award a single sentence in
respect of all the offences of which the accused is found guilty, and such sentence shall be deemed to
be awarded in respect of the offence in each charge and in respect of which it can be legally given,
and not to be awarded in respect of any offence in a charge in respect of which it cannot be legally
given. Rule 66 makes provisions for recommendation to mercy and sub-rule (1) prescribes that if the
court makes a recommendation to mercy, it shall give its reasons for its reeommendation. Sub-rule
(1) of Rule 67 lays down that the sentence together with any recommendation to mercy and the
reasons for any such recommendation will be announced forthwith in open court. The powers and
duties of judge-advocate are pre- scribed in Rule 105 which, among other things, lays down that at
the conclusion of the case he shall sum up the evidence and give his opinion upon the legal bearing
of the case before the court proceeds to deliberate upon its find- ing and the court, in following the
opinion of the judge- advocate on a legal point may record that it has decided in consequences of
that opinion. The said rule also prescribes that the judge-advocate has, equally with the presiding
officer, the duty of taking care that the accused does not suffer any disadvantage in consequences of
his position as such, or of his ignorance or incapacity to examine or cross-examine witnesses or
otherwise, and may, for that purpose, with the permission of the court, call witnesses and put
questions to witnesses, which appear to him neces- sary or desirable to elicit the truth. It is further
laid down that in fulfilling his duties, the judgeadvocate must be careful to maintain an entirely

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 17S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

impartial position. From the provisions referred to above it is evident that the judge-advocate plays
an important role during the courts of trial at a general court-martial and he is enjoined to maintain
an impartial position. The court-martial records its findings after the judge-advocate has summed
up the evidence and has given his opinion upon the legal bearing of the case. The members of the
court have to express their opinion as to the finding by word of mouth on each charge separately and
the finding on each charge is to be recorded simply as a finding of "guilty" or of "not guilty". It is also
required that the sentence should be announced forth- with in open court. Moreover Rule 66(1)
requires reasons to be recorded for its recommendation in cases where the court makes a
recommendation to mercy. There is no such require
ment in other provisions relating to recording of findings and sentence. Rule 66(1) proceeds on the
basis that there is no such requirement because if such a requirement was there it would not have
been necessary to have a specific provi- sion for recording of reasons for the recommendation to
mercy. The said provisions thus negative a requirement to give reasons for its finding and sentence
by the court- martial and reasons are required to be recorded only in cases where the courtmartial
makes a recommendation to mercy. In our opinion, therefore, at the stage of recording of findings
and sentence the court-martial is not required to record its reasons and at that stage reasons are
only required for the recommendation to mercy if the court-mar- tial makes such a
recommendation.

As regards confirmation of the findings and sentence of the court-martial it may be mentioned that
Section 153 of the Act lays down that no finding or sentence of a General, District or summary
General, Court-Martial shall be valid except so far as it may be confirmed as provided by the Act.
Section 158 lays down that the confirming authority may while confirming the sentence of a
court-martial mitigate or remit the punishment thereby awarded, or commute that pun- ishment to
any punishment lower in the scale laid down in Section 71. Section 160 empowers the confirming
authority to revise the finding or sentence of the court-martial and in sub-section (1) of Section 160
it is provided that on such revision, the court, if so directed by the confirming au- thority, may take
additional evidence. The confirmation of the finding and sentence is not required in respect of
summary court-martial and in Section 162 it is provided that the proceedings of every summary
court-martial shall Without delay be forwarded to the officer commanding the division or brigade
within which the trial was held or to the prescribed officer; and such officer or the Chief of the Army
Staff or any officer empowered in this behalf may, for reasons based on the merits of the case, but
not any merely technical grounds, set aside the proceedings or reduce the sentence to any other
sentence which the court might have passed. In Rule 69 it is provided that the proceedings of a
general court-martial shall be submitted by the judge-advocate at the trial for review to the deputy
or assistant judge-advocate general of the command who shall then forward it to the confirming
officer and in case of district court- martial it is provided that the proceedings should be sent by the
presiding officer, who must, in all cases. where the sentence is dismissal or above, seek advice of the
deputy or assistant judge-advocate general of the command before confirmation. Rule 70 lays down
that upon receiving the proceedings of a general or district Court-Martial, the confirming authority
may confirm or refuse confirmation or reserve confirmation for superior authority, and the
confirmation, non-confirmation, or reservation shall be entered in and form part of the proceedings.
Rule 71 lays down that the charge, finding and sentence, and any recommendation to mercy shall,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 18S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

together with the confirmation or non-confirmation of the proceed- ings, be promulgated in such
manner as the confirming au- thority may direct, and if no direction is given, according to custom of
the service and until promulgation has been effected, confirmation is not complete and the finding
and sentence shall not be held to have been confirmed until they have been promulgated.

The provisions mentioned above show that confirmation of the findings and sentence of the
court-martial is necessary before the said finding or sentence become operative. In other words the
confirmation of the findings and sentence is an integral part of the proceedings of a court-martial
and before the findings and sentence of a court-martial are confirmed the same are examined by the
deputy or assistant judge-advocate general of the command which is intended as a check on the
legality and propriety of the proceedings as well as the findings and sentence of the court-martial.
Moreover we find that in Section 162 an express provision has been made for recording of reasons
based on merits of the case in relation to the proceedings of the summary courtmartial in cases
where the said proceedings are set aside or the sentence is reduced and no other requirement for
recording of reasons is laid down either in the Act or in the Rules in respect of proceedings for
confirmation. The only inference that can be drawn from Section 162 is that reasons have to be
recorded only in cases where the proceed- ings of a summary court-martial are set aside or the sentence is reduced and not when the findings and sentence are confirmed. Section 162 thus negatives a
requirement to give reasons on the part of the confirming authority while con- firming the findings
and sentence of a court-martial and it must be held that the confirming authority is not required to
record reasons while confirming the findings and sentence of the courtmartial.

With regard to post-confirmation proceedings we find that subsection (2) of Section 164 of the Act
provides that any person subject to the Act who considers himself ag- grieved by a finding or
sentence of any court-martial which has been confirmed, may present a petition to the Central
Government, the Chief of the Army Staff or any prescribed officer superior in command to the one
who confirmed such finding or sentence and the Central Government, the Chief of the Army Staff or
other officer, as the case may be, may pass such orders thereon as it or he thinks fit. In so far as the
findings and sentence of a court-martial and the proceedings for confirmation of such findings and
sentence are concerned it has been found that the scheme of the Act and the Rules is such that
reasons are not required to be recorded for the same. Has the legislature made a departure from the
said scheme in respect of post-confirmation proceedings? There is nothing in the language of
sub-section (2) of Section 164 which may lend support to such an intention. Nor is there anything in
the nature of post confirmation proceedings which may require recording of reasons for an order
passed on the post-confirmation petition even though reasons are not required to be recorded at the
stage of recording of findings and sentence by a court-martial and at the stage of confirmation of the
findings and sentence of the court- martial by the confirming authority. With regard to record- ing
of reasons the considerations which apply at the stage of recording of findings and sentence by the
court-martial and at the stage of confirmation of findings and sentence of the courtmartial by the
confirming authority are equally applicable at the stage of consideration of the post-confir- mation
petition. Since reasons are not required to be re- corded at the first two stages referred to above, the
said requirement cannot, in our opinion, be insisted upon at the stage of consideration of
post-confirmation petition under Section 164(2) of the Act.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 19S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

For the reasons aforesaid it must be held that reasons are not required to be recorded for an order
passed by the confirming authority confirming the findings and sentence recorded by the
court-martial as well as for the order passed by the Central Government dismissing the post-confirmation petition. Since we have arrived at the same conclu- sion as in Sorn Datt Datta case (Supra)
the submission of Shri Ganguli that the said decision needs reconsideration cannot be accepted and
is. therefore, rejected. But that is not the end of the matter because even though there is no
requirement to record reasons by the confirming authority while passing the order confirming the
findings and sentence of the CourtMartial or by the Central Government while passing its order on
the post-confirmation petition, it is open to the person aggrieved by such an order to challenge the
validity of the same before this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution or before the High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution and he can obtain appropriate relief in those proceedings. We
will, therefore, examine the other contentions that have been urged by Shri Ganguli in support of the
appeal. The first contention that has been urged by Shri Ganguli in this regard is that under
sub-section (1) of Section 164 of the Act the appellant had a right to make a representa- tion to the
confirming authority before the confirmation of the findings and sentence recorded by the
court-martial and that the said right was denied inasmuch as the appellant was not supplied with
the copies of the relevant record of the court-martial to enable him to make a complete representation and further that the representation submitted by the appellant under sub-section (1) of Section
164 was not considered by the confirming authority before it passed the order dated May 11, 1979
confirming the findings and sen- tence of the court-martial. The learned Additional Solicitor
General, on the other hand, has urged that under sub-section (1) of Section 164 no right has been
conferred on a person aggrieved by the findings or sentence of a court-martial to make a
representation to the confirming authority before the confirmation of the said findings or sentence.
The submis- sion of learned Additional Solicitor General is that while sub-section (1) of Section 164
refers to an order passed by a court-martial, sub-section (2) of Section 164 deals with the findings or
sentence of a court-martial and that the only right that has been conferred on a person aggrieved by
the finding or sentence of a court-martial is that under sub-section (2) of Section 164 and the said
right is avail- able after the finding and sentence has been confirmed by the confirming authority.
We find considerable force in the aforesaid submission of learned Additional Solicitor Gener- al.

Section 164 of the Act provides as under:

"(1) Any person subject to this Act who considers himself aggrieved by any order passed by any
court-martial may present a petition to the officer or authority empowered to confirm any tinging or
sentence of such court-martial and the confirming authority may take such steps as may be
considered necessary to satisfy itself as to the correct- ness. legality or propriety of the order passed
or as to the regularity of any proceeding to which the order relates. (2) Any person subject to this Act
who considers himself aggrieved by a finding or sentence of any court-martial which has been
confirmed, may present a petition to the Central Government, the Chief of the Army Staff or any
prescribed officer superior in command to the one who confirmed such finding or sentence and the
Central Govern- ment, the Chief of the Army Staff or other officer, as the case may be, may pass such
orders thereon as it or he thinks fit.”

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 20S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

In sub-section (1) reference is made to orders passed by a courtmartial and enables a person
aggrieved by an order to present a petition against the same. The said petition has to be presented to
the officer or the authority empowered to confirm any finding or sentence of such court-martial and
the said authority may take such steps as may be considered necessary to satisfy itself as to the
correctness, legality or propriety of the order or as to the regularity of any proceedings to which the
order relates. Sub-section (2), on the other hand, makes specific reference to finding or sentence of a
court-martial. and confers a right on any person feeling aggrieved by a finding or sentence of any
court-martial which has been confirmed, to present a peti- tion to the Central Government, Chief of
the Army Staff or any prescribed officer. The use of the expression "order" in sub-section (1) and the
expression "finding or sentence" in sub-section (2) indicates that the scope of sub-section (1) and
sub-section (2) is not the same and the expression "order" in sub-section (1) cannot be construed to
include a "finding or sentence". In other words in so far as the finding and sentence of the
court-martial is concerned the only remedy that is available to a person aggrieved by the same is
under sub-section (2) and the said remedy can be invoked only after the finding or sentence has
been con- firmed by the confirming authority and not before the con- firmation of the same. Rule
147 of the Rules also lends support to this view. In the said Rule it is laid down that every person
tried by a court-martial shall be entitled on demand, at any time after the confirmation of the
finding and sentence, when such confirmation is required, and before the proceedings are
destroyed, to obtain from the officer or person having the custody of the proceeding a copy thereof
including the proceedings upon revision, if any. This Rule envisages that the copies of proceedings
of a court-martial are to be supplied only after confirmation of the finding and sentence and that
there is no right to obtain the copies of the proceedings till the finding and sentence have been
confirmed. This means that the appellant cannot make a grievance about non-supply of the copies of
the proceedings of the court-martial and consequent denial of his right to make a representation to
the confirming authority against the findings and sentence of the court-martial before the
confirmation of the said finding and sentence. Though a person aggrieved by the finding or sentence
of a courtmar- tial has no right to make a representation before the confi- ramtion Of the same by
the confirming authority, but in case such a representation is made by a person aggrieved by the
finding or sentence of a court-martial it is expected that the confirming authority shall give due
consideration to the same while confirming the finding and sentence of the court-martial.

In the present case the representation dated December 18, 1978 submitted by the appellant to the
confirming au- thority was not considered by the confirming authority when it passed the order of
confirmation dated May 11, 1979. According to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of Union of India
this was due to the reason that the said represen- tation had not been received by the confirming
authority till the passing of the order of confirmation. It appears that due to some communication
gap within the department the representation submitted by the appellant did not reach the
confirming authority till the passing of the order of con- firmation. Since we have held that the
appellant had no legal right to make a representation at that stage the non- consideration of the
same by the confirming authority before the passing of the order of confirmation would not vitiate
the said order.

Shri Ganguli next contended that the first and the second charge levelled against the appellant are
identical in nature and since the appellant was acquitted of the second charge by the court-martial

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/400596/ 21S.N. Mukherjee vs Union Of India on 28 August, 1990

his conviction for the first charge can not be sustained. It is no doubt true that the allegations
contained in the first and the second charge are practically the same. But as mentioned earlier, the
second charge was by way of alternative to the first charge. The appellant could be held guilty of
either of these charges and he could not be held guilty of both the charges at the same time. Since
the appellant had been found guilty of the first charge he was acquitted of the second charge. There
is, therefore, no infirmity in the court-martial having found the appellant guilty of the first charge
while holding him not guilty of the second charge. Shri Ganguli has also urged that the findings
recorded by the court-martial on the first and third charges are perverse inasmuch as there is no
evidence to establish these charges. We find no substance in this contention. The first charge was
that the appellant on or about December 1975, having received 60.61 meters woollen serge from M/s
Ram Chandra & Brothers, Sadar Bazar, Jhansi for stitching 19 coats and pants for Class IV civilian
employees of his unit with intent to defraud got 19 altered ordnance pattern woollen pants issued to
the said civilian employees instead of pants stitched out of the cloth received. To prove this charge
the prosecution exam- ined Ram Chander P.W. 1 and Triloki Nath P.W. 2 of M/s Ram Chandra &
Brothers, Sadar Bazar, Jhansi who have deposed that 60.61 meters of woollen serge cloth was
delivered by them to the appellant in his office in December, 1975. The evidence of these witnesses is
corroborated by B.D. Joshi, Chowkidar, P.W. 3, who has deposed that in the last week of December,
1975, the appellant had told him in his office that cloth for their liveries had been received and they
should give their measurements. As regards the alteration of 19 ordnance pattern woollen pants
which were issued to the civilian employees instead of the pants stitched out of the cloth that was
received, there is the evidence of N/sub. P. Vishwambharam P.W. 19 who has deposed that he was
called by the appellant to his office in the last week of December, 1975 or the first week of January,
1976 and that on reaching there he found ordnance pattern woolien pants lying by the side of the
room wall next to the appellant's table and that the appellant had called Mohd. Sharif P.W. 15 to his
office and had asked him to take out 19 woolien trousers out of the lot kept there in the office. After
Mohd. Sharif had select- ed 19 woollen trousers the appellant told Mohd. Sharif to take away these
pants for alteration and refitting. The judge-advocate, in his summing up, before the court-martial,
has referred to this evidence on the first charge and the court-martial, in holding the appellant guilty
of the first charge, has acted upon it. It cannot, therefore, be said that there is no evidence to
establish the first charge levelled against the appellant and the findings recorded by the
court-martial in respect of the said charge is based on no evidence or is perverse.

The third charge, is that the appellant having come to know that Capt. Gian Chand Chhabra while
officiating OC of his unit, improperly submitted wrong Contingent Bill No. 341/Q dated September
25, 1975 for Rs.16,280 omitted to initiate action against Capt. Chhabra.

In his summing up before the court-martial the judge- advocate referred to the CDA letter M/IV/191
dated November 20, 1975 (Exh. 'CC’) raising cert in objection with regard to Contingent Bill No.
341/Q dated September 25, 1975 for Rs.16,280 and pointed out that the said letter was received in
the unit on or about November 28, 1975 and bears the initials of the appellant with the aforesaid
date and remark "Q Spk with details". This would show that the appellant had knowledge of the
Contingent Bill on November 28, 1975. It is not the case of the appellant that he made any complaint
against Captain Chhabra thereafter. It cannot, therefore, be said that the finding recorded by the
court-martial on the third charge is based on no evidence and is perverse.

In the result we find no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed. But in the
circumstances there will be no order as to costs.

HEADNOTE:

The second respondent, a partnership firm was carrying on
the business of manufacturing and selling polished granites.
It was running its factory in a small portion of the land
owned by it and the rest of the land was vacant when the
Urban Land (Ceiling & Regulation) Act, 1976 was made
applicable to that area. The firm made an application to.
the State Government for exemption of the vacant land from
the provisions of 715

716

the said Act, and the exemption was granted subject to
certain conditions.

The Competent Authority under the Act came to the conclusion
that there was some excess vacant land and directed the
publication of a notification u/s 10(1) of the Act for
acquisition of the same. Later, the firm made an
application to the State Government for permission to sell
the vacant land to the third respondent (builders) mainly on
the ground that the firm had been incurring huge losses in
its business. On 6.3.1987 the State Government permitted
the firm to sell the land to the builders, only to the
extent of 16194 sq. mtrs. Again the firm riled another
application to transfer the remaining 3444 sq. mtrs. of land
to the builders, and on 18.4.1987 the State Government
permitted the same subject to certain conditions.
Consequently, by a sale deed dated 30.9.1987 the firm
entered into a deed of absolute sale with the builders for
sale of the entire vacant land.

Writ Petitions by way of Public Interest Litigation were
riled in the High Court challenging the exemptions granted
by the State Government, for declaring the sale deed void
and inoperative and for acquiring the land for the weaker
sections. A Single Judge allowed the Writ Petitions and
gave certain directions including sale of plots to be carved
out from the land and only such number of plots as would be
necessary to discharge the debts of the firm were to be sold
and the remaining portion of the vacant land was to be
acquired under the Act. He also held that there were no
mala fides in the State Government granting exemptions by
its orders date 63.1987and 18.4.1987.

Against the decision of the Single Judge, appeals were
preferred before the Division Bench of the High Court and
the Division Bench set aside the findings as well as _ the
direction given by the Single Judge. Aggrieved by the
Judgment of the Division Bench, the appellants preferred the
present appeals.

Allowing the appeals, this Court,

HELD:
BY THE COURT.
I.I.The provisions of Section 20(1)(b) of the Urban Land

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 do not permit the State
Government to give exemption to the vacant land in excess of
the ceiling limit for the purposes

717

of transferring the same. [757 C]

1.2.The orders dated 63.1987 and 18.4.1987 granting
exemption and permission to the firm for sale of the land
are void ab initio having been passed without jurisdiction.
Accordingly, the sale-deed dated 30.9.1987 executed by the
2nd respondent-firm in favour of the 3rd respondent.
builders is invalid and inoperative, as the respondent-firm
had no legal right to transfer the land in favour of the
builders. [757 F, G]

13.In view of the above conclusions, it is not necessary
to go into the questionsas to whether the State Government
has the power to grant exemption; thecircumstances in
which it can be exercised; and whether financial hardship
such as the indebtedness of the land-holder is sufficient to
warrant such exemption or not; and the date on which such
indebtedness is to be assessed and in what manner; and
whether in the present case, the said aspects of the
indebtedness were properly investigated or not for this very
reason, there is no need to go into the other question
regarding the mala fide on the part of the authorities while
granting permission to the firm to sell the land to the
builders in question. [757 D, E]

Per Sawant, J.

1.The provisions of Section 20(1)(b) of the Urban Land
(Ceiling & Regulation) Act, 1976 do not permit the State
Government to exempt vacant land in excess of the ceiling
limit for the purposes of transfer. [753 B]

2.The central object of the Act, as is evident both from the
preamble as well as the statement of objects and reasons, is
to acquire vacant land in excess of the ceiling area and to
prevent speculation and profiteering in the same and also to
distribute the land equitably to subserve the common good.
It is, therefore, per se against the said object to permit
the sale of the excess vacant land for whatever reasons,
including the undue hardship of the land-holder. To
construe the provisions of Section 20 (1) (b) so as to read
in them the conferment of such power on the State Government
for whatever reasons, is to distort and defeat the whole
purpose of the legislation. Further, neither the plain
language of the clause nor its context and intendment merit
such construction. Section 20 itself is titled "Power to
exempt". The power given to the State Government under the
Section is only to exempt certain excess vacant lands from
the operation of the provisions of Sections 3 to 19 of
Chapter 111, none of which refers to the subject of transfer
or

718

restrictions on transfer. Those provisions relate to the
calculation. declaration, acquisition and vesting of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

excess vacant land. It is Chapter IV which relates to the
transfers of vacant lands and the restrictions thereon.
Further, from the scheme of the Act. it is evident that the
transfers of the vacant land were to be regulated by the
specific provisions made in it. They were not to be left to
be governed by the unguided discretion of any authority
including the State Government. The specific provisions for
regulating the transfer have been incorporated in Sections
26 to 28 of the Act. Those provisions permit transfer of
only vacant lands within the ceiling limit but without
buildings, and of vacant lands in excess of the ceiling
limit but with buildings thereon and subject to the
condition s laid down there. It cannot be suggested that in
defiance of the said provisions, Section 20(1)(b) vests
power in the State Government to sanction sales of excess
vacant lands with or without building thereon.Under Section
20(1) (b), the State Government can only exempt such excess
vacant land from being acquired by it. The Government
cannot permit its transfer when the Act, does not even by
implication, authorise it to do so but permits the transfer
subject only to the conditions prescribed by Section
The legislature cannot be presumed to have prescribed
different conditions for transfer of the same or similar
lands. [746 C-H; 747 A]

3. The restriction on transfer even of vacant land within
the ceiling limit but without building is deemed to be
valid. Thus the transfer of the vacant land without
building even if it is within the ceiling limit and of the
vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit with a building
or a portion of the building are subject to the restrictions
placed by the Act. Section 20 is subject to the provisions
of sections which follow it including Sections 26 to
Hence no construction can be placed on clause (b) of subsection (1) thereof which will be in conflict with the
provisions of sections 26 to 28. [747 E, F]

Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim? Singhji v. Union of India, [1981]
1 SCC 166, referred to.

4. Since as per the definition of "person" in Section 2(i)
the said provision viz. S$.20(1) (a) is applicable not only
to individuals, but also to a family, a firm, a company or
an association or body of individuals whether incorporated
or not, the hardship spoken of there, is obviously one
related to the user of the land. In fact, it is difficult
to understand the precise purpose for which clause (b) has
been enacted and the meaning of the expression “undue
hardship" there. One is left only to speculate on the
subject. The

719

speculation itself may not be valid. The lands are held by
companies, trusts and associations for industrial and
commercial use, for the use of medical and educational
institutes, sports, clubs, cultural activities, gardens,
exhibitions etc. There is no special provision made in the

27

28.S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

Act to protect or take care of such users. The only
provision under which a relief can be given to preserve and
safeguard such user is Section 20(1) (a). But that

provision can be pressed into service only on the basis of
the location of the land and its present or prospective user
and only if it passes the test of public interest However,
all lands in excess of the ceiling limit may not strictly be
necessary for such user, even if the user is in the public
interest. Nevertheless, the withdrawal of a part of the
land found to be in excess may cause an avoidable hardship
to the land-holder which may be disproportionate.to the
benefit that is to accrue to the public on account of such
withdrawal. The excess of land may be meager or the
severance of such excess land itself may result in
unnecessary hardship.The hardship further has to be undue
and not merely an ordinary hardship which is bound to be
caused on account of the application of the Act to every
holder of the excess vacant land. The undue hardship must
be one which cannot be avoided except by granting a_ relief
of exemption as contemplated by the said provision. The
relief from financial hardship or from indebtedness to the
land-holder of such land is alien both to the object and the
scheme of the Act. The classification of the owners of land
for this purpose between debtors and non-debtors is itself
irrational and has no plausible nexus with the object of the
Act. Such a classification is, therefore, discriminatory
and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. (748 B-H;

5.The exemption which is granted under Section 20(1)(b)
has to be supported by reasons to be recorded in writing.
This requirement also contemplates an exemption which is
related to and promoted by the use or better use of the
land. If it is the financial hardship which was under the
contemplation of the legislature, them was nothing easier
than to make a reference to the same in clause (b) itself
and to tay down guidelines for the inquiry into such
hardship. The provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 20 ,
directly negative either exemption on account of financial
hardship or for the purpose of the transfer of the land,
since that sub-section empowers the State Government to
withdraw the exemption already granted If the

720

State Government is satisfied that any of the conditions
subject to which the exemption is granted either under
clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) is not complied
with. It is inconceivable that the legislature had in mind
the cancellation of the transfer including sale, which
cannot be done when it has already taken place. [749 E-G]
6.It cannot be said that the legislature which places
restrictions on the transfer of the land within the ceiling
limit would at the same time give a carte blanche for the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

sale of the land in excess of the ceiling limit. For it
would mean, that the State Government cannot have an_ option
to purchase such land and that the sale can be made by the
holder of the excess land at any price that he chooses.
Such a reading of Section 20(i)(b) would militate against
one of the objects of the Act, viz., to prevent speculation
and profiteering in the sale and purchase of _ land.
Moreover, it would be patently discriminatory. Whereas the
holder of vacant land within the ceiling limit would have to
suffer the restrictions placed by Section 26, the holder of
the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit has not to do
so. He would in fact be in a better position. The
provisions with regard to granting such exemption subject to
certain conditions contained in Section 20(1)(b) do not in
any way mitigate the discrimination. When the statute
itself places specific restrictions under Section 26 on the
sale of land within the ceiling limit, it is not possible to
reach a conclusion that the conditions on which the State
Government is empowered to permit the sale can be left to
the discretion of the State Government. In fact, such
discretion given to the State Government would itself be
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, the same being
unguided and  untrammeled This also shows that the
legislature has not given power to the State Government
under Section 20(1)(b) to permit exemption for sale of the
land. Otherwise it would have provided in the section
itself for the conditions on which the permission to sell
can be given and such conditions could not be less onerous
than those provided under Section 26 of the Act. If the
power, to permit sale of the land was intended to be given
only for relieving the land-holder of his financial
hardship, the section could very well have provided for sale
of such land under Section 26 of the Act or made provision
in Section 20(1)(b) itself for the first option of the State
Government to purchase it. It cannot be said that by not
making such provision either in Section 20(1)(b) or Section
26, the legislature intended to permit the sale of such land
at a price above the fair market price payable under the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or the corresponding law and
thereby encourage

721

speculation and profiteering, the very evils which the Act
intended to curb-A [750 E-H; 751 A-C]

7.The provisions of Section 27 also militate against the
conferment of the power on the State Government to permit
exemption of land for the purpose of its transfer. The
provisions of Section 27 refer to any urban or urbanisable
land with a building. The vacant land in excess of the
ceiling limit may be with or without a building. In fact,
the provisions of Section 27 directly negative the
conferment of such power, for the said provisions show that
the legislature did not want the sale of any urban or
urbanisable land with a building whether it is within or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

without the ceiling limit except in accordance with the
provisions of Section 27. For Section 27 speaks of transfer
of any urban or urbanisable land with a building or a
portion only of such building, only with the permission of
the competent authority and on the terms mentioned therein.
This Court has invalidated the provisions of the said
section to the extent they apply to the vacant land with a
building when the land is within the ceiling limit. But it
does apply to land in excess of the ceiling limit and with a
building or a portion of it thereon. It is not possible to
accept that there are two provisions, viz. Section 20(1) (b)
and Section 27 operating at the same time in the same area.
Also there is nothing either in Section 20(1)(b) or Section
27 to exclude the operation of Section 27. [751 G, H; 752 A]
Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim Singhji etc. etc. v. Union of India
JUDGMENT :

8.Section 28 does not make any reference to the transfer permitted by the State Government under
Section 20(1) (b). The holder of the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit has not to face the
restriction on the registration of the document of transfer of his land provided under Section 28
when such transfer is permitted by the State Government under Section 20(1)(b), whereas the
holder of similar land who does not approach the State Government has to suffer the same when he
transfers the land held by him. The discrimination between the transfers under the different
provisions is irrational and, has no nexus with the object ought to be achieved by the classification.
[752 E-G]

g.If the power to exempt the land for sale is read in Section 20 (1) (b) with such conditions as the
State Government may choose to place and if either the State Government chooses not to place any
conditions or to place such conditions as are inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 29 and 30,
it would create two sets of lands one where no restrictions are applicable to the construction thereon
or only such restrictions as the State Government may choose to impose, and the other where the
restrictions on constructions as provided by Section 29 and 30 would be applicable. [752 G-H; 753
A] Per N.P. Singh, J. (Concurring):

1.The object of the Act being imposition of ceiling on vacant land in urban agglomerations and for
acquisition of such land in excess of ceiling limit, with a view to prevent the concentration of urban
land in the hands of a few persons, speculations and profiteering therein, that object will be defeated
if the power under Section 20(1) of the Act is exercised by the State Government to exempt the
excess vacant lands, from the application of Chapter III of the Act, so that the holder thereof can
transfer such lands. [753 C, D]

2.Under Indian conditions the expression "undue hardship" is normally related to economic
hardship. That is why from time to time many holders of lands in excess of the ceiling limit, while
claiming exemption under clause (b) put forth their bad economic condition and indebtedness to
claim exemption along with permission to sell such excess lands. In the modern set up many holders
of such excess lands having undertaken commercial or industrial ventures with the help of the loans
from the Banks and other financial institutions, put the plea of repayment of such loans as undue

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 7S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

hardship for claiming exemption under clause (b) of section 20(1) aforesaid. When different
provisions take into consideration the lands already transferred by the holder, between the period
17th February, 1975 (as specified in sub. sec. (4) of S.4; and the appointed day as well as between the
period commencing from the appointed day and ending with the commencement of the Act, it
should not be easily inferred that the framers of the Act desired that after the commencement of the
Act while exercising the power of exemption under section 20(1) (b) permission should be granted
to holders of such excess lands to transfer such lands to third parties in order to meet their financial
liabilities. [753 G, H; 754 A-F]

3.If Section 21 provides for granting exemption in respect of excess land held by the holder only on a
specific condition that the holder shall utilise the same for the construction of dwelling units for
weaker section, to serve a public cause, the framers of the Act could not have conceived the grant of
exemption under Section 20(1)(b) to the holder of the excess land, only to serve his interest, by
selling such excess lands. [754 H; 755 A-F]

4.If the State Government can exempt the vacant land held by the land holder in excess of the ceiling
limit, from the applicability of the provisions of Chapter III of the Act, in order that the said holder
sells such land to liquidate his debts which amounts to an "undue hardship", then there will be an
apparent conflict between the interest of the land holder and the public interest. In the interest of
the land holder the maximum price fetched by sale of such land will be the solution of his hardship,
whereas that will run counter, to the object of the Act to prevent speculations and profiteering”. It
cannot be said that even in such transfers the dominant purpose of the legislation, to prevent "the
concentration of urban land in hands of few persons" is nonetheless served. The concentration of
urban land in hands of few persons has to be prevented with a view to bring about "an equitable
distribution of land in urban agglomerations to subserve the common good". [755 B-D]

5.If the vacant lands which have vested in the State are also to be disposed of as stipulated under
8.23 strictly keeping in view the spirit and object or the Act, exemption u/s20(1)(b) cannot be
granted to holders of such lands to dispose of the lands in the manner they like, to the persons they
prefer, at the price they dictate, for clearing their debts. If it is conceded that indebtedness amounts
to an undue hardship, then it may cover the debts incurred even after the commencement of the Act.
[756 D, E]

6.This Court has already held that Section 27(1) in so far as it imposes restriction on transfer of any
urban or urbanisable land with a building or of a portion of such building which is within ceiling
area, was invalid. The said sub-section (1) of Section 27 was struck down being unconstitutional.
Section 26 of the Act also imposes certain restrictions on transfer of vacant land even within ceiling
limit. It can therefore be stated that Section 26(1) suffers from the same vice. But neither in that case
nor in this case, this court was or is concerned with Section 26. As such, it is not necessary to
express any opinion in respect of Section 26 of the Act, while considering the issue involved in the
present appeals. [756 G, H; 757 A, B] Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim Singhji etc. etc. v. Union of India &

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SAWANT, J. Leave granted.

2.These appeals arise out of the same facts and judgments of the Karnataka High Court and are
being disposed of by this common judgment. For the sake of the narration of events Civil Appeal
Nos. 1461-72/ 1993 arising out of SLP (Civil) Nos. 7230-41 of 1991 may be referred to.

The 2nd respondent M/s Naryanaswamy & Sons is a partnership firm. While it was carrying on the
business of manufacturing and selling of polished granites, it acquired on 30.9.1953, 6 acres and 4
gunthas of land in Survey Nos. 6/1 and 6/2 of Dasarahalli in the heart of Jayanagar Exten- sion of
the city of Bangalore. Out of the said land, 1 acre and 2 gunthas had already been acquired by the ist
respondent-State Government under notification dated 1.4.1948. The acquisition proceedings had
culminated in an award, granting compensation to the land owner on 3.3.1955. In a small portion of
the said land, the 2nd respondent-firm (hereinafter referred to as the ‘firm'), established a granite
factory and the rest of the land was vacant when the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976
(the 'Act') was made applicable to the Bangalore Agglomeration consisting of the area within the
jurisdiction of the Bangalore City Municipal Corporation and the Trust Board, and the peripheral
area of 5 kms.

3.On 9.6.1983, the firm preferred an application to the State Government for exemption of the
vacant land from the provisions of Chapter III of the Act. By an order of 17.7.1985, the State
Government granted exemption under Section 20 of the Act for industrial use of a granite factory.
The exemption related to 16194 sq. mtrs. of land and was granted on the following conditions:

[i] The entire land utilisation shall be completed within a period of two years from
the date of the order.

[ii] The exempted land shall be exclusively used for the purpose for which the
exemption was granted and for the purposes related thereto.

[iii] The land shall not be transferred by way of sale, mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise
without prior permission of the Government and that such permission, when given,
shall be subject to such conditions as the Government may deem fit to impose.

4.The 3rd respondent-partnership firm M/s. Reevajethu, Builders and Developers [the 'builders']
was constituted on 6.1.1987 with Smt. Shobha Makhija as the major partner with 50% share and

other 18 partners, mainly "to develop the immovable property to be acquired by the firm of an

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 9S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

extent of 5 acres and 24 gunthas situated at Survey Nos. 6/1 and 6/2 of Dasarahalli of Bangalore
City and to carry on the business as builders and developers of flats, shops, commercial complexes
and other types of buildings, dealers in real estate and all other allied business and activities" and to
"carry on any other business as may be mutually agreed upon by all the partners". It is not in dispute
that Smt. Shobha Makhija is the sister of the son-in-law of the 4th respondent who was then the
Chief Minister of the State of Karnataka..

5.On 9.1.1987, the competent authority under the Act came to the conclusion that the excess vacant
land out of the said Survey Nos. 6/1 and 6/2 after the grant of exemption by the Government Order
dated 17.7.1985, was 3444 sq. mtrs. The competent authority accordingly directed the publication of
a notification under Section 10 [1] of the Act for the acquisition of the said excess vacant land.

6.On the same day, i.e., 9.1.1987, the firm made an application to the State Government for
permission to sell land to the extent of 5 acres and 24 gunthas comprised in the said Survey Nos. 6/1
and 6/2 to the builders. The grounds made out in the application were that due to stiff competition,
and nationalisation of black and pink granite by the southern States including Karnataka, the firm
was running under losses; that its Woodlands Hotel at Madras was also not making profits since the
hotel building had become very old and there were no funds for modernising it; that its theaters in
Madras were also not yielding profits due to unhealthy competition by the video piracy and the
advent of the television; that the partners of the firm individually and jointly were indebted to
Andhra Bank, of India, State Bank of Mysore and Dena Bank; that the said debts were of more than
Rs. 1 crore 65 lakhs; that suits had been filed in the High Court of Madras against the partners; that
the business of the partners had been suffering huge losses specially due to continuing heavy
interest burden; that the families of the seven partners of the firm had no other source of income
and had been over-drawing from the firms for their maintenance; and that one of the partners was
seriously ill in a hospital at Bangalore and he had to borrow money for taking medical treatment.

7.On 6.3.1987, the State Government under Section 20 [1] of the Act permitted the firm to sell land
to the extent of 16194 sq. mtrs. to the builders subject to certain conditions.

8.On 23.3.1987, the firm filed another application before the State Government seeking permission
to transfer the remaining 3444 sq. mtrs. of vacant land from Survey Nos. 6/1 and 6/2 to the builders
on the ground of undue hardship since the firm had incurred debts. On 18.4.1987 the State
Government under Section 20 [1](a) of the Act granted exemption for the said land from the
purview of Chapter Ill of the Act and also permitted the firm to sell the said 3444 sq. mtrs. of vacant
land from Survey Nos. 6/1 and 6/2 subject to certain conditions.

9.By a sale deed of 30.9.1987, i.e., a day before the extension of Chapter XXC of the Income-tax Act
providing for preemptive purchase by the Central Government of immovable property in certain
cases on transfer, the firm entered into a deed of absolute sale for the sale of the property consisting
of land to the extent of 5 acres and 24 gunthas situated in the said Survey Nos. 6/1 and 6/2.

10.On this undisputed factual matrix, writ petitions were filed by way of public interest litigation,
under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution before the High Court for issue of a writ of mandamus

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 10S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

[a] directing the respondent- Government to take action for forfeiture of the land for con
travention of Section 79 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act; [b] for acquiring the land for the
purpose of weaker sections under the provisions of the Act; [c] for quashing the orders dated
63.1987. and 18.4.1987 granting exemption to the land in question from the purview of the Act
under Section 20 111(a) & (b) of the Act and for declaring the sale deeds dated 30.9.1987 executed by
the firm in favour of the builders as void and inoperative; (d). for directing the State Government to
take action under Section 6 of the Karnataka Parks, Play-fields, and Open Space [Reservation and
Regulation] Act, 1985 and for other reliefs.

11. The learned Single Judge by his judgment and order dated 8.9.1989allowed the writ petition, and
among others, [1] quashed the Group Housing Policy of the State Government as embodied in the
decision of the Committee held on 22.10.1986 and communicated under letter dated 24.11.1986
insofar as it encouraged the Group Housing Scheme through individuals and partnership of
individuals by transferring vacant land to such persons; [ii] restrained the State Government from
enforcing the said Policy through individuals and partnership of individuals against the vacant land;
[iii] declared as null and void and quashed the orders dated 6.3.1987 and 18.4.1987 granting
exemption; [iv] declared the sale deed dated 30.9.1987 executed by the firm in favour of the builders
as nun and void so far as it related to the extent of land admeasuring 19368 Sq. mtrs. covered by the
exemption orders of 6.3.1987 and 18.4.1987. The validity of the sale deed so far as it related to the
remaining land mentioned therein was, however, saved by the said declaration; [v] directed the
State Government, the Special Deputy Commissioner under the Act, the Bangalore Development
Authority and the Municipal Corporation of Ban- galore to identify the extent of 1 acre, 2 gunthas
and 58 square yards which was acquired in 1948 out of the said Survey No. 6/1 and to set them apart
for the purpose of road and Boulevard and use it only for said purpose; [vi] remitted the applications
dated 9.1.1987 and 24.3.1987 made by the firm to the State Government with the direction to
consider them in accordance with law under Section 20 [1](b) of the Act and to exempt them in the
light of the extent of the debt owed by the firm to the creditors prior to the coming into force of the
Act; [vii] directed that even if after examining the, application in the aforesaid light the State
Government granted permission, to the firm to sell the vacant land on the ground of hardship, the
Government should see that, in the vacant land, sites are formed of various dimensions not
exceeding 60' x 90' keeping in view the sites already formed in the locality. The learned Judge
further directed that each such site should be sold by public auction by the competent authority with
the condition that no person is entitled to purchase in public auction more than one site, and to
credit the sale proceeds in the office of the competent authority under the Act who would pay the
amount to the creditors of the firm. The learned Judge also further directed that only such number
of sites should be sold which are necessary to discharge the debts and the remaining portion of the
vacant land should be acquired under the Act. It may be noted here that the learned Judge held that
the allegations of mala fides in granting exemptions by the orders of 6.3.1987 and 18.4.1987 against
respondents 4 and 8, were not proved.

12.Against the said decision of the learned Single Judge, appeals were preferred before the Division
Bench of the High Court, among others, by writ petitioners as well as the firm and the builders. All

the appeals were heard together and the learned Judges of the Division Bench gave separate but

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 1S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

concurring judgments and set aside the findings as well as the directions given by the learned Single
Judge and dismissed the writ petitions.

13.The precise questions which arise for our consideration in these appeals are:

[i] Were the permissions granted by the State Government to sell land admeasuring
16194 sq. mtrs. and 3444 sq. mtrs. by its orders of 6.3.1987 and 18.4.1987
respectively valid under the Act?

[ii] Were the said orders motivated by mala fides ? and [iii] Is the sale deed executed
by the firm in favour of the builders on 30.9.1987 void and inoperative?

14.In order to appreciate the answer to the first and the third question, it is necessary to understand
the scheme of the Act which came into force on 17.2.1976. As the preamble of the Act states, it has
been placed on the statute book [i] to provide for the imposition of a ceiling on vacant land in urban
agglomerations;, [ii] to provide for the acquisition of which vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit;
and [iii] to regulate the construction of buildings on such land and for matters connected therewith
with a view to [a] preventing the concentration of urban land in the hands of a few persons and
speculation and profiteering therein and [b] bringing, about an equitable distribution of land in
urban agglomerations to subserve the common good. These objects which are otherwise clear from
the preamble of the Act have been explained in the statement of objects and reasons accompanying
the Bill which, among other things, states as follows:

"There has been a demand for imposing a ceiling on urban property also, especially
after the imposition of a ceiling on agricultural lands by the State Governments .

With the growth of population and increasing urbanisation, a need for orderly
development of urban areas has also been felt. It is, therefore, considered necessary
to take measures for exercising social control over the scarce resource of urban land
with a view to ensuring its equitable distribution amongst the various sections of
society and also avoiding speculative transactions relating to land in urban
agglomerations.

xx xx xx The Bill is intended to achieve the following objectives:
[i] to prevent concentration of urban property in the hands of a few persons and
speculation and profiteering therein;

[ii]to bring about socialisation of urban land in urban agglomerations to subserve the
common good by ensuring its equitable distribution;

[iii] to discourage construction of luxury housing leading to conspicuous
consumption of scarce building materials and to ensure the equitable utilisation of

such materials; and [iv] to secure orderly urbanisation. The Bill mainly provides for

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 12S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

the following:- [i] imposition of a ceiling on both ownership and posses
sion of vacant land in urban agglomerations, the ceiling being on a graded basis
according to the classification of the urban agglomeration;

[ii] acquisition of the excess vacant land by the State Government with powers to
dispose of the vacant land to subserve the common good; [iii] payment of an amount
for the acquisition of the excess vacant land, in cash and in bonds; [iv] granting
exemptions in respect of certain specific categories of vacant land; [v] regulating the
transfer of vacant land within the ceiling limit;

[vi] regulating the transfer of urban or urbanisable land with any building [whether constructed
before or after the commencement of the proposed legislation], for a period o f 10 years from the
commencement of the legislation or the construction of the building whichever is later;

[vii] restricting the plinth area for the construction of future residential buildings; and [viii] other
procedural and miscellaneous matters."

It is needless to emphasise that while interpreting the various provisions of the Act the said objects
will have to be kept in view, constantly. However, only those provisions of the Act which have a
bearing on the controversy before us may be referred to.

The ‘vacant land" has been defined in Section 2 (q) as follows:

"vacant land' means land, not being land mainly used for the purpose of agriculture,,
in an urban agglomeration, but does not include [i] land on which construction of a
building is not permissible under the building regulations in force in the area in
which such land is situated, [ii]Jin an area where there are building regulations, the
land occupied by any building which has been constructed before or is being
constructed on, the appointed day with the approval of the appropriate authority and
the land appurtenant to such building; and [iii] in an area where there are no
building regulations, the land occupied by any building which has been constructed
before, or is being constructed on, the appointed day and the land appurtenant to
such building; Provided...

The "land appurtenant’, in relation to any building, has been defined in Section 2(g) 'as follows:

"land appurtenant", in relation to any building, means [i] in an area where there are
building regulations, the minimum extent of land required under such regulations to
be kept as open space for the enjoyment of such building, which in no case shall
exceed' five hundred square metres; or [ii] in an area where there are no building
regulations, an extent of five hundred square metres contiguous to the land occupied
by such building, and includes, in the case of any budding constructed before the
appointed day with a dwelling unit therein, an additional extent not exceeding five

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 13S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

hundred square metres of land, if any, contiguous to the minimum extent referred to
in sub-clause [i] or the extent referred to in sub-clause [ii], as the case may be".

Section 3 states that except as provided in the Act, on and from the commencement of the Act, no
person shall be entitled to hold any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit. The "ceiling limit" is
prescribed in Section 4. The provisions of Section 4, so far as they are relevant for our purpose, may
be reproduced verbatim:

"4. Ceeling Limit. [1] Subject to the other provisions of this section, in the case of
every person, the ceiling limit shall be,- [a] x x x x x x [b] where such land is situated
in an urban agglomeration falling within category B specified in Schedule 1, one
thousand square metres;

[c] xxxxxxx[d]xxxxxxx
2.XXXXXXXx

3.Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section [1], where in respect of any
vacant land any scheme for group housing has been sanctioned by any authority
competent in this behalf immediately before the commencement of this Act, then, the
person holding such vacant land at such commencement shall be entitled to continue
to hold such land for the,purpose of group housing:

Provided that no more than one dwelling unit in the group housing shall be owned by
one single person;

Provided further, that the extent of vacant land which such person shall be entitled to
hold shall, in no case, exceed
[a] the extent required under any building regulations governing such group housing; or [b] the
extent calculated by multiplying the number of dwelling units in the group housin g and the
appropriate ceiling limit referred to in sub-section [1], whichever is less."

Section 5(3) prohibits transfer of the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit or any part thereof by
way of sale, mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise until the land-holder has furnished a statement under
Section 6 of the Act and a notification regarding the excess vacant land held by him, has been
published under sub-section [1] of Section 10. Any such transfer is deemed to be null and void.
Section 6(1) requires every person holding vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit at the
commencement of the Act, to file a statement before the competent authority under the Act. Read
with Section 7, it is clear that the statement to be filed under Section 6(1) has to include vacant land
not only situate in the same State but also in other States to which the Act applies. In the present
case, admittedly, the firm held land also in Madras in addition to the land in dispute in the city of
Bangalore. It is not known whether the firm had vacant land in its possession in Madras in addition
to the land in dispute and whether it had shown such land in its return. However, that is not the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 14S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

subject matter of dispute before us.

Section 8 provides for a draft statement to be prepared by the competent authority, as regards the
vacant land held by the person concerned and calculated on the basis of the statement filed by him
under Section 6 after holding an inquiry into the matter. The draft statement is to be served on the
person concerned with the notice requiring him to prefer his objections, if any.

Section 9 provides for the final statement with regard to the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit
to be prepared by the competent authority and to be served on the person concerned.

After the service of the final statement under Section 9, on the person concerned, the competent
authority is required by Section 10(1) to cause a notification to be published in Official Gazette
giving the particulars of such vacant land and stating therein [i] that such land is to be acquired by
the concerned State Government and [ii] the claims of all the persons interested in such vacant land
be made by them giving particulars of the nature of their interest in the land. Under Section 10(2),
the competent authority is required to determine the nature and extent of such claims and pass such
orders as it deems fit. Section 10(3) provides that at any time after the publication of the notification
under Section 10(1), the competent authority may by another notification published in the Official
Gazette of the State concerned, declare that the excess vacant land referred to in the notification
published under Section 10(1) shall with effect from such date as may be specified in the declaration,
be deemed to have been acquired by the State Government. Upon the publication of such
declaration, the vacant land is deemed to have been vested absolutely in the State Government free
from all encumbrances with effect from the date so specified. Section 10 (4) then prohibits transfer
of the excess vacant land and also the alteration of the use of such land between the date of
notification published under Section 10(1) and that of the notification published under Section
10(3). Section 10(5) enables the competent authority to pass an order requiring the person in
possession of the excess vacant land to surrender the same to the State Government. Section 11
requires the State Government to pay compensation to the person or persons having interest in the
vacant land acquired under Section 10(3), at the rates mentioned therein.

Section 19 exempts certain lands from the provisions of Chapter III of the Act which comprises
Sections 3 to 24. Then come the provisions of Section 20 to 24 of Chapter 111. We are directly
concerned in the present appeals with the said sections along with the provisions of chapter IV of
the Act.

Section 20 permits the State Government to give exemption to any vacant land in excess of the
ceiling limit, from the provisions of Chapter III, for two distinct purposes. It is necessary to

reproduce here the said section:

20.Power to exempt. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any of the foregoing
provisions of this Chapter,
(a) where any person holds vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit and the State
Government is satisfied, either on its own motion or otherwise, that, having regard to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 15S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

the location of such land, the purpose for which such land is being or is proposed to
be used and such other relevant factors as the circumstances of the case may require,
it is necessary or expedient in the public interest so to do, that Government may, by
order, exempt, subject to such con
ditions, if any as may be specified in the order, such vacant land from the provisions
of this Chapter;

(b) where any person holds vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit and the State
Government, either on its own motion or otherwise, is satisfied that the application
of the provisions of this Chapter would cause undue hardship to such person, that
Government may by order, exempt subject to such conditions, if any, as may be
specified in the order, such vacant land from the provisions of this Chapter:

Provided that no order under this clause shall be made unless the reasons for doing
so are recorded in writing.

[2] If at any time the State Government is satisfied that any of the conditions subject
to which any exemption under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) is granted is
not complied with by any person, it shall be competent for the State Government to
withdraw, by order, such exemption after giving a reasonable opportunity to such
person for making a representation against the proposed withdrawal and thereupon
the provisions of this Chapter shall apply accordingly.

It would be apparent from clause (a) of sub-section [1] of the section that under it, the State
Government is given power to exempt the excess vacant land from the operation of Chapter III only
if the State Government is satisfied that having regard to [i] the location of the land and [ii] the
purpose for which it is being or is proposed to be used, it is necessary or expedient in the public
interest to exempt it. The paramount consideration is the public interest. The exemption granted
under this provision may be subject to certain conditions. But, it does not appear that it is obligatory
to impose such conditions. Nor is it necessary to record reasons when exemption is granted under
this clause.

The power to exempt such land under clause (b) of sub- section [1] can be exercised by the State
Government, if it is satisfied that the application of Chapter III would cause undue hardship to the
landholder. The exemption may be granted under this clause subject to such conditions, if any, as
may be specified in the order. But, unlike under clause (a), there is no obligation to prescribe the
conditions. The 'permission given under this clause, however, has to be supported by reasons to be
recorded in writing.

Sub-section [2] of the section enables the government to withdraw the exemption granted either
under clause (a) or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 16S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

(b), if is satisfied that any of the conditions subject to which the exemption is given, is not complied’
with. Clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section [1] read with subsection [2] make it clear that the exemption
may either be conditional or absolute. Where it is conditional, it may be withdrawn, if any of the
conditions are not complied with. The very fact, however, that the legislature has con- templated
imposition of conditions on exemptions granted under both the clauses, shows that the purpose of
the exemption under either of the clauses cannot be the transfer of the land. The exemption under
clause (a) is obviously for the land being put to a particular use which use is also necessary or
expedient in the public interest, while exemption under clause (b) is for relieving the person
concerned from any undue hardship which may be caused to him personally, by the withdrawal of
the excess land from his possession probably such as when the person may require the land for the
expansion of the use to which he has already put it, such as his growing business or activities or to
accommodate his growing family. The clause unfortunately is completely silent on what it intends to
convey by the expression "undue hardship". Section 21 also contemplates exemption of the excess
vacant land from the operation of the said Chapter but for a purpose other than for the use of the
holder of the land. The purpose contemplated there is the construction of dwelling units of the
plinth area of not more than 80 sq. mtrs. for accommodation of the weaker sections of the society
and in accordance with a scheme approved by such authority as the State Government may specify
in that behalf. The person desiring exemption under this Section has further to declare his intention
for construction of such dwelling units for weaker sections within such time, in such form and in
such manner as may be prescribed. Such declaration is to be made before the competent authority.
The competent authority, after receiving such declaration may, after making such inquiry as it
deems fit, declare such land not to be excess land for the purposes of the said Chapter and permit
such person to continue to hold such land for the aforesaid purpose subject to such terms and
conditions as may be prescribed. Where any such condition is contravened, the competent authority
has been given power to declare the land to be excess land and on such declaration, the, provisions
of Chapter III of the Act are to apply.

The distinction between Sections 20 and 21 may be noticed at this stage. In the first instance, the
power given under Section 20 is to the State Government and not to the competent authority. The
power given is to exempt the land, and the exemption is to be granted to a person. The purpose of
exemption is either public interest or relief from personal undue hardship. It does not appear to be
obligatory on the State Government to prescribe any conditions while granting the exemption.
However, if any conditions are specified and if the State Government later satisfied that there is
non-compliance of any of the conditions, the State Government is given power to withdraw the
exemption.

As far as Section 21 is concerned, the power conferred by it is not to exempt the land but to declare it
not to be excess for the purposes of Chapter III. The power is given to the competent authority itself.
It is to be exercised by it only under one circumstance. That circumstance is that the holder of the
vacant land should declare before it within a specified time and in the prescribed form and manner,
that he desires to utilise the land for the construction of the dwelling units of not more than the
particular size mentioned therein for accommodating the weaker sections and in accordance with
any scheme approved by the specified authority. it is the competent authority which is required to
make inquiry as it deems fit into such a declaration, and if it is satisfied, to declare that such land

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 17S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

shall not be excess within the meaning of the said Chapter. However, it appears that the competent
authority is required to prescribe certain terms and conditions while declaring the land not to be an
excess land, including a condition with regard to the time limit within which such buildings are to be
constructed, and on the breach of any of the conditions, the competent authority is also given power
to declare the land to be an excess land.

Section 22 enables a person to hold the vacant land on which there stood a building which he
demolished or destroyed or which was demolished or destroyed on account of natural causes. The
holder of such land is required to file a statement in that behalf within the specified time and if the
competent authority is satisfied that such land is required by the holder for the purpose of
redevelopment in accordance with the master plan, the authority may, subject to such conditions
and restrictions, permit the holder to retain such land for such purpose. However, if the competent
authority is not so. satisfied and does not therefore, give permission for redevelopment, the
provisions of Sections 6 to 14 of the Act become applicable even to such land.

Section 23 provides for the disposal by the State Government of the vacant land acquired under the
Act or acquired under any other law. The State Government may allot such land to any person for
any purpose relating to or in connection with any industry or for providing residential
accommodation, of such type as may be approved by the State Government, to the employees of any
industry. The 'industry' is defined for the purpose to mean any business, profession, trade,
undertaking or manufacture. While making such allotment, the State Government may impose such
conditions as may be specified in the order of allotment. A breach of any of the conditions imposed
enables the State Government to cancel the allotment, and on such cancellation the land revests in
the State Government free from all encumbrances. Sub- section [4] thereof also enjoins the State
Government to dispose of the vacant lands to subserve the common good on such terms and
conditions as the State Government may deem fit to impose. Sub-section 15] thereof gives the State
Government an overriding power and enables it to retain or reserve any vacant land acquired under
the Act for the benefit of the public, notwithstanding anything contained in sub-sections [1] to [4].

Section 24 enables the State Government to assign a part or whole of the acquired land to those
persons who had leased out or mortgaged with possession, of the said land or had given such land
under a hire-purchase agreement and as a consequence of which they are left with no vacant land or.
are left with vacant land which is less in extent than the ceiling limit.

Chapter IV of the Act deals with the regulation of transfer and use of urban property. Section 26
prohibits the sale of vacant land within the ceiling limit except after giving notice in writing to the
competent authority, of the intended transfer. Where the notice is given, the competent authority
shall have the first option to purchase the land on behalf of the State Government at a price
calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or of any other
corresponding law for the time being in force. The option has, however, to be exercised within a
period of sixty days from the date of the receipt of the notice and if no such option is exercised, it
will be presumed that the competent authority has no intention to purchase the land, and it shall
then be lawful for such person to transfer the land to whomsoever, he may like.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 18S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

Section 27 prohibits transfer of any urban or urbanisable land by way of sale, mortgage, gift, lease
for a period exceeding ten years, or otherwise, if such land is with a building, whether constructed
before or after the commencement of the Act. It also prohibits a similar transfer of the land with a
portion only of such building. The restriction on the transfer of Such land is for a period of ten years
of the commencement of the Act or from the date on which the building is constructed whichever is
later, except with the previous permission of the competent authority. The competent authority is
given power to grant or refuse permission to transfer, after holding an inquiry. If the permission is
not refused within sixty days of the receipt of the application, the permission is deemed to have been
granted. If the permission applied for is for the transfer of such land by way of sale, the competent
authority is given the first option to purchase such land with the building or a portion of the
building, as the case may be, and if the option is not exercised within sixty days, the applicant is free
to sell the land to any person he may like. For the purpose of calculating the price, where the
purchase is made by the authority, the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or of the
corresponding- law are made applicable. This Section has since been, struck down by this Court in
Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim Singhji etc. etc. v. Union of India & Ors., [1981] 1 SCC 166 to the extent it
operates on the vacant lands within the ceiling limit. In other words, as the law stands today, the
section applies only to transfer of the urban and urbanisable lands in excess of the ceiling limit and
which have a building or a portion of building constructed thereon. Section 29 prohibit s
construction of buildings with dwelling units with a plinth area exceeding particular dimensions,
depending upon the category to which the urban agglomerations belong.

Section 30 gives power to the competent authority to stop or demolish construction which is being
made or made in contravention of Section 29.

Section 35 gives power to the State Government to issue orders and directions of a general character
as it may consider necessary in respect of any matter relating to the powers and duties of the
competent authority and the competent authority has to give effect to such orders and directions.

Section 36 gives power to the Central Government to. give such directions to any State as may
appear to it to be necessary for carrying into execution in the State concerned, any of the provisions
of the Act or-of any rules made thereunder. The Central Government may also under this Section
require any State Government to furnish such returns, statistics, accounts and other information as
may be deemed necessary.

15.The examination of the aforesaid relevant provisions of the Act shows a clear intention of the
legislature and reveals a definite scheme. It has to be admitted that the provisions of the Act as are
drafted have not succeeded in translating into, words the clear intention of the legislature and to
that extent the Act is an inelegant and confused piece of drafting. However, since the intention is
clear, a harmonious reading of all the provisions consistent with that intention is necessary to
interpret and understand each of the said provisions. The intention of the legislature is to acquire all
vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit prescribed by the Act and the main purpose of the Act, as
stated earlier, is three-fold, viz., [i] to prevent concentration of the urban land in the hands of a few
persons and to prevent speculation and profiteering therein; [ii] to distribute the urban land
equitably and [iii] to regulate the construction of buildings on the urban lands. Consistent with these

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 19S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

objectives, the Act provides for acquisition of all urban vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit and
prohibits its transfer in any form absolutely. All that the Act permits in the case of such excess
vacant land is either express exemption from the operation of Sections 3 to 19 of Chapter III of the
Act by the State Government under Section 20 or non-declaration of such land as an excess vacant
land by the competent authority under Section 21 or the retention of such land with the land-holder
to be permitted by the competent authority under Section 22 of the Act.

The effect of exemption of the land from the provisions of Sections 3 to 19 or of the non-declaration
of the land as excess land or of the retention of the land with the land-holder under Sections 20, 21
and 22 respectively, is not to permit the land-holder to deal with it as he likes including to transfer
it. In fact, the exemption, the non-declaration an the retention permitted, is on certain conditions
which are required to be prescribed by the State Government or the competent authority as the case
may be. If those conditions are not complied with or are contravened, the State Government or the
competent authority is given power to withdraw the exemption or to declare the land as excess. This
power given to the State Government and the competent authority itself negatives either power to
permit the transfer or the right to transfer. What is more, Chapter IV which alone makes provisions
for transfer and use of urban property, makes provision for transfer of vacant land within the ceiling
limit subject to certain conditions. It also makes provisions for the transfer of land in excess of the
ceiling limit with a building thereon or with a portion of such building. It makes, however, no
provision for transfer of land in excess of the ceiling limit without a building or a portion of a
building thereon. That is consistent with the object of the Act since the Act does not contemplate
transfer of the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit. It only provides for exemption of such land
from being acquired and vested in the State* Government or for non- declaration of it as an excess
land or for the retention of the same with the holder and that too subject to certain conditions which
may be prescribed, as stated earlier.

16.It is against the background of the aforesaid provisions of the Act that we have to consider
whether the two permissions given by the State Government to the firm on 6.3.1987 and 18.4.1987
to sell land admeasuring 16194 sq.mtrs. and 3444 Sq. mtrs. respectively under Section 20 (1), are
legal.

17.Taking, first, the order dated 6.3.1987, it does not mention under which provision of Section 20
(1) the exemption is granted, viz., whether under clause (a) or (b) thereof It is, however, conceded
before us on behalf of the respondents that the exemption is not under clause (a) but. is under
clause (b). We have, therefore, to examine the said exemption with reference to the provisions of
clause

(b). Section 20 (1)(b), as stated earlier, permits the State Government to exempt the vacant land
from the provisions of Chapter III of the Act, if either on its own motion or otherwise, it is satisfied
that the application of the said Chapter "would cause undue hardship to such person”. The order of
exemption may further be subject to such conditions, if any, as in any be specified in it. The reasons
for passing the order have further to be recorded in writing. The preamble of the present order
states that by the earlier order dated 17.7.1985, the firm was granted exemption of the very same
land for locating industry on conditions contained in it. One of the conditions was that the declarant

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 20S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

shall not transfer the land in question without prior permission of the Government. The order then
proceeds to refer to a letter dated 20.1.1987 of the Special Deputy Commissioner, Bangalore
recommending the grant if permission to sell the said land on certain conditions. The order states
that the Government has considered the undue hardship of the applicants and agrees to grant
permission to sell the said land. The order does not discuss the undue hardship of the applicants. It
is possible that the Government for that purpose relied upon the report of the Special Deputy
Commissioner. It appears from the record that the report of the Special Deputy Commissioner is of
29.1.1987 and not of 20.1.1987. It is possible that there is a typographical error either in the record
or in the order. Be that as it may. The said report of the Special Deputy Commissioner refers to the
application made by the firm for grant of permission for the sale of the land "for their undue
hardship’. The report then mentions the properties declared by the firm. All the properties, which
are four in number and one of which is the land in dispute, are situate in Bangalore. There is no
mention of the properties which admittedly the appellants had in Madras. What is necessary to note
here is that it is also stated in the report that the land in dispute has a building of dwelling units and
non-dwelling units over a plinth area of 1618.80 sq. mtrs. constructed prior to the commencement
of the Act. It also states that there is a factory on. the land running since 50 years which
manufactures the polished stones. exported to foreign countries. The report then refers to what the
firm had stated in its application for permission to sell the land. The application had mentioned
among other things, as follows "[a] due to lot of competition and nationalisation of the black and
pink granites by southern States including Karnataka, the firm had been suffering losses in the
abovesaid business;

[b] the partners of this firm are the partners of a firm known as "Woodlands" which has been
carrying business in hoteliers and the said hotel is not making profits due to the fact that the
buildings are very old and due to paucity of funds;

[el that firm has constructed twin-theatres on the front side of the hotel just to diversify the
business.

[d] that they have incurred heavy loans from banks and private parties for the purpose of
construction of theaters and the partners who are the partners of the applicant firm are responsible
to liquidate the loans;

[e] the Madras firm has suffered heavy loss to a tune, of Rs. 22,23,016.26 as on 31.3.1986." [The firm
has under this head shown term loan (if Rs. 57.57 lakhs from the Andhra Bank and Rs. 19.03 lakhs
from the Bank of India and Rs. 17.29 lakhs from the State Bank of Mysore.

They have also mentioned Rs. 51.80 lakhs from private parties but their names are not disclosed.
They have also mentioned other liabilities to the tune of Rs. 3.87 lakhs but their details are not
given.] "[f] that the net capital and current accounts show a debit balance of Rs. 47.94 lakhs".

[They also further state that if the loan from 1.4J986 to 31.12.1986 is taken into account, the debit
balance of the partners would b e about Rs. 68 lakhs.] "[g] that the bank-authorities have filed suits
in the High Court of Madras to attach their properties both in Bangalore and Madras; [h] that a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 21S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

private party by the name of Sri P.L. Narayanaswamy Reddivar has also filed a suit in the Karnataka
High Court to recover the loan due to them from, the Madras firm;" The application had further
stated that the Madras firm is not able even to pay the interest as it is running at a huge loss. It had
also been stated that it had become a mental torture to clear the liabilities and to face the court cases
pending for attachment. It had then gone on to state that there was no other way to dispose of the
property in Bangalore, i.e., the disputed property to clear the above debts and that even the amount
derived from the sale of the land in question would not be sufficient to liquidate the liabilities.

The report further states that the firm had produced the statement of profit and loss account and
balance sheet as on 31.3.1986 and copies of suits filed by the Bank of India in Madras and by the
said Sri P.D. Narayanaswamy Reddiyar in the High Court of Karnataka. After only reciting the above
facts but without mentioning even the price at which the land in dispute was proposed to be sold,
the Special Deputy Commissioner has proceeded to recommend the permission to sell the land to
the builders under Section 20 of the Act. The application for permission itself had not mentioned
the price. The recommendation is in respect of not only 16194 sq. mtrs. but also in respect of 3444
sq. mtrs. It may be mentioned here that the firm had not made any application for exemption or
permission to sell the said 3444 sq. mtrs. till at least 24th March, 1987. Yet, the Special Deputy
Commissioner recommended in his report of 20/29.1.87 that the earlier exempted land of 16194 sq.
mtrs. may be permitted to be sold along with the said 3444 sq. mtrs. He has of course recommended
conditions to be imposed while granting the permission to sell.

The State Government has also not independently enquired into the genuineness of the debts, the
value of all the assets of the firm held by it in Bangalore, Madras or elsewhere, and whether the
debts were as on the date of the commencement of the Act and whether any of the debts were
incurred subsequent to the said date, what was the price at which the land was proposed to be sold,
whether the assets other than the land in question could not have been sold to meet the debts and if
at all it was necessary to sell the land in question, whether the sale only of a part of the land would
not have relieved the firm of its obligations. Without such inquiry, the Government by its order in
question granted permission to sell 16194 sq. mtrs. of land. Close on the heels, however, followed
another order dated 18.4.1987 by which the balance of 3444 sq. mtrs. was permitted to be sold
relying upon another report of the Special Deputy Commissioner. The record before us shows that
the said report is of 27.3.1989. We may, however, presume a typographical error and construe it as a
report of 27.3.1987.However, what is worth nothing is that the application for permission to sell the
said 3444 sq. mtrs. was filed by the firm allegedly on 24.3.87. It seems that with commendable
alacrity the Special Deputy Commissioner made his report on the said application, on 27.3.1987 [if
we are to read the year as 1987 instead of 1989 as the document shows]. What he has stated in his
report may be summarised as under: That the Government by its order dated 6.3.1987 had already
accorded permission to sell excess vacant land admeasuring 16194 sq. mtrs. The remaining excess
vacant land held by the firm is 3444 sq. mtrs. Orders had been passed as required under Section
8(4) of the Act on 9.1.1987 confirming the said excess vacant land. In the meanwhile, the firm
presented another application on 24.3.1987 to the Government requesting for grant of exemption
under Section 20 with permission to sell the said excess land admeasuring 3444 sq. mtrs. and
another land admeasuring 5,648 sq. mtrs. which consisted of land with building as per Section 4
(1)(b) of the Act, to the builders. That the firm stated that they had got the liabilities to the private

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 22S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

parties [who were for the first time named there]. They are 13 in number. The liabilities were shown
as having arisen between 20.1.1975 and 7.12.1977 with a specific mention that the liabilities were
from a date prior to the coming into force of the Act. These liabilities to the private parties
amounted to Rs. 4,11,279.56. In addition to 13 private creditors, Dena Bank is the 14th and the last
editor shown there to whom Rs. 65,420.44 were owed from 15.4.1969. The firm had produced
certificates from the creditors and a certificate from the auditors in support of the said liabilities.
The report ends by stating that "in the cir- cumstances explained above, the requests of the firm to
grant exemption under Section 20 with permission to sell the said balance vacant land of 3444 sq.
mitrs. to the builders may be considered."

It is not known when the reference of the said application was made to the Special Deputy
Commissioner for giving his report. All that is known is that on 18.4.1987, the Government passed
an order permitting the firm to sell the land admeasuring 3444 sq. mtrs. on the conditions
mentioned therein. This order also does not discuss, like the earlier order of 6.3.1987, the various
factors which need to be considered while granting permission to sell. It is, however, not necessary
to discuss this aspect of the matter since we are allowing the appeals on the primary ground that the
State Government had no power to grant permission to the firm to sell the land in question. If,
however, it was necessary to go into the said question, it must be stated that there is much force in
the contention of the appellants that the State Government had not applied its mind to the relevant
factors relating to the alleged indebtedness of the firm and hence the permission granted to the firm
to sell the land was liable to be struck down on that ground also.

18.The first question that arises is whether the provisions of Section 20111 (b) permit the State
Government to permit the sale of the excess vacant land to a third party. According to us, the answer
has to be in the negative for reasons more than one.

In the first instance, the central object of the Act, as is evident both from the preamble as well as the
statement of objects and reasons, is to acquire vacant land in excess of the ceiling area and to
prevent speculation and profiteering in the same and also to distribute the land equitably to
subserve the common good. It is, therefore, per se against the said object to permit the sale of the
excess vacant land for whatever reasons, including the undue hardship of the' land-holder. To
construe the provisions of Section 20 [1]

(b) so as to read in them the conferment of such power on the State Government for whatever
reasons, is to distort and defeat the whole purpose of the legislation. Further, neither the plain
language of the clause nor its context and intendment merit such construction.Section 20 itself is
titled "Power to exempt". The power given to the State Governments under the Section is only to
exempt certain excess vacant lands from the operation of the provisions of Sections 3 to 19 of
Chapter III, none of which refers to the subject of transfer or restrictions on transfer. Those
provisions relate to the calculation, declaration, acquisition and vesting of the excess vacant land. It
is Chapter IV which relates to the transfers of vacant lands and the restrictions thereon. Further,
from the scheme of the Act, it is evident that the transfers of the vacant land were to be regulated by
the specific provisions made in it. They were not to be left to be governed by the unguided discretion
of any authority including the State Government. The specific provisions for regulating the transfer

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 23S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

have been incorporated in Sections 20 to 28 of the Act. Those provisions permit transfer of only
vacant lands within the ceiling limit but without buildings, and of vacant lands in excess of the
ceiling limit but with buildings thereon and subject to the conditions laid down there. It cannot be
suggested that in defiance of the said provisions, Section 20 [1](b) vests power in the State
Government to sanction sales of excess vacant lands with or without building thereon. Under
Section 20 [1](b), the State Government can only exempt such excess vacant land from being
acquired by it. The Government cannot permit its transfer when the Act does not even by
implication authorises it to do so but permits the transfer subject only to the conditions prescribed
by Section 27. The legislature cannot be presumed to have prescribed different conditions for
transfer of the same or similar lands.

Secondly, Section 20 begins with the non-obstante clause "notwithstanding anything contained in
any of the foregoing provisions of this Chapter", meaning thereby Chapter III of the Act. The
foregoing provisions of Chapter III viz.., Sections 3 to 19, as stated earlier, do not contain any
provision permitting or restricting the transfer of the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit. The
provisions relating to the transfer of the vacant land are contained in Sections 26 to 28 of Chapter
IV. Section 26 lays down restrictions on the transfer of the vacant land even if it is within the ceiling
limit, while Section 27 places restriction on the transfer of any urban or urbanisable land with a
building or portion of such building thereon for a period of ten years from the commencement of the
Act or from the date on which the building is constructed, whichever is later, except with the
previous permission of the competent authority. Section 27 as couched is wide in its implication and
hence this Court by its decision in Bhuimsinghji's case Supral restricted its operation to lands with
buildings which are above the ceiling limit. However, the court has upheld the validity of the rest of
the Act including that of Section 26. The result is, the restriction on transfer even of vacant land
within the ceiling limit but without building is deemed to be valid. Thus the transfer of the vacant
land without building even if it is within the ceiling limit and of the vacant land in excess of the
ceiling limit with a building or a portion of the building are subject to the restrictions placed by the
Act. Section 20, as pointed out earlier, is subject to the provisions of sections which follow it
including Sections 26 to 28. Hence no construction can be placed on clause (b) of sub-section [1]
thereof which will be in conflict with the provisions of Sections 26 to 28.

Thirdly, the provisions of clauses (a) and (b) of sub- section [1] of Section 20 make it clear that what
the legislature has in mind is an exemption for the purposes of the use- of the land and not for the
purposes of selling it. Sub-section II] (a) speaks of exemption of such land having regard to its
location, the purposes for which the land is being or is proposed to be used and such other relevant
factors as the circumstances of the case may require. The said provisions further require that even
after taking into consideration the said circumstances, the State Government has to examine, before
giving ex
emption, whether it is necessary or expedient in the public interest to do so. The Government is also
empowered under the said provisions to grant such exemption conditionally. Sub-section [1] (b)
similarly, speaks of the undue hardship caused on account of the application of the provisions of
Chapter III. Since as per the definition of "person" in Section 2 [i], the said provision is applicable
not only to individuals, but also to a family, a firm, a company or an association or body of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 24S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

individuals whether incorporated or not, the hardship spoken of there is obviously one related to the
user of the land. In fact, it is difficult to understand the precise purpose for which clause (b) has
been enacted and the meaning of the expression "undue hardship" there. We are left only to
speculate on the subject. The speculation itself may not be valid. The lands are held by companies,
trusts and associations for industrial and commercial use, for the use of medical and educational
institutes, sports, clubs, cultural activities, gardens, exhibitions etc. There is no special provision
made in the Act to protect or take care of such users. The only provision under which a relief can be
given to preserve and safeguard such user is Section 20 [1] (a). But that provision can be pressed
into service only on the basis of the location of the land and its present or prospective user and only
if it passes the test of public interest. However, all lands in excess of the ceiling limit may not strictly
be necessary for such user, even if the user is in the public interest. Nevertheless, the withdrawal of a
part of the land found to be in excess may cause an avoidable hardship to the land-holder which may
be disproportionate to the benefit that is to accrue to the public on account of such withdrawal. The
excess of land may be meager or the severance of such excess land itself may result in unnecessary
hardship. The hardship further has to be undue and not merely an ordinary hardship which is
bound to be caused on account of the application of the Act to every holder of the excess vacant land.
The undue hardship must be one which cannot be avoided except by granting a relief of exemption
as contemplated by the said provision. The relief from financial hardship or from indebtedness to
the land- holder of such land is alien both to the object and the scheme of the Act. Even the debates
in the Parliament do not refer to financial hardship or to the power of the State Government to
exempt the land to permit its transfer on that account. To hold that indebtedness and financial
hardship would entitle the landholder to get exemption for sale of the excess vacant land in his
possession is to place the holders of land with debts in an advantageous position as against those
who were unwise enough to manage their affairs with financial discipline. The classification of the
owners of land for this purpose between debtors and non-debtors is itself irrational and has no
plausible nexus with the object of the Act. Such a classification is, therefore, discriminatory and
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. It is not, therefore, possible to agree with the view taken by
the Gujarat High Court in Thakorbhai Dajibhai Desai v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1980 Guj. 189 that the
indebtedness of the land-holder on the date of the commencement of the Act can be a ground for
exemption under Section 20 [1] (b). Much less can such a ground vest the State Government with
the power to permit the sale of the land. As has been explained earlier, under the Act no transfer of
vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit is permitted whether with or without condition, if it is not
encumbered with a building or a portion of a building. It can either be acquired by the State
Government under Section 10 [3] of the Act or exempted from being acquired or permitted to be
retained under Sections 20, 21 and 22 respectively. It can in no case be transferred. However, if it is
so encumbered, the provisions of Section 27 become ap- plicable to the transfer of the land and no
transfer of such land can be effected in contravention of the provisions of the said section. There is
nothing either in Section 20 or Section 27 which exempts the transfer of such land from the
operation of the provisions of Section 27, assuming that Section 20 (1) (b) gives power to the State
Government to permit the sale of such land.

Fourthly, the exemption which is granted under Section 20 [1] (b) has to be supported by reasons to
be recorded in writing. This requirement also contemplates an exemption which is related to and

prompted by the use or better use of the land. If it is the financial hardship which was under the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 25S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

contemplation of the legislature, there was nothing easier than to make a reference to the same in
clause (b) itself and to lay down guidelines for the inquiry into such hardship.

Fifthly, the provisions of sub-section [2] of Section 20, directly negative either exemption on
account of financial hardship or for the purpose of the transfer of the land, since that sub-section
empowers the State Government to withdraw the exemption already granted if the State
Government is satisfied that any of the conditions subject to which the exemption is granted either
under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section [1] is not complied with. It is inconceivable that the
legislature had in mind the cancellation of the transfer including sale, which cannot be done when it
has already taken place.

Sixthly, as pointed out earlier, when the legislature wanted to provide for sale or transfer of the
vacant land, it has done so specifically in Chapter IV which exclusively deals with the "Regulation of
transfer and use of urban property’. Sections 26,27 and 28 of the said Chapter together provide for
sales of vacant land and for the registration of such sales. Section 26 restricts the sale of land even if
it is within the ceiling limit except after giving notice in writing of the intended transfer to the
competent authority. When such notice is given, the competent authority has the first option to
purchase the land on behalf of the State Government and at a price calculated in accordance with
the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or of any other corresponding law for the time
being in force. It is only when the competent authority does not exercise its option to purchase the
land within sixty days from the date of receipt of the notice, that it is lawful for the holder of the land
to transfer the same to whomsoever he may like. The provisions of Section 26 further show that the
price to be calculated for the purchase of the land when the competent authority exercises its option
is on the basis that the notification under sub-section [1] of Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act or
under the relevant provision of any other corresponding law had been issued on the date on which
the notice was given of the intended transfer by the holder of the land, to the competent authority.
This provision makes it abundantly clear that the exemption to be granted under Section 20 1 11 (b)
is not for the sale of the excess vacant land. It is difficult to hold that the legislature which places
restrictions on the transfer of the land within the ceiling limit would at the same time give a carte
blanch for the sale of the land in excess of the ceiling limit. For it would mean, firstly, that the State
Government cannot have an option to purchase such land and secondly the sale can be made by the
holder of the excess land at any price that he chooses. In the first instance, such a reading of Section
20 Ill (b) would militate against one of the objects of the Act, viz., to prevent speculation and
profiteering in the sale and purchase of land. Secondly, it would be patently discriminatory.
Whereas the holder of vacant land within the ceiling limit would have to suffer the restrictions
placed by Section 26, the holder of the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit has not to do so. He
would in fact be in a better position. The provisions with regard to granting such exemption subject
to certain conditions contained in Section 20 [1] (b) do not in any way mitigate the discrimination.
Firstly, when the statute itself places specific restrictions under Section 26 on the sale of land within
the ceiling limit, it is not possible to hold that the conditions on which the State Government is
empowered to permit the sale can be left to the discretion of the State Government. In fact, such
discretion given to the State Government would itself be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution
the same being unguided and untrammeled. This also shows that the legislature has not given power
to the State Government under Section 20 ill (b) to permit exemption for sale of the land. Otherwise

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 26S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

it would have provided in the section itself for the conditions on which the permission to sell can be
given and such conditions could not be less onerous than those provided under Section 26 of the
Act. Secondly, if the power to permit sale of the land was intended to be given only for relieving the
land-holder of his financial hardship, the section could very well have provided for sale of such land
under Section 26 of the Act or made provision in Section 20 ill (b) itself for the first option of the
State Government to purchase it. It is not suggested that by not making such provision either in
Section 20 111 (b) or Section 26, the legislature intended to permit the sale of such land at a price
above the fair market price payable under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or the corresponding law
and thereby encourage speculation and profiteering, the very evils which the Act intended to curb.
Seventhly, section 27 in Chapter IV is another provision which prohibits the transfer of any urban or
urbanisable land with a building whether constructed before or after the commencement of the Act
or a portion only of such building, for a period of ten years from the commencement of the Act or
from the date on which the building is constructed, whichever is later, except with the previous
permission of the competent authority. Sub-section 151 thereof again gives the first option to the
competent authority to purchase such land and at a price either as agreed upon between the
competent authority and the land-holder or where there is no such agreement at a price to be
calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or any other
corresponding law for the time being in force. It is only if the option is not exercised within sixty
days or the competent authority has not refused permission to sell the land that the holder of the
land can legally transfer the same to whomsoever he may like. These provisions of Section 27 also
militate against the conferment of the power on the State Government to permit exemption of land
for the purpose of its transfer for the same ‘reasons as are based on the provisions of Section 26
discussed above. The provisions of Section 27 refer to any urban or urbanisable land with a building.
The vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit may be with or without a building. In fact, the
provisions of Section 27 directly negative the conferment of such power, for the said provisions
show, firstly, that the legislature did not want the sale of any urban or urbanisable land with a
building whether it is within or without the ceiling limit except in accordance with the provisions of
Section 27. For Section 27 speaks of transfer of any urban or urbanisable land with a building or a
portion only of such building, only with the permission of the competent authority and on the terms
mentioned therein. This Court, as stated earlier, has invalidated the provisions of the said section to
the extent they apply to the vacant land with a building when the land is within the ceiling limit. But
it does apply to land in excess of the ceiling limit and with a building or a portion of it thereon. It is
not possible to hold that there are two provisions, viz. Section 20 ill (b) and Section 27 operating at
the same time in the same area. For the land permitted to be transferred under Section 20 [1] (b)
may also be a land with a building or a portion of a building thereon. In one case the restriction
imposed by Section 27 on the transfer would not apply and the State Government will be deemed to
have been given power to permit the sale even in contravention of the provisions of Section 27. In
another case, the holder of similar land will have to suffer the restrictions placed by Section 27.
There is nothing either in Section 20 [1] (b) or Section 27 to exclude the operation of the section, as
pointed out earlier. Eighthly, the provisions of Section 28 require a special procedure to be followed
by the registering officer under the Registration Act, 1908 while registering documents under
Section 17 [1] (a) to (e) of that Act when the transfer of the land is either under Section 26 or Section
27. Section 28 does not make any reference to the transfer permitted by the State Government
under Section 20 [1] (b). In other words, the holder of the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 27S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

has not to face the restriction on the registration of the document of transfer of his land provided
under Section 28 when such transfer is permitted by the State Government under Section 20 [1] (b),
whereas the holder of similar lend who does not approach the State Government has to suffer the
same when he transfers the land held by him. The discrimination between the transfers under the
different provisions is irrational and has no nexus with the object ought to be achieved by the
classification. Lastly, if the power to exempt the land for sale is read in Section 20 [1] (b) with such
conditions as the State Government may choose to place and if either the State Government chooses
not to place any conditions or to place such conditions as are inconsistent with the provisions of
Sections 29 and 30, it would create two sets of lands-one where no restriction are applicable to the
construction thereon or only such restrictions as the State Government may choose to impose, and
the other where the restrictions on constructions as provided by Sections 29 and 30 would be
applicable.

It is, therefore, more than clear that the provisions of Section 20 (11 (b) do not permit the State
Government to exempt vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit for the purposes of transfer.

N.P. SINGH, J. I agree with brother Sawant, J. that it is not possible to hold that State Government
can grant exemption under Section 20 [1] (b) of the Act, to the holder of the excess vacant land, so
that he may transfer the same in the manner he desires. The object of the Act being imposition of
ceiling on vacant land in urban agglomerations and for acquisition of such land in excess of ceiling
limit, with a view to prevent the concentration of urban land in the hands of a few persons,
speculations and profiteering therein, will that object be not defeated if it is held that power under
Section 20(1) of the Act can be exercised by the State Government to exempt the excess vacant
lands, from the application of Chapter III of the Act, so that the holder thereof can transfer such
lands? Sub-section (1) of section 20 is in two parts. The exemption under clause (a) of the said
sub-section is to be granted in the public interest whereas under clause (b) the exemption is to be
granted taking into consideration the "undue hardship" of the holder of the land in excess of the
ceiling limit. Both the expressions "public interest" and "undue hardship" are com- prehensive in
nature. But at the same time, it is not easy even for courts to say as to whether under different
circumstances the exemption was in the "public interest" or was necessary in the interest of the
holder of the .land because of his "undue hardship".

Under Indian conditions expression "undue hardship" is normally related to economic hardship.
That is why from time to time many holders of lands in excess of the ceiling limit, while claiming
exemption under clause (b) put forth their bad economic condition and indebtedness to claim
exemption along with permission to sell such excess lands. In the modern set up many holders of
such excess lands having undertaken commercial or industrial ventures with the help of the loans
from the Banks and other financial institutions, put the plea of repayment of such loans as undue
hardship for claiming exemption under clause (b) of section 20(1) aforesaid. How the holders of
excess lands having incurred losses or having failed to discharge their debts can claim exemption on
the ground of "undue hardship" in such a situation? Section 4 while fixing the ceiling limit, under
subsection (3) takes note of the fact that "where in respect of any vacant land any scheme for group
housing has been sanctioned by an authority competent in this behalf immediately before the
commencement of this Act, then, the person holding such vacant land at such commencement shall

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 28S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

be entitled to continue to hold such land for the purpose of group housing". But at the same time
under sub-section (4) of section 4 it has been specified that "if on or after the 17th day of February,
1975, but before the appointed day, any person has made any transfer by way of sale, mortgage, gift,
lease or otherwise (other than a bona fide sale under a registered deed for valuable consideration) of
any vacant land held by him and situated in such State to any other person, whether or not for
consideration, then, for the purposes of calculating the extent of vacant land held by such person the
land so transferred shall be taken into account, without prejudice to the rights or interests of the
transferee in the land so transferred". Similarly in section 5 it has been provided that "where any
person who had held vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit at any time during the period
commencing on the appointed day and ending with the commencement of this Act, has transferred
such land or part thereof by way of sale, mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise, the extent of the land so
transferred shall also be taken into account in calculating the extent of vacant land held by such
person". When different provisions take into consideration the lands already transferred by the
holder, (i) between the period 17th February, 1975 and the appointed day; (ii) as well as between the
period commencing from the appointed day and ending with the commencement of the Act, it
should not be easily inferred that the framers of the Act desired that after the commencement of the
Act while exercising the power of exemption under section 20(1)(b) permission should be granted to
holders of such excess lands to transfer such lands to third parties in order to meet their financial
liabilities.

Section 21 is yet another provision in the Act under which excess vacant land is not to be treated as
excess. Under the said Section exemption is to be granted in respect of such excess vacant land, if
the holder undertakes to utilise the same for the constructions of dwelling units for accommodation
of the weaker sections of the society in accordance with the scheme approved by the competent
authority or the State Government subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed. If
Section 21 provides for granting exemption in respect of excess land held by the holder only on a
specific condition that the holder shall utilise the same for the construction of dwelling units for
weaker section, to serve a public cause, how the framers of the Act could have conceived the grant of
exemption under Section 20(1)

(b) to the holder of the excess land, only to serve his interest, by selling such excess lands.

If it is held that the State Government can exempt the vacant land held by the land holder in excess
of the ceiling limit, from the applicability of the provisions of Chapter III of the Act, in order that the
said holder sells such land to liquidate his debts which amounts to an "undue hardship", then there
will be an apparent conflict between the interest of the land holder and the public interest. In the
interest of the land holder the maximum price fetched by sale of such land will be the solution of his
hardship, whereas that will run counter to the object of the Act to prevent " speculations and
profiteering". It is futile to urge that even in such transfers the dominant purpose of the legislation
to prevent "the concentration of urban land in hands of few persons" is none the less served. The
concentration of urban land in hands of few persons has to be prevented with a view to bring about
"an equitable distribution of land in urban agglomerations to subserve the common good". Section
23 prescribes the priorities for disposal or distribution of excess vacant lands after such lands vest in
the State under the provisions of the Act. In the case of Bhim Singhji v. Union of India, [1981] 1 SCC

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 29S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

166, it has been said:
"The definition of the word ‘industry’ in clause (b) of the Explanation to that section
is undoubtedly unduly wide since it includes "any business, profession, trade,
undertaking or manufacture". If sub-section (1) of Section 23 were to stand alone, no
doubt could have arisen that the Urban Land Ceiling Act is a facade of a social welfare
legislation and that its true, though concealed, purpose Is to benefit favored private
individuals or associations of individuals. But the preponderating provision
governing the disposal of excess vacant land acquired under the Act is the one
contained in sub-section (4) of Section 23 whereby all vacant lands deemed to have
been acquired by the State Government under the Act "shall be disposed of ... to
subserve the common good". The provisions of sub-section (4) are "subject to the
provisions of sub-sections (1), (2) and (3)" but the provisions of sub-section (1) are
enabling and not compulsive and those of sub-sections (2) and (3) are incidental to
the provisions of sub-section (1). The disposal of excess vacant lands must therefore
be made strictly in accordance with the mandate of sub-section (4) of Section 23,
subject to this, that in a given case such land may be allotted to any person, for any
purpose relating to, or in connection with, any 'industry' or for the other purposes
mentioned in sub-section (1), provided that by such allotment, common good will be
subserved. The governing test of disposal of excess land being 'social good’, any
disposal in any particular case or cases which does not subserve that purpose will be
liable to be struck down as being contrary to the scheme and intendment of the Act."

If the vacant lands which have vested in the State are also to be disposed of strictly keeping in view
the spirit and object of the Act, how under section 20(1)(b) exemption can be granted to holders of
such lands to dispose of such lands in the manner they like, the persons they prefer, the price they
dictate, for clearing their debts? If it is conceded that indebtedness amounts to an undue hardship,
then it may cover the debts incurred even after the commencement of the Act. The ceiling limit has
been fixed by section 3 with reference to the date of the commencement of the Act, but exception
can be granted till such excess lands vest in the State Government under sub-section (3) of section
10, after publication of the notification, in terms of the said sub- section. Although it was not
possible even for the framers of the Act to exhaustively indicate as to what shall be deemed to be
"undue hardship" within the meaning of section 20(1)(b) but it would have been better, if it had
been illustratively indicated, leaving the rest for the courts to decide.

20.1 have made no reference to Section 26 or Section 27 of the Act, while considering the question
whether on the ground of "undue hardship" the holder of the excess vacant land can be granted
exemption and then permission to sell such excess land, because he is financially crippled or
burdened with liabilities. In the case of Blim Singhji v. Union of India (supra) this court held that
Section 27(1) in so far as it imposes restriction on transfer of any urban or urbanisable land with a
building or of a portion of such building which is within ceiling area, was invalid. The said
sub-section (1) of Section 27 was struck down being unconstitutional. Section 26 of the Act also
imposes certain restrictions on transfer of vacant land even within ceding limit. It can be urged that
Section 26(1) suffers from the same vice which was pointed out in respect of sub-section (1) of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1982415/ 30S.Vasudeva Etc. Etc vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 30 March, 1993

Section 27 of Act, in the aforesaid case of bhim Singhji v. Union of India (supra) by this Court. But
neither in the aforesaid case nor in this case this court was or is concerned with Section 26 and as
such, according to me, it is not necessary to express any opinion in respect of Section 26 of the Act,
while considering the issue involved in the present appeals. ORDER

21.For the reasons given by us above, we are of view that the provisions of Section 20 [1] (b) of the
Act do not permit the State Government to give exemption to the vacant in excess of the ceiling limit
for the purposes of transferring the same.

22.In view of our conclusion as above, it is not necessary to go into the further question, viz., if the
State Government has such power, in which circumstances it can be exercised and whether financial
hardship such as the indebtedness of the land-holder is sufficient to warrant such exemption or not
and with respect to which date such indebtedness is to be assessed and in what manner, and
whether in the present case, the said aspects of the indebtedness were investigated or properly
investigated or not. For this very reason, we also do not propose to go into the other question
regarding the mala fides on the part of the authorities while granting permission to the firm to sell
the land to the builders in question.

23, Since we have come to the conclusion that the State Government has no power to grant
permission to sell the land under Section 20 [1] (b), the orders dated 6.3.87 and 18.4.87 granting
exemption and permission to the firm for sale of the land are void ab initio having been passed
without jurisdiction. Accordingly, the sale-deed dated 30.9.1987 executed by the 2nd respondent
firm in favour of the 3rd respondent-builders is held invalid and inoperative, as the respondent-firm
had no legal right to transfer the land in favour of the builders. We accordiigly allow the appeals and
set aside the impugned order of the High Court. The respondents State of Karnataka, M/s.
Narayanaswamy & Sons and M/s. Reevajethu, Builders & Developers will pay the costs to the
appellants in one set.

Leave granted in the Special Leave Petition.

The core question involved in these writ petitions and appeal centres round the constitutional
validity of reservation whether based on domicile or institution in the matter of admission into Post
Graduate Courses in government run medical colleges.

For determination of the said question factual matrix of the matter, is being noticed from Writ
Petition (Civil) No.29 of 2003.

The petitioners who are 52 in number are original residents of Delhi. They joined various medical
colleges out of Delhi for undertaking their MBBS Courses of studies against the 15% all-India quota
on being qualified therefore in the All India Medical Entrance Examination.

The appellants intended to join the medical colleges of Delhi for their Post Graduate Medical
Courses. They applied for and were granted admission forms having regard to the decision of this
Court in Dr. Parag Gupta v. University of Delhi and Ors., In the Bulletin of Information issued by the
University of Delhi, it was stated, that Candidates like the appellants would be entitled for admission
in Post Graduate Courses subject to the decision of a matter pending in this Court, i.e. Magan
Mehrotra and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. since reported in (2003)3 SCALE 101.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 1Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Magan Mehrotra (supra) inter alia, therein held that apart
from institutional preference, no other preference including reservation on the basis of residence is
envisaged in the Constitution, in view of the decision of this Court in Dr. Pradeep Jain and Ors. v.
Union of India and Ors.

The Delhi University on or about 31.12.2002 relying on or on the basis of the decision of this Court
in Magan Mehrotra (supra) issued the following notification :

"In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India dated 17.12.2002 in Writ Petition
(C) No. 417 of 2002. It is hereby notified that for admission of P.G. Courses during the Academic
Session 2003, only Delhi University Medical Graduates would be eligible against the 75% reserved
seats of the students from Delhi who have taken admission in the University/States under the 15%
All-India quota will not be eligible to seek admission in the P.O. Degree/Diploma Courses of Delhi
University against the 75% Reserve Seats. All concern may please be note.

Accordingly the students who have done MBBS under 15% All-India quota from the
University/States other than Delhi University and have applied for admission to the P.G.
Degree/Diploma Courses are not eligible to appear in P.G. Medical Entrance Test 2003 to be held
on 9.2.2003. They are advised to apply for the return of the Bank Draft/Cheque."

The appellants claiming themselves to be "the residents of Delhi" and "sons of the soil" filed the writ
petition in the court questioning the aforementioned notification dated 31.12.2002 as also
reservation made by way of institutional preference for admission to Post Graduate Medical
Courses.

A Division Bench of this Court having regard to the decision in Magan Mehrotra's case (supra)
which was rendered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court, referred the matter to a Bench of three
Judges by order dated 3.2.2003. However, when the matter was placed before a three-Judge Bench,
it by an order dated 7.2.2003 directed the matter to be placed before a Bench of five Judges
considering the importance of the matter; but no reason was assigned therefore.

The question which was initially raised in the writ petition was as to whether reservation made by
way of institutional preference is ultra vires Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India; but
during hearing a larger issue viz. as to whether any reservation, be on residence or institutional
preference is constitutionally permissible; was raised at the Bar.

In view of the importance of the question involved, this Bench in terms of order dated 1.4.2003
directed issuance of notice to all the States and Union Territories. Pursuant whereto, except State of
A.P. and State of Jammu & Kashmir all the States filed their returns and were heard.

Shri Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants raised two
contentions in support of the writ petition. He submitted that in view of the equality clause
contained in Articles 14 and 15(1) of the Constitution of India, reservation whether based on
domicile or institutional preference would be unconstitutional. The learned counsel took us through

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 2Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

the decisions of this Court operating in the field and urged that in view of the passage of time no
reservation should be permitted either on the basis of residence or on institutional preference.
Reservation on residential criteria, the learned counsel contended, is squarely hit by Clause (1) of
Article 15 of the Constitution of India. Placing reliance on the debates on the subject at the time of
framing of the Constitution. Shri Salve urged that the 'place of birth' being synonymous with
‘domicile’ the observations made contrary thereto in D.P. Joshi v. The State of Madhya Bharat and
Anr. are not correct.

Shri Salve further contended that in terms of the constitutional scheme, reservation is permissible
only when there exist compelling Government objectives therefore and that too on nominal basis if
it can be demonstrated that 'rule of merit’ should not be allowed to be sustained and when the class
in whose favour a departure is sought to be made constitutes a homogeneous group and such
departure satisfies the tests of social justice for securing equality upon comparison of such disability
suffered by such class or group of persons. The learned counsel submitted that in the matter of
reservation the State must scrupulously follow the requirements of Clause (4) of Article 15 of the
Constitution of India, namely, that the same is needed for the weaker section of society or a
homogeneous class and identified by a presidential order issued in that behalf.

In a case involving higher education even, Shri Salve argued, such a provision must be handled with
care and keeping in view a large number of decisions of this Court including M.R. Balaji and Ors. v.
State of Mysore not more than 50% of the total seats can be reserved. The learned counsel would
contend that if such reservation is prima facie impermissible having regard to the constitutional
scheme the same would fall within the purview of 'suspected classification’ and, thus, must pass the
‘strict scrutiny test’ or 'intermediate scrutiny test'. Any executive order providing for such
reservation, the learned counsel urged, must be construed having regard to the preamble, the
fundamental rights of the citizens and in particular Article 19(1)(d), as also the Directive Principles
of the State Policy as contained in Part IV of the Constitution of India and in particular Articles 41
and 47 of the Constitution of India. It was argued that meritorious students suffer from lack of
mobility as contra distinguished from the mobility of the employees, and are required to be
protected so as to suffer any discrimination only on a specious plea of the State "our money, our
people". Domicile of all the citizens of India, Shri Salve urged, should be one; as the concept of State
domicile has no role to play in our constitutional scheme. He emphasized that keeping the same in
view, a profile check is required to be made so far as meritorious students are concerned, as those
who are born and brought up in small towns also would like to have higher education in the
metropolitan towns where having regard to the better infrastructures and higher resources, the
institution therein would provide a better academic pursuit for them. In terms of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India, Shri Salve argued, students cannot form different class nor any such
classification made amongst them would be in public interest. Relying heavily upon the observations
made in paragraph 10 of the judgment of this Court in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra), the learned
counsel submitted that as all students are entitled to equal opportunities all sorts of reservations
must be given a go bye.

The learned counsel next contended that in any event, the students like the appellants should not be
held to have lost their residential status only because they had gone out of their State of origin for

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 3Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

pursuing their MBBS Course for a period of five years.

According to Shri Salve, Magan Mehrotra (supra), does not lay down the correct law and it is
required to be overruled.

Assailing reservation by way of institutional preference, Shri Salve, further submitted that the very
premise upon which it, is based is fallacious inasmuch as the majority of students, in view of the
decision of this Court in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra) having taken admission on the criteria of
domicile alone, would again be considered for pursuing their Post Graduate Studies only on that
basis and, thus, reservation by way of institutional preference would amount to indirect way of
doing things as the same would for all intent and purport would be based on domicile and, thus, is
liable to (sic) Shri Salve further contended that Delhi University or the States were required to place
before this Court sufficient materials to prove that such classification on institutional preference is
based on an intelligible differentia. Drawing our attention to the statements made in the counter
affidavit, the learned counsel urged that no such material has been placed except that the said
practice is in vogue for a long time.

Shri R.F. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of some of the students of All India
Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) submitted that in view of the decision of this Court in All
India Institute of Medical sciences Students Union v. All India Institute of Medical Sciences and
Ors., out of 40 students only 6 were offered admission in non-clinical subjects which the most of the
students would not like to pursue, Shri Nariman urged that plight of the students of AIIMS should
be considered having regard to the stand taken by or the practice prevalent in other Universities,
namely, institutional preference and in that view of the matter the students of the institution are
also entitled to equal opportunity to compete with the students of other Universities.

Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the students of Delhi University,
on the other hand, submitted that Magan Mehrotra's case (supra) has correctly been decided. The
learned counsel contended that keeping in view the decisions of this Court e.g. D.P. Joshi (supra),
Dr. Jagadish Saran and Ors. v. Union of India and Pradeep Jain (supra), it must be held that
reservation by way institutional preference has held the field for a long time. The impugned
notification, Shri Shanti Bhushan urged, having been issued pursuant to the directions of this Court,
it is futile to urge that the action on the part of Delhi University in following the same has resulted in
arbitrariness. According to the learned counsel reservation by way of institutional preference is not
only a matter of convenience but also forms part of the educational policy. If such a policy is not
allowed to have a little play, a student while undergoing different courses of studies may have to take
admissions in different parts of the country wherefor he would face problems involving different
languages, different cultures and different environments. It may not be feasible even for the parents
of middle class family to send their children out of the State. Furthermore, the learned counsel
contended that the chances that the local students would serve the local people cannot be
completely ruled out and, thus, such a criteria cannot be said to be illogical or bad in law.

As regard application of strict scrutiny test, Shri Shanti Bhushan relying on or on the basis of the
decision in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice S.R. Tendolkar and Ors. [1959 SCR 279] submitted

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 4Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

that this Court has laid down the law that the constitutionality of a statute must be presumed and
onus to prove that the statute is unconstitutional is upon the person who asserts the same. Only two
tests, namely, as to whether the classification is reasonable and based on an intelligible differentia
stood the test of time and there is no reason to deviate therefrom. Shri Shanti Bhushan argued that
reservation by way of institutional preference had been holding the field since this Court decided Dr.
Pradeep Jain's case (supra) and nothing has been pointed out by the petitioners to show that the
said principle should be departed from.

Shri A. Mariarputham, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Delhi University, supplementing the
arguments of Shri Shanti Bhushan, submitted that reservation by way of institutional preference is a
definite and identifiable criteria and in that view of the matter it satisfies the test of valid
classification as contained in Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The reasons assigned in support
of the institutional preference in various decisions of this Court are still relevant and as such there
being no change in the situation, any fresh look or reconsideration thereof is not warranted. This
Court, the learned counsel urged that having framed a scheme in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra)
which is binding on all concerned in view of the provisions contained in Articles 141, 142, 143 and
144 of the Constitution of India, may not depart therefrom in view of the fact that this Court in
Magan Mehrotra's case (supra) upon issuance of notice to all States had clearly directed that the law
relating to institutional preference laid down in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra) should be followed
and in particular directed that the States of Assam, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Goa to follow
reservation by way of institutional preference alone.

The learned counsel contended that all the States have since amended their rules so as to consider
the candidature of those students who had studied in any of the institutions situated in that State on
15% all India quota and in that view of the matter the said students do not require a further
indulgence. According to the learned counsel apart from the fact that the students who had gone to
pursue their MBBS courses outside the State are entitled to take part in all India open competition,
they having regard to the amendments made in the rules framed by the States of Karnataka, Assam
and others being entitled to institutional preference in the State where they had studied, may not be
held to be entitled to a further indulgence of competing with the students of Delhi University in 75%
quota on the ground that they are residents of Delhi and thereby bringing back the concept of
reservation on domicile indirectly again.

Shri Sanjay Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Karnataka, Shri A. Phukan,
learned counsel appearing for the State of Assam and Shri R.S. Suri, learned counsel appearing for
the State of Punjab, however, submitted that the States should be allowed to set apart some seats for
the local candidates. It was pointed out that unlike other studies Post Graduate Medical Courses
involve practical training and the students are required to work in the hospitals wherein they are
paid stipends by the States. It was urged that the States have been finding it extremely difficult to
get good number of local doctors to serve the rural population and, thus, such a criteria, according
to the learned counsel, cannot be said to be unconstitutional.

Before we embark upon the questions raised at the Bar, we may notice that the States before the
decision of this Court in Dr. Parag Gupta's case (supra) had been following different criteria as

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 5Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

regard grant of preference i.e. either on institution basis or on residence basis or both. The positions
prevailing in different States before and after Dr. Parag Gupta's case (supra) and at present are given
as under :

Pradeep Jain's case (supra), notices had been issued to all the States and all of them were fully
heard. But despite the same, the orders passed by this Court in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra) had
been flouted with impunity, inter alia, by the States of Assam, Karnataka, Goa and Tamil Nadu. Now
it transpires that even the State of Punjab has also not been following the said decision.

The necessity of issuing notices by this Court again in Magan Mehrotra's case (supra) must be
considered from that angle. In Magan Mehrota's case (supra), this Court not only reiterated that the
reservation by way of institutional preference be maintained but also directed the aforementioned
States to follow the same.

The questions must, therefore, be considered in the aforementioned factual backdrop.

The first question that arises for consideration is, whether the reservation on the basis of domicile is
impermissible in terms of Clause (1) of Article 15 of the Constitution of India ? The term 'place of
birth' occurs in Clause (1) of Article 15 but not 'domicile'. If a comparison is made between Article
15(1) and Article 16(2) of the Constitution of India, it would appear that whereas the former refers to
‘place of birth' alone, the latter refers to both ‘domicile’ and 'residence' apart from place of birth. A

distinction, therefore, has been made by the makers of the Constitution themselves to the effect that

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 8Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

the expression ‘place of birth’ is not synonymous to the expression "domicile" and they reflect two
different concepts. It may be true, as has been pointed out by Shri Salve and pursued by Mr.
Nariman, that both the expressions appeared to be synonymous to some of the members of the
Constituent Assembly but the same, in our opinion, cannot be a guiding factor. In D.P. Joshi's case
(supra), a Constitution Bench held so in no uncertain terms.

This Bench is bound by the said decision.
In State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. v. Pradip Tandon and Ors. this Court observed:

"The reservation for rural areas cannot be sustained on the ground that the rural areas represent
socially and educationally backward classes of citizens. This reservation appears to be made for the
majority population of the State. Eighty per cent of the population of the State cannot be a
homogeneous class. Poverty in rural areas cannot be the basis of classification to support
reservation for rural areas. Poverty, is found in all parts of India, In the instructions for reservation
of seats it is provided that in the application form a candidate for reserved seats from rural areas
must submit a certificate of the District Magistrate of the District to which he belonged that he was
born in rural areas and had a permanent home there, and is residing there or that he was born in
India and his parents and guardians are still living there and earn their livelihood there. The
incident of birth in rural areas is made the basic qualification. No reservation can be made on the
basis of place of birth, as this would offend Article 15."

Answer to the said question must, therefore, be rendered in the negative.

The second question that arises for our consideration is, whether reservation by way of institutional
preference comes within suspected classification warranting strict scrutiny test ?

Once it is held that Clause (1) of Article 15 of the Constitution of India is not attracted, the only
question which survives is as to whether the same attracts the wrath of Article 14 of the Constitution
of India. Article 14 forbids class legislation but permits reasonable classification subject to the
conditions that it is based on an intelligible differentia and that the differentia must have a rational
relation to the object sought to be achieved.

In Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia's case (supra), this Court categorically held:

",..It is now well established that while Article 14 forbids class legislation, it does not forbid
reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of
permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) that the classification must be
founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped
together from others left out of the group and, (ii) that that differentia must have a rational relation
to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question. The classification may be founded on
different bases, namely, geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like. What is
necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act
under consideration. It is also well established by the decisions of this Court that article 14

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 9Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

condemns discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law of procedure."

The principle enunciated above has been consistently adopted and applied in subsequent cases. The
decisions of this Court further establish

(a) that a law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual if, on account of
some special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and not applicable to others, that single
individual may be treated as a class by himself:

(b) that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the
burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the
constitutional principles;

(c) that it must be presumed that the legislature understands and corruptly appreciates the need of
(sic) problems made manifest by experience and that its discrimination's are based on adequate
grounds;

(d) that the legislature is free to recognise degrees of harm and may confine its restrictions to those
cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest;

(e) that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the court may take into
consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of common report, the history of the times
and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation; and

(f) that while good faith and knowledge of the existing conditions on the part of a legislature are to
he presumed, if there is nothing on the face of the law or the surrounding circumstances brought to
the notice of the court on which the classification may reasonably be regarded as based, the
presumption of constitutionally cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that there must be
some undisclosed and unknown reasons for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile
or discriminating legislation.

The above principles will have to be constantly borne in mind by the court when it is called upon to
adjudge the constitutionality of any particular law attacked as discriminatory and violative of the
equal protection of the laws."

The strict scrutiny test or the intermediate scrutiny test applicable in the United States of America as
argued by Shri Salve cannot be applied in this case. Such a test is not applied in Indian Courts. In
any event, such a test may be applied in a case where a legislation ex facie is found to be
unreasonable. Such a test may also be applied in a case where by reason of a statute the life and
liberty of a citizen is put in jeopardy. This Court since its inception apart from a few cases where the
legislation was found to be ex facie wholly unreasonable proceeded on the doctrine that
constitutionality of a statute is to be presumed and the burden to prove contra is on him who asserts
the same. The courts always lean against a construction which reduces the statute to a futility. A
statute or any enacting provision therein must be so construed as to make it effective and operative

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 10Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

"on the principle expressed in the maxim : ut res magis valeat quam pereat”. [See CIT v. Teja Singh
and Tinsukhia Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam].

Applying the test of presumption of constitutionality no case has been made out for invoking the
doctrine of strict construction or intermediate construction.

The third question that arises for our consideration is, whether the reservation by institutional
preference is valid? India is one country and all its citizens should equally be treated. The essence of
equality is enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India. But does it mean that equality clause
must be applied to all citizens to all situations? It is true that the country should strive to achieve a
goal of excellence which in turn would mean that meritorious students should not be denied pursuit
of higher studies. This itself brings us the question, who is to judge the merit and what are the
standards therefor? It is extremely difficult to lay down a fool- proof criteria. Success or failure of a
candidate in one examination or the other may not lead to infallible conclusion as regard the merit
of a candidate so as to achieve excellence. The larger question, therefore, would be how to and to
what extent balance should be struck.

Ideal situation, although it might have been to see that only meritorious students irrespective of
caste, creed, sex, place of birth, domicile/residence are treated equally but history is replete with
situations to show that India is not ready therefore. Sociological condition prevailing in India
compelled the makers of the Constitution to bring in Articles 15 and 16 in the Constitution. The said
Articles for all intent and purport are species of Article 14 which is the genies in a sense that they
provide for exception to the equality clause also. Preference to a class of persons whether based on
caste, creed, religion, place of birth, domicile or residence is embedded in- cur constitutional
scheme. Whereas larger interest of the country must be perceived, the law makers cannot shut their
eyes to the local needs also. Such local needs must receive due consideration keeping in view the
duties of the State contained in Articles 41 and 47 of the Constitution of India.

(Emphasis mine) For the last five decades this Court times without number had adopted the efficacy
of one catena or the other for giving preference to a section of students.

Constitutional interpretation is a difficult task. Its concept varies from statute to statute, fact to fact,
situation to situation and subject matter to subject matter. Perceptions are yet to be perceived by the
court which would moot all situations while laying down emphasis for achieving excellence in all
spheres of life keeping in view Chapter IV-A of the Constitution of India which provide for
fundamental duties, circumstances and compulsions faced by the State in this behalf led the courts
to uphold a statute providing for reservation for a special class of people. Mostly they suffer from
disability either being belonging to an oppressed community or by way of economical, cultural or
social imbalances. The courts shall all along strive hard for maintaining a balance. While
interpreting the Constitution, we must notice the following view of Justice Holmes expressed in
Missouri v. Holland [252 US 416 (433)]:

"When we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United
States, we must realise that they have called into life a being the development of which could not

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 11Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realise
or to hope that they had created an organism, it has taken a century and has cost their successors
must sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in
the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago."

[Emphasis supplied] Equally important is an elucidation of Justice Frankfurter contained in an
article "Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes". This Court also in Jagadish Saran and Ors. v.
Union of India, a decision which is applicable in the fact situation of this case, stated the law thus :

"Law, constitutional law, is not an omnipotent abstraction or distant idealization but a principled,
yet pragmatic, value-laden and resulted-oriented, set of propositions applicable to and conditioned
by a concrete stage of social development of the nation and aspirational imperatives of the people.
India Today -- that is the inarticulate major premise of our constitutional law and life."

In D.P. Joshi's case (supra) advantage given to local residents as regard payment of capitation fee
was upheld. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Km. Chitra Ghosh and Anr. v. Union of India and
Ors. stated the law thus :

"It is the Central Government which bear's the financial burden of running the medical college. It is
for it to lay down the criteria for eligibility. From the very nature of things it is not possible to throw
the admission open to students from all over the country. The Government cannot be denied the
right to decide from what sources the admission will be made. That essentially is a question of policy
and depends inter, alia on an overall assessment and survey of the requirements of residents of
particular territories and other categories of persons for whom it is necessary to provide facilities for
medical education. If the sources are properly classified whether on territorial, geographical or other
reasonable basis it is not for the courts to interfere with the manner and method of making the
classification."

[Emphasis supplied] The matter came up for consideration again in D.N. Chanchala v. The State of
Mysore and Ors., M.R. Mini (Minor) represented by her Guardian and Father M.P. Rajappan v.
State of Kerala and Anr., wherein a similar note was struck.

In Dr. Jagadish Saran's case (supra) this Court had an occasion to consider the question as to
whether grant of institutional preference was a valid basis for admission. This case dealt with
admission in Post Graduate Courses of the Delhi. University, Krishna Iyer, J. with whom Pathak, J.
concurred in no uncertain terms upheld such preference.

A large number of decisions on the point were taken into consideration by this Court in Dr. Pradeep
Jain's case (supra). Upon a detailed analysis of the constitutional provisions, case laws as also the
practical difficulties faced by the States, students as also the institutions, it was held :

",..What is, therefore, necessary is to set up proper and adequate structures in rural areas where
competent medical services can be provided by doctors and some motivation must be provided to

the doctors servicing those areas. But, as the position stands today, there is considerable paucity of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 42Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

seats in medical colleges to satisfy the increasing demand of students for admission and some
principle has, therefore, to be evolved for making selection of students for admission to the medical
colleges and such principle has to be in conformity with the requirement of Article 14. Now, the
primary imperative of Article 14 is equal opportunity for all across the nation for education and
advancement and, as pointed out by Krishna Iyer, J. in Jagdish Saran v. Union of India "this has
burning relevance to our times when the country is gradually being ‘broken up into fragments by
narrow’ domestic walls' by surrender to narrow parochial loyalties". What is fundamental, as an
enduring value of our polity, is guarantee to each of equal opportunity to unfold the full potential of
his personality. Anyone anywhere, humble or high agrestic or urban, man or women, whatever be
his language or religion, place of birth or residence, is entitled to be afforded equal chance for
admission to any secular educational course for cultural growth, training facility, speciality or
employment. It wold run counter to the basic principle of equality before the law and equal
protection of the law if a citizen by reason of his residence in State A, which ordinarily in the
commonality of cases, would be the result of his birth in a place situate within that State, should
have opportunity for education or advancement which is denied to another citizen because he
happens to be resident in State B. It is axiomatic that talent is not the monopoly of the residents of
any particular State; it is more or less evenly distributed and given proper opportunity and
environment, everyone has a prospect of rising to the peak. What is necessary is equality of
opportunity and that cannot be made dependent upon where a citizen resides. If every citizen is
afforded equal opportunity, genetically and environmentally, to develop his potential, he will be able
in his own way to manifest his faculties fully leading to all round improvement in excellence. The
philosophy and pragmatism of universal excellence through equality of opportunity for education
and advancement across the nation is part of our founding faith and constitutional creed. The effort
must, therefore, always be to select the best and most meritorious students for admission to
technical institutions and medical colleges by providing equal opportunity to all citizens in the
country and no citizen can legitimately, without serious detriment to the unity and integrity of the
nation, be regarded as an outsider in our constitutional set-up. Moreover, it would be against
national interest to admit in medical colleges or other institutions giving instruction in specialities,
less meritorious students when more meritorious students are available, simply because the former
are permanent residents or residents for a certain number of years in the State while the latter are
not, though both categories are citizens of India. Exclusion of more meritorious students on the
ground that they are not resident within the State would be likely to promote substandard
candidates and bring about fall in medical competence, injurious in the long run to the very region.

"It is no blessing to inflict quacks and medical midgets on people by wholesale sacrifice of talent at
the threshold. Nor can the very best be rejected from admission because that will be a national loss
and the interests of no region can be higher than those of the nation." The primary consideration in
selection of candidates for admission to the medical colleges must, therefore, be merit. The object of
any rules which may be made for regulating admissions to the medical colleges must be to secure
the best and most meritorious students.""

But it was observed :

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 13Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

",,.Whether consistently with the constitutional values, admissions to a medical college or any other
institution of higher learning situate in a State can be confined to those who have their ‘domicile’
within the State or who are residents within the State for a specified number of years or can any
reservation in admission be made for them so as to give them precedence over those who do not
possess 'domicile' or residential qualification within the State, irrespective of merit..."

The right of development in a developing country is acknowledged in International Treaties,
Charters and Conventions.

Referring to the State mentality and pointing out to the law that there does not exist any separate
State domicile in India, this Court specifically banished the residential requirement for the purpose
of admission into Post Graduate Medical Courses for all times. It directed :

"So much for admission to the MBBS course, but different consideration must prevail when, we
come to consider the question of reservation based on residence requirement within the State or on
institutional preference for admission to the post-graduate courses, such as, MD, MS and the like.
There we cannot allow excellence to be compromised by any other considerations because that
would be detrimental to the interest of the nation. It was rightly pointed out by Krishna Iyer, J. in
Jagdish Saran case, and we wholly endorse what he has said :

The basic medical needs of a region or the preferential push justified for a handicapped group
cannot prevail in the same measure at the highest scales of speciality where the best skill or talent,
must be handpicked by selecting according to capability. At the level of PhD, MD, or levels of higher
proficiency, where intentional measure of talent is made, where losing one great scientist or
technologist in- the-making is a national loss, the considerations we have expanded upon as
important lose their potency. Here equality, measured by matching excellence, has more meaning
and cannot be diluted much without grave risk.

* * * Tf equality of opportunity for every person in the country is the constitutional guarantee, a
candidate who gets more marks than another is entitled to preference for admission. Merit must be
the test when choosing the best, according to this rule of equal chance for equal marks. This
proposition has greater importance when we reach the higher levels of education like post-graduate
courses. After all, top technological expertise in any vital field like medicine is a nation's human
asset without which its advance and development will be stunted. The role of high grade skill or
special talent may be less at the lesser levels of education, jobs and disciplines of social
inconsequence, but more at the higher levels of sophisticated skills and strategic employment. To
devalue merit at the summit is to temporise with the country's development in the vital areas of
professional expertise. In science and technology and other specialised fields of developmental
significance, to relax lazily or easily in regard to exacting standards of performance may be running
a grave national risk because in advanced medicine and other critical departments of higher
knowledge, crucial to material progress, the people of India should not be denied the best the
nation's talent lying latent can produce. If the best potential in these fields is cold-shouldered for
populist considerations garbed as reservations, the victims, in the long run, may be the people
themselves. Of course, this unrelenting strictness in selecting the best may not be so imperative at

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 14Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

other levels where a broad measure of efficiency may be good enough and what is needed is merely
to weed out the worthless.

* * * Secondly, and more importantly, it is difficult to denounce or renounce the merit criterion
when the selection is for postgraduate or post-doctoral courses in specialised subjects. There is no
substitute for sheer flair, for creative talent, for fine-tuned performance at the difficult heights of
some disciplines where the best alone is likely to blossom as the best. To sympathise mawkishly with
the weaker sections by selecting sub-standard candidates, is to punish society as a whole by denying
the prospect of excellence say in hospital sendee. Even the poorest, when stricken by critical illness,
needs the attention of super-skilled specialists, not humdrum second-rates. So it is that relaxation
on merit, by overruling equality and quality altogether, is a social risk where the stage is
post-graduate or post- doctoral.

These passages from the judgment of Krishna lyer, J. clearly and forcibly express the same view
which we have independently reached on our own and indeed that view has been so ably expressed
in these passages that we do not think we can usefully add anything to what has already been said
there. We may point out that the Indian Medical Council has also emphasized that playing with
merit so far as admissions to post-graduate courses are concerned, for pampering local feeling, will
boomerang. We may with advantage reproduce the recommendation of the Indian medical Council
on this point which may not be the last word in social wisdom but is certainly worthy of
consideration :

Students for post-graduate training should be selected strictly on merit judged on the basis of
academic record in the under graduate course. All selection for post-graduate studies should be
conduced by the Universities.

The Medical Education Review Committee has also expressed the opinion that "all admissions to the
post-graduate courses in any institution should be open to candidates on an all-India basis and
there should be no restriction regarding domicile in the State/Union Territory in which the
institution is located". So also in the policy statement filed by the learned Attorney-General, the
Government of India has categorically expressed the view that:

So far as admission to the institutions of post-graduate colleges and special professional colleges is
concerned, it should be entirely on the basis of all-India merit subject to constitutional reservations
in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

We are therefore of the view that so far as admissions to post- graduate courses, such as MS, MD
and the like are concerned, it would be eminently desirable not to provide for any reservation based
on residence requirement within the State or on institutional preference. But, having regard to
broader considerations of equality of opportunity and institutional continuity in education which
has its own importance and value, we would direct that though residence requirement within the
State shall not be a ground for reservation in admissions to post-graduate courses, a certain
percentage of seats may in the present circumstances, be reserved on the basis of institutional
preference in the sense that a student who has passed MBBS course from a medical college or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 15Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

university, may be given preference for admission to the post-graduate course in the same medical
college or university but such reservation on the basis of institutional preference should not in any
event exceed 50 per cent of the total number of open seats available for admission to the
post-graduate course. This outer limit which we are fixing will also be subject to revision on the
lower side by the Indian Medical Council in the same manner as directed by us in the case of
admission to the MBBS course. But, even in regard to admissions to the post-graduate course, we
would direct that so far as super specialities such as neuro-surgery and cardiology are concerned,
there should be no reservation at all even on the basis of institutional preference and admissions
should be granted purely on merit on all-India basis."

It in no uncertain terms directed :

"The decisions reached by us in these writ petitions will bind the Union of India, the State
Governments and Administrations of Union Territories because it lays down the law for the entire
country and moreover we have reached this decision after giving notice to the Union of India and all
the State Governments and Union Territories..."

Ascheme, thus, came to be framed by this Court which is a law within the meaning of Article 141 of
the Constitution of India and is binding-on all the States in terms of Article 144 of the Constitution
of India. The principal considerations which weighed with the court for arriving at the
aforementioned conclusion were:

"...There can be no doubt that the policy of ensuring admissions to the MBBS Course on all-India
basis is a highly desirable policy, based as it is on the postulate - that India is one nation and every
citizen of India is entitled to have equal opportunity for education and advancement, but it is an
ideal to be aimed at and it may not be realistically possible, in the present circumstances, to adopt it,
for it cannot produce real equality of opportunity unless, there is complete absence of disparities
and inequalities - a situation which simply does not exist in the country today. There are massive
social and economic disparities and inequalities not only between State and State but also between
region and region within a State and even between citizens and citizens within the same region.
There is a yawning gap between the rich and the poor and there are so many disabilities and
injustices from which the poor suffer as a class that they cannot avail themselves of any
opportunities which may in law be open to them. They do not have the social and material resources
to take advantage of these opportunities which remain merely on paper recognized by law but
nonexistent in fact. Students from backward States or regions will hardly be able to compete with
those from advanced States or regions because, though possessing an intelligent mind, they would
have had no adequate opportunities for development so as to be in a position to compete with
others. So also students belonging to the weaker sections who have not, by reason of their socially or
economically disadvantaged position, been able to secure education in good schools would be at a
disadvantage compared to students belonging to the affluent or well-to-do families who have had
the best of school education and in open all-India competition, they would be likely to be worsted..."

A distinction was made therefore between the Undergraduate Course i.e. MBBS Course and Post
Graduate Medical Course as also super speciality courses. The Court, therefore, sought to strike a

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 16Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

balance of rights and interests of all concerned.

However, the percentage of seats to be allotted on all-India basis, however, came to be modified in
Dr. Dinesh Kumar and Ors. v. Motilal Nehru Medical College, Allahabad and Ors. in the following
terms :
"We would also like to clear up one misunderstanding which seems to prevail with some State
Governments and universities in regard to the true import of our Judgment dated June 22, 1984.
They have misinterpreted our Judgment to mean that 30% of the total number of seats available for
admission to MBBS course in a medical college should be kept free from reservation on the basis of
residence requirement or institutional preference. That is a total misreading of our Judgment. What
we have said in our Judgment is that after providing for reservation validly made, whatever seats
remain available for non-reserved categories, 30% of such seats at the least, should be left free for
open competition and admission to such 30% open seats should not be based on residence
requirement or institutional preference but students from all over the country should be able to
compete for admissions to such 30% open seats. To take an example, suppose there are 100 seats in
a medical college or university and 30% of the seats are validly reserved for candidates belonging to
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. That would leave 70 seats available for others belonging to
non-reserved categories. According to our Judgment, 30% of 70 seats, that is, 21 seats out of 70 and
not 30% of the total number of 100 seats, namely, 30 seats, must be filled up by open competition
regardless of residence requirement or institutional preference."

Changes were made in the formula in Dr. Dinesh Kumar and Ors. (ID) v. Motilal Nehru Medical
College, Allahabad and Ors.. This Court thereafter times without number issued directions from
time to time regulating admissions in different courses of studies, meticulous supervisions and
conduct of examinations by the Universities as also all-India tests in the following :

1. Dr. Dinesh Kumar (IID) 
2. Dr. Dinesh Kumar (IV) 
3. Dr. Dinseh Kumar (V) - [(4989) Supp 2 SCC 428]

4. Dr. Dinseh Kumar (VI) - [(1987) 1 SCALE 1232]

5. Dr. Dinseh Kumar (VID - [(1987) 2 SCALE 22]

6. Dr. Dinseh Kumar (VIII - [(4988) 1 SCALE 428]

7. Dr. Dinseh Kumar (IX) 
The State of Assam, it appears, was specifically directed to follow institutional preference by this

Court by an order dated 2.2.1996 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 625 of 1995.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 17Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

A deviation to the said dicta, however, was sought to be made by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in
Dr. Parag Gupta's case (supra). In the said decision some of the students complained that whereas
the students who had undergone studies in other Universities were entitled to reservation by way of
domicile or institutional preference, but they, although had successfully completed in All India
Entrance Test in MBBS Course, are not being permitted to compete with their fellow students of
Delhi University on the ground of institutional preference, although they belong to the same class of
students.

This Court in Dr. Parag Gupta (supra) did not lay down any law. It dealt with the situation on
equitable and humanitarian grounds but while doing so it indisputably deviated from the law laid
down in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra) only by way of an interim arrangement. It inadvertently
created reservation on domicile which was forbidden in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra). The said
provisional directions being binding on Delhi University came to be followed in subsequent years.
The sympathetic consideration shown by this Court in Dr. Parag Gupta's case (supra) came to be
misapplied by the Allahabad High Court in Vineet Singh's case wherein the High Court directed
consideration of cases of the students who belonged to the State of U.P. irrespective of the fact that
whether they had gone out of their home State on 15% all-India quota or not. This Court in State of
U.P. and Ors. v. Vineet Singh and Ors. clarified the position holding that the High Court was wrong
in extending the benefit in Dr. Parag Gupta's case (supra) to other students and reiterated that Dr.
Parag Gupta's decision was confined to the students who had gone to other States under 15%
all-India quota. The ratio of the judgment in Dr. Parag Gupta's case (supra) came to be reiterated in
Abhinav Aggarwal and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. [(2001) 3 SCC 425].

In Dr. Prachi Almeida v. Dean, Goa Medical College and Ors., a problem was faced by a student from
Delhi who was admitted into Goa Medical College under the 15% all-India quota. She was denied
admission in Goa on the ground that she was not resident of the said State. She, however, was
married in Goa. This Court followed Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra) and directed that the student
cannot be denied admission on the basis of residence requirement holding that if the candidate has
done MBBS Course in that State such a candidate would be eligible for admission in Post Graduate
Medical Course therein.

Some students of the Delhi University, thereafter filed a writ petition questioning the residential
reservation in Magan Mehrotra and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. since reported in (2003) 3
SCALE 101. A Bench of this Court therein by an order dated 11.09.2002 noticing the conflict
between the decisions in Dr. Pradeep Jain (supra) on the one hand and Dr. Parag Gupta (supra) on
the other, issued notices to all the States excepting the States of Jammu & Kashmir and Andhra
Pradesh and referred the matter to a three-Judge Bench. In Magan Mehrotra (supra), this Court
held that the decision in Dr. Parag Gupta (supra) is contrary to the decision in Dr. Pradeep Jain
(supra) stating:

",..A bare look at the judgment. of the 3-JudgeBench in Pradeep Jain's case and two-Judge Bench in
Parag Gupta’'s case in relation to the question of preference in the post graduate course it cannot but
be held that the Parag Gupta's case took a different view by upholding the residential preference, in
essence, which was contrary to the judgment of the three-Judge Bench in Pradeep Jain's case.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 18Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

Independently on examining the 7 issue of preference, we are also of the considered opinion that the
decision rendered by this Court in Pradeep Jain's case had taken a correct criteria into consideration
and we therefore, agree with the principles evolved and the ratio given in Pradeep Jain's case so far
as it relates to admission into the post graduate courses and the question of institutional preference
to be given to those who had studied their under-graduate courses in the very institutions against
the 15% quota on the All India basis. In this view of the matter, the impugned Bulletin of
Information issued by the Delhi University in relation to the Post-doctoral (D.M./M.Ch.) Post
Graduate Degree must be held to be contrary to the direction of this Court in Pradeep Jain's case
and the same is accordingly quashed. However, this order shall be made effective from the next
academic session. We, however, direct the Sates of Assam, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Karnataka to follow
the pattern of institutional preference as has been indicated by this Court in Pradeep Jain's case and
reiterated by us today..."

We may, however, notice that this Court in K. Duraisamy and Anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors.
upheld the sources for admission by giving preference to the doctors working in the hospitals in the
Post Graduate Courses on the ground that the same constitutes a valid classification.

The discussions on this topic would remain incomplete if we fail to notice a recent decision of this
Court in All India Institute of Medical Sciences Students' Union (supra) rendered by one of us,
Hon'ble Lahoti, J. wherein this Court, keeping in view the peculiar situation obtaining in the case of
AIMS, held institutional reservation to be unconstitutional. It, however, keeping in view the
necessity of giving institutional preference to students who had studied from AIIMS, directed that
such preference be given to the extent of 25% of students instead of 33%. However, keeping in view
the fact that there were 40 seats in MBBS Course whereas 132 seats in Post Graduate Courses, the
institutional preference to be given to the students of AIIMS came to about 82.5%.

In this context it is relevant to examine the relevance of an entry in the State List or Concurrent List.

‘Education' appears both in Union List as also in the Concurrent List. The relevant entries in the
Constitution are as under :

"66. List I - Co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or
research and scientific and technical institutions."

"25. List III - Education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject
to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of labour."

An argument has been advanced that different interpretation is needed having regard to the shift of
constitutional entry from List II to List III. One of us in T.M.A. Pai Foundation and Ors. v. State of
Karnataka and Ors., had to say the following :

"Further, under Clause (2) of Article 246 Paliament and subject to Clause (1) the legislature of any
State are empowered to make law with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III Seventh

Schedule and under Clause (3) of Article 246, the legislature of any State is empowered to enact law

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 19Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule subject to Clauses
(1) and (2). From the aforesaid provisions it is clear that it is Article 246 and other articles which
either empower Parliament or the State Legislature to enact law and not the entries finding place in
three lists of the Seventh Schedule, Thus the function of entries in three lists of the Seventh
Schedule is to demarcate the area over which the appropriate legislatures can enact laws but do not
confer power either OB Parliament or the State Legislatures to enact laws. It may be remembered,
by transfer of the entries, the character of the entries is not lost or destroyed. In this view of the
matter by transfer of contents of Entry 11 of List II to List III as Entry 25 has not denuded the power
of the State Legislature to enact law on the subject "Education" but has also conferred power on

wn

Parliament to enact law on the subject "Education".
Shifting of the entry from the State List to the Concurrent List is not, thus, relevant inasmuch the
State in absence of any Parliamentary act has the legislative competence to enact a statute laying
down reservation for entry in any course of studies including the medical courses.

The sole question, therefore, is as to whether reservation by way of institutional preference is ultra
vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India. We think not. Article 14, it will bear repetition to state,
forbids class legislation but does not forbid reasonable classification, which means - (1) must be

based on reasonable and intelligible differentia; and (2) such differentia must be on rational basis.

Hence, we may also notice the argument, whether institutional reservation fulfils the
aforementioned criteria or not must be judged on the following :
1. There is a presumption of constitutionality;

2. The burden of proof is upon the writ petitioners as they have questioned the constitutionality of
the provisions;

3. There is a presumption as regard the State's power on extent of its legislative competence;
4. Hardship of few cannot be the basis for determining the validity of any statute.

The court while adjudicating upon the constitutionality of the provisions of the statute may notice
all relevant facts whether existing or conceived.

This Court may therefore notice the following :

(i) The State runs the Universities.

(ii) It has to spend a lot of money in imparting medical education to the students of the State.

(iii) Those who get admission in Post Graduate Courses are also required to be paid stipends.

Reservation of some seats to a reasonable extent, thus, would not violate the equality clause.

(iv) The criteria for institutional preference has now come to stay. It has worked out satisfactorily in
most of the States for last about two decades.

(v) Even those States which defied the decision of this Court in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra) had
realized the need for institutional preference.

(vi) No sufficient material has been brought on record for departing from this well-established
admission criteria.

(vii) It goes beyond any cavil of doubt that institutional preference is based on a reasonable and
identifiable classification. It may be that while working out the percentage of reservation invariably
some local students will have preference having regard to the fact that domicile/residence was one
of the criteria for admission in MBBS Course. But together with the local students 15%, students
who had competed in all India Entrance Examination would also be getting the same benefit. The
percentage of students who were to get the benefit of reservation by way of institutional preference
would further go down if the decision of this Court in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra) is scrupulously
followed.

(viii) Giving of such a preference is a matter of State policy which can be invalidated only in the
event of being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

(ix) The students who would get the benefit of institutional preference being on identifiable ground,
there is hardly any scope

(x) for manipulation.
In Km. N. Vasundara v. State of Mysore and Anr. [(1971) 1 Supp. SCR 381], it was observed :

"But cases of hardship are likely to arise in the working of almost any rule which may be framed for
selecting a limited number of candidates for admission out of a long list. This, however, would not
render the rule unconstitutional."

As noticed hereinbefore, in D.N. Chanchala's case (supra), M.R. Mini's case (supra) and Jagadish
Saran's case (supra) institutional preference has been preferred. It has been reiterated in the law
laid down by way of a scheme evolved in Dr. Pradeep Jain (supra) and reiterated in Magan Mehrotra
(supra).

We, therefore, do not find any reason to depart from the ratio laid down by this Court in Dr. Pradeep
Jain (supra). The logical corollary of our finding is that reservation by way of institutional
preference must be held to be not offending Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

However, the test to uphold the validity of a statute on equality must be judged on the touch-stone
of reasonableness. It was noticed in Dr. Pradeep's Jain's case (supra) that reservation to the extent

of 50% was held to be reasonable. Although subsequently in Dr. Dinesh Kumar's case (supra) it was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 21Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

reduced to 25% of the total seats. The said percentage of reservation was fixed keeping in view the
situation as then existing. The situation has now changed to a great extent. Twenty years have
passed. The country has during this time have produced a large number of Post Graduate doctors.
Our Constitution is organic in nature. Being a living organ, it is ongoing and with the passage of
time, law must change. Horizons of constitutional law arc expanding.

Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that the original
scheme as framed in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case (supra) should be reiterated in preference to Dr.
Dinesh Kumar's case (supra). Reservation by way of institutional preference, therefore, should be
confined to 50% of the seats since it is in public interest.

For the purpose of selecting the candidates, it is necessary to hold an All India Entrance
Examination by an impartial and reputed body. We must, therefore, lay down the criteria therefore.
AIIMS in terms of an order passed by this Court has been conducting the said examination. It may
continue to do so unless a competent body is created by the Central Government in terms of a
Parliamentary Act or otherwise. All expenses for conducting such examination shall be borne by the
Central Government which would also provide the requisite infrastructure therefore. One test shall
be held for all the students taking admission throughout the country. This order is passed keeping in
view the fact that now one common entrance test is held for admission against 25% of all India
quota and other tests are being held by the respective Universities. Disparities in such tests should
be done away with and merit of the students should be judged on the basis of one test held therefore.

AIIMS is an institution of excellence. It is a class by itself and pride. We are, therefore, of the
opinion that in the AIIMS and the medical colleges of the Central University, merit should have
primacy subject of course to institutional preference to the extent of 50% of the total seats in the
MBBS Course. In all other respects the decision of this Court in All India Institute of Medical
Sciences Students' Union's case (supra) shall operate.

Our directions aforementioned, however, are interim in nature. The Parliament having regard to
Entry 66, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India has the legislative competence
which would take care of the country as a whole. While making such a legislation, the Parliament
undoubtedly would take into consideration the special needs of some small States, having regard to
their backwardness economic, social and educational as also geographical conditions.

The Parliament has also the legislative competence in terms of Entry 25, List III of the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution. It for education and particularly higher education where excellence is
required, while enacting law must also foresee that in the era of liberalisation and globalisation,
Indian citizens must compete with their counter-parts of the developed countries. Merit, thus, must
be allowed to explore to the fullest extent. Genius hidden in the citizens must be allowed to blossom.
Despite 55 years of India's existence as an independent nation, a National policy on higher
education has not come into being. Its significance and importance was highlighted in Dr. Pradeep
Jain's case (supra); but the Parliament did not pay any heed thereto.

The courts are normally reluctant to issue any direction to the Central Government for making law.
Following our practice, we refrain ourselves to issue any direction in this regard. We hope and trust
that the Central Government expeditiously consider of making legislation or taking such steps as are
necessary in this behalf keeping in view the requirement of coordination in higher education in
terms of Entry 66, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.

For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any merit in the contentions advanced on behalf of the
petitioners. The petitioners are not entitled to any relief. With the aforesaid directions, these writ

petitions and the appeal are disposed of.

There shall be no order as to costs.

 

S.B. Sinha, J.

I have had the advantage of reading the draft opinion of Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India. While
concurring with the said judgment, I would like to add a few rods of mine.

The core question involved in these appeals is as to whether by providing for institutional
reservation, the equality clause is violated.

Article 14 of the Constitution of India prohibits discrimination in any form. Discrimination at its
worst form would be violative of the basic and essential feature of the Constitution. It is trite that
even the fundamental rights of a citizen must conform to the basic feature of the Constitution.
Preamble of the Constitution in no uncertain terms lays emphasis on equality.

In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala Shelat and Grover, JJ. stated that:
"582.....(5) The dignity of the individual secured by the various freedoms and basic rights in Part III
and the mandate to build a welfare State contained in Part IV would be violative of basic feature of
the Constitution of India.’ Further, Hegde and Mukherjea, JJ stated the law thus:

"661.....The broad contours the basic elements or fundamental features of our Constitution are
clearly delineated in the preamble. Unlike in most of the other Constitution, it is comparatively easy
in the case of our Constitution to discern and determine the basic elements or the fundamental
features of our Constitution. For doing so, one has only to look to the preamble."

Kesavananda Bharati (supra) has been followed in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and Ors.

In Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim Singhji v. Union of India and Ors. Krishna Iyer, J., however, in his
characteristic style opined:

"20... The question of basic structure being breached cannot arise when we examine the vires of an
ordinary legislation as distinguished from a constitutional amendment. Kesavananda Bharati

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 23Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

cannot be the last refuge of the Proprietariat when benign legislation takes away their 'excess' for
societal weal. Nor, indeed, can every breach of equality spell disaster as a lethal violation of the basic
structure. Peripheral inequality is inevitable when large-scale equalization processes are put into
action. If all the judges of the Supreme Court in solemn session sit and deliberate for half a year to
produce a legislation for reducing glaring economic inequality their genius will let them down if the
essay is to avoid even peripheral inequalities. Every large cause claims some martyr, as sociologists
will know. Therefore, what is a betrayal of the basic feature is not a mere violation of Article 14 but a
shocking, unconscionable or unscrupulous travesty of the quintessence of equal justice. If a
legislation does go that far it shakes the democratic foundation and must suffer the death penalty."

Recently a question came up before the US Supreme Court in Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher
v. Lee Bollinger decided on 23rd June, 2003 likely to be reported in (2003) 539 U.S. wherein the
guidelines providing for selection method under which every applicant from an under represented
racial or ethnic minority groups was to be automatically awarded 20 points out of 100 points needed
to guarantee admission, was struck down as has been violative of equality protection clause. It was
observed:

"The very nature of a college's permissible practice of awarding value to racial diversity means that
race must be considered in a way that increases some applicants’ chances for admission. Since
college admission is not left entirely to inarticulate intuition, it is hard to see what is inappropriate
in association some stated value to a relevant characteristic, whether it be reasoning ability, writing
style, running speed, or minority race. Justice Powell's plus factors necessarily are assigned some
values. The college simply does by a numbered scale what the law school accomplish in its "holistic
review", Grutter, Post, at 26; the distinction does not imply that applicants to the undergraduate
college are denied individualized consideration or a fair chance to compete on the basis of all the
various merits their applications may disclose."

Delivering his minority opinion on his own behalf as also on behalf of Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, however, held:

"Our jurisprudence ranks race a "suspect" category, "not because (race) is inevitably an
impermissible classification, but because it is one which usually, to our national shame has been
drawn for the purpose of maintaining racial inequality." Norwalk Core v. Norwalk Redevelopment
Agency, 395 F. 2d 920, 931-932 (CA2 1968) (footnote omitted). But where race is considered "for
the purpose of achieving equality." id. at 932, no automatic prescription is in order. For as
insightfully explained, "the Constitution is both color blind and color conscious. To avoid conflict
with the equal protection clause, a classification that denies a benefit causes harm or imposes a
burden must not be based on race in that sense, the Constitution is color blind. But the Constitution
is color conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past
discrimination, "United States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Ed., 372 F.2d 836, 876 (CA5 1966)
(Wisdom, J.)' see Wechsler, The Nationalization of Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Supp. To 12 Tex.
Q.10, 23 (1968) (Brown may be seen as disallowing racial classifications that "imply an invidious
assessment" while allowing such classifications when "not invidious in implication" but advanced to
"correct inequalities"). Contemporary human rights documents draw just this line, they distinguish

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 24Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

between policies of oppression and measures designed to accelerate de facto equality. See Grutter,
post, at 1 (Ginsburg, J. concurring) (citing the United Nations - initiated Conventions on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women)."

The validity of institutional reservation must be judged on the touchstone of equality clause.

While considering the reasonableness of the institutional reservation, we have taken into
consideration the effect of equality clause contained in Article 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India.

The question as regard merit of the students vis-a-vis right of development and human rights angle
had been considered at some length in Islamic Academy of Education and Anr. v. State of Karnataka
and Ors. [JT 2003 (7) SC 1] and following Pradeep Jain v. Union of India it has been held:

For the purpose of achieving excellence in a professional institution, merit indisputably should be a
relevant criterion. Merit, as has been noticed in the judgment may be determined in various ways
(Para 59). There cannot be, however, any fool-proof method whereby and whereunder the merit of a
student for all times to come may be judged. Only, however, because a student may fare differently
in a different situation and at different point of time by itself cannot be a ground to adopt different
standards for judging his merit at different points of time. Merit for any purpose and in particular
for the purpose of admission in a professional college should be judged as far as possible on the
basis of same or similar examination. In other words, inter se merit amongst the students similarly
situated should be judged applying the same norm or standard. Different types of examinations,
different sets of questions, different ways of evaluating the answer books may yield different results
in the case of the same student.

Selection of students, however, by the minority institutions even for the members of their
community cannot be bereft of merit. Only in a given situation less meritorious candidates from the
minority community can be admitted vis-a-vis the general category; but therefore the modality has
to be worked out. For the said purpose de facto equality doctrine may be applied instead of de jure
equality as every kind of discrimination may not be violative of the equality clause. (See Pradeep
Jain v. Union of India ).

Even applying the said tests, institutional reservation cannot be held to be unconstitutional.

Mr. Nariman contended that provision for reservation being a suspect legislation the strict scrutiny
test should be applied. Even applying such a test, we do not think that the institutional reservation
should be done away with having regard to the present day scenario. We may notice that such a test
has been applied for upholding a statute recently in Balram Kumawat v. Union of India [(2003) 7
SCC 626].

 

Dr. AR. Lakshmanan,J.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 25Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

While concurring with the conclusion arrived at by Hon'ble the Chief Justice, I would like to add the
following few lines for streamlining the policies and processes for admission to Medical Courses and
other Professional Courses. The issues and options are discussed below:

Every year during the admission season several lakhs of students undergo immense suffering and
harassment in seeking admission to Professional Courses caused by uncertain policies, ambiguous
procedures and inadequate information.

The miseries of students and parents are escalating year after year due to boundless expansion in
the number of professional institutions and their in take capacity, emergence of a large variety of
newer disciplines and mobility of students seeking admissions beyond the boundaries of States.

The students who are about to complete their high school education go through a period of acute
anxiety caused by the uncertain situation about their chances for further education. The number of
qualified students wanting to go for higher studies has been swelling largely motivated by hopes of
better economic security and partly by a desire to attain greater upward social mobility. Then begins
their trauma due to many prevailing unfair practices in admissions and devious ways of fee
collections exploiting the anxiety of students and uncertainty of procedures. Most of the efforts to
deal with these problems are ad-hoc in nature often decided under judicial orders. Different State
and Central authorities take many different actions often leading to severe inconsistencies. There is
substantial scope for streamlining the admission process, even within the regulatory powers of the
authorities, provided these issues are not dealt with on an emergency basis during the admission
season but done in a co
ordinated and comprehensive manner ahead of time.
ISSUE NUMBER ONE:
ENTRY QUALIFICATION:

For admissions to under-graduate programmes, there are several different eligibility
norms among the different categories of institutions and among the various States.

Some are based on Twelfth Standard marks or grades only, some are based on the Entrance
Examination only, and some are determined by a combination of these with different weightages.
There is endless number of justifications for each of the above, confusing the students from different
parts of the country.

The preferred option, in my view, should be for a designated agency or the University concerned to
conduct the entrance examination for professional as well as non-professional institutions in the
specified subjects, (an option suggested by this Court). The marks awarded in those subjects should
be the basis for determining the merits of the students for admission to the institutions to which

they apply.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 26Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003
ISSUE NUMBER TWO:

UNPLANNED GROWTH OF INSTITUTIONS The growth of the Professional Institutions has been
at an geometrical rate during the last five years. During recent years the expansion of educational
facilities for higher education has been nearly exclusively in the private unaided sector due to the
financial incapacity of Governments.

Those who have ventured to start the new institutions are motivated by commercial interests and
not by educational and social interests. Political considerations have become paramount in
sanctioning of colleges. There has been a high level of exploitation of students in certain disciplines
through unethical and illegal collection of unauthorized payments. The discontent among the
meritorious students is simmering also because only those, even with poor competence, but who
could pay high illegal amounts can get into many institutions.

OPTIONS:
1. The country needs to evolve urgently a predictable pattern of growth for the Higher
Education system in Technical, Managerial, and other Professional disciplines as well
in Science and Humanities at least for the next five years. The present level of ad-hoc
approach and stampede should be eliminated.
2. The national blue print and the road map for the development of professional

education should be based on maintaining credible level of quality standards and
anticipated demand structure in economic and social sectors.

ISSUE NUMBER THREE:

FEE STRUCTURE:

This Court states: "A rational fee structure should be adopted by the Management, which would not
be entitled to charge a capitation fee. Appropriate machinery can be devised by the State or
University to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and that there is no profiteering."

OPTIONS:

One possible remedy is to make a rule under the Prevention of the Capitation Fee Act that collecting
any fee that was not previously announced in the college publications and any fee collected without
a formal receipt should be punishable offences. This rule should be strictly enforced.

ISSUE NUMBER FOUR:

CERTIFICATES HASSLES:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 27Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

When we consider the size of our country and the large number of institutions and huge volume of
applicants, the man hour and money lost in running around for getting the certificates during the
admission season must run into equivalent of several crores of rupees. A more hassle-free system for
authenticating the required information from students should be evolved.

OPTIONS:

Every student be provided with a basic identity certificate while he/she is in the higher secondary
stage (10th to 12th std). This should provide all essential information such as date of birth,
community, domicile, photo identity etc., authenticated by a designated official. This should be
acceptable for admission requirements in any institution and in any State in India.

Superspeciality Institutions and Institutions where highly skilled Training/Education is imparted:

On the issue whether there can be Article 15(4) reservations in super-speciality courses, this Court
was categorical when it declared that there could not be any reservation at the level of
super-specialisation in medicine because any dilution of merit at the level would adversely affect the
national interest in having the best possible at the highest level of professional and educational
training."

Similar view was already taken by this Court in Pradeep Jain V. Union of India, AIR 1984 SC 1420.

In similar vein, in Jagdish Saran vs. Union of India, AIR 1980 SC 820, this Court observed that
Merit must be the test when choosing the best, according to this rule of equal chance for equal
marks.

This proposition has greater importance when we reach the higher levels of education for
postgraduate courses. This Court further observed that the host of variables influence the
qualification of the reservation as one factor deserves great emphasis, the higher the level of the
speciality the lesser the role of reservation.

In the case of Article 15(4) reservations, this Court has made it clear that the claims of national
interest demands that these reservations can never exceed 50% of the available seats in the
concerned educational institutions.

The view was approved by this Court in the case of Indra Sawhney V.

Union of India. If one looks at this issue in the light of the spirit of the ratios laid down in Preeti
Srivatsava v. State of M.P., AIR 1999 SC 2894 and in AIIMS Students Union v. A.I.I.M.S., AIR 2001
SC 3262, one would come to the inevitable conclusions that the constitutional reservations
contemplated under Article 15(4) should be kept at the minimal level so that national interest in the
achievement of the goal of excellence in all fields is not unduly affected.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 28Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

Of course, as between the reserved category candidates, there should be inter-se merit observed.
This has been emphasised by this court in several cases. As regards the constitutional validity of
institutional/regional/university wise reservation/preference, in view of this court's emphasis on the
need to strive for excellence which alone is in the national interest, it may not be possible to sustain
its constitutional validity. However, the presently available decisional law is in support of
institutional preference to the extent of 50% of the total available seats in the concerned educational
institutions.

Conclusions:

1) In the case of Central educational institutions and other institutions of excellence in the country
the judicial thinking has veered around the dominant idea of national interest with its limiting effect
on the constitutional prescription of reservations. The result is that in the case of these institutions
the scope for reservations is minimal.

2) As regards the feasibility of constitutional reservations at the level of super-specialities, the
position is that the judiciary has adopted the dominant norm, i.e., "the higher the level of the
speciality the lesser the role of reservation". At the level of super-specialities the rule of "equal
chance for equal marks" dominates. This view equally applies to all super-speciality institutions.

3) As regards the scope of reservation of seats in educational institutions affiliated and recognised
by State Universities, the constitutional prescription of reservation of 50% of the available seats has
to be respected and enforced.

4 ) The institutional preference should be limited to 50% and the rest being left for open
competition based purely on merits on an All India basis.

5) As regards private non-minority educational institutions distinction between government aided
and unaided institutions. While government/State can prescribe guidelines as to the process of
selection and admission of students, the government/State while issuing guidelines has to take into
consideration the constitutional mandate of the requirement of protective discrimination in matters
of reservation of seats as ordained by the decisional law in the country. Accordingly, the extent of
reservation in no case can exceed 50% of the seats. The inter-se merit may be assessed on the basis
of acommon All India Entrance Test or on the basis of marks at the level of qualifying examination.

6) The position with respect to minority aided institutions is that they are bound by the requirement
of constitutional reservation along with other regulatory controls. However, the right to admit
students of their choice being part of the right of religious and linguistic minorities, to establish and
administer educational institutions of their choice, the managements of these educational
institutions can reserve seats to a reasonable extent, not necessarily 50% as laid down in Stephens
College case. Out of the seats left after the deduction of management quota, the State can require the
observance of the requirement of Constitutional reservation.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/309064/ 29Saurabh Chaudri & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors on 4 November, 2003

7) As regards the unaided institutions, they have large measure of autonomy even in matters of
admission of students as they are not bound by the constraints of the demands of Article 29(2). Nor
are they bound by the constraints of the obligatory requirements of Constitutional reservation.

Before parting with this case, I am of the opinion that the younger generation in our society
nurturing fond hopes and aspiration for their future professional careers should feel it as a
pleasurable experience to explore the available options in higher education. They should be spared
from the mental torture due hassles and unsavoury experiences in getting to the first base. To the
extent possible they should be made to feel that they are part of one nation. Tensions and
frustrations at their impressionable age will surely result i a society with distorted and negative
values damaging the foundations of a healthy society. The policies and procedures for admissions
should be viewed from the larger impact on the future of India.

Leave granted in SLP(C) Nos.9103-9105 of 2001

1. Public employment in a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic, has to be as set down by
the Constitution and the laws made thereunder. Our constitutional scheme envisages employment
by the Government and its instrumentalities on the basis of a procedure established in that behalf.
Equality of opportunity is the hallmark, and the Constitution has provided also for affirmative
action to ensure that unequals are not treated equals. Thus, any public employment has to be in
terms of the constitutional scheme.

2. A sovereign government, considering the economic situation in the country and the work to be got
done, is not precluded from making temporary appointments or engaging workers on daily wages.
Going by a law newly enacted, The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, the object is to
give employment to at least one member of a family for hundred days in an year, on paying wages as
fixed under that Act. But, a regular process of recruitment or appointment has to be resorted to,
when regular vacancies in posts, at a particular point of time, are to be filled up and the filling up of
those vacancies cannot be done in a haphazard manner or based on patronage or other
considerations. Regular appointment must be the rule.

3. But, sometimes this process is not adhered to and the Constitutional scheme of public
employment is by-passed. The Union, the States, their departments and instrumentalities have
resorted to irregular appointments, especially in the lower rungs of the service, without reference to
the duty to ensure a proper appointment procedure through the Public Service Commission or
otherwise as per the rules adopted and to permit these irregular appointees or those appointed on

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 1Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

contract or on daily wages, to continue year after year, thus, keeping out those who are qualified to
apply for the post concerned and depriving them of an opportunity to compete for the post. It has
also led to persons who get employed, without the following of a regular procedure or even through
the backdoor or on daily wages, approaching Courts, seeking directions to make them permanent in
their posts and to prevent regular recruitment to the concerned posts. Courts have not always kept
the legal aspects in mind and have occasionally even stayed the regular process of employment
being set in motion and in some cases, even directed that these illegal, irregular or improper
entrants be absorbed into service. A class of employment which can only be called ‘litigious
employment’, has risen like a phoenix seriously impairing the constitutional scheme. Such orders
are passed apparently in exercise of the wide powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
Whether the wide powers under Article 226 of the Constitution is intended to be used for a purpose
certain to defeat the concept of social justice and equal opportunity for all, subject to affirmative
action in the matter of public employment as recognized by our Constitution, has to be seriously
pondered over. It is time, that Courts desist from issuing orders preventing regular selection or
recruitment at the instance of such persons and from issuing directions for continuance of those
who have not secured regular appointments as per procedure established. The passing of orders for
continuance, tends to defeat the very Constitutional scheme of public employment. It has to be
emphasized that this is not the role envisaged for High Courts in the scheme of things and their wide
powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India are not intended to be used for the purpose of
perpetuating illegalities, irregularities or improprieties or for scuttling the whole scheme of public
employment. Its role as the sentinel and as the guardian of equal rights protection should not be
forgotten.

4. This Court has also on occasions issued directions which could not be said to be consistent with
the Constitutional scheme of public employment. Such directions are issued presumably on the
basis of equitable considerations or individualization of justice. The question arises, equity to
whom? Equity for the handful of people who have approached the Court with a claim, or equity for
the teeming millions of this country seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for
competing for employment? When one side of the coin is considered, the other side of the coin, has
also to be considered and the way open to any court of law or justice, is to adhere to the law as laid
down by the Constitution and not to make directions, which at times, even if do not run counter to
the Constitutional scheme, certainly tend to water down the Constitutional requirements. It is this
conflict that is reflected in these cases referred to the Constitution Bench.

5. The power of a State as an employer is more limited than that of a private employer inasmuch as
it is subjected to constitutional limitations and cannot be exercised arbitrarily (See Basu's Shorter
Constitution of India). Article 309 of the Constitution gives the Government the power to frame
rules for the purpose of laying down the conditions of service and recruitment of persons to be
appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or any of the
States. That Article contemplates the drawing up of a procedure and rules to regulate the
recruitment and regulate the service conditions of appointees appointed to public posts. It is well
acknowledged that because of this, the entire process of recruitment for services is controlled by
detailed procedure which specify the necessary qualifications, the mode of appointment etc. If rules
have been made under Article 309 of the Constitution, then the Government can make

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 2Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

appointments only in accordance with the rules. The State is meant to be a model employer. The
Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959 was enacted to ensure
equal opportunity for employment seekers. Though this Act may not oblige an employer to employ
only those persons who have been sponsored by employment exchanges, it places an obligation on
the employer to notify the vacancies that may arise in the various departments and for filling up of
those vacancies, based on a procedure. Normally, statutory rules are framed under the authority of
law governing employment. It is recognized that no government order, notification or circular can
be substituted for the statutory rules framed under the authority of law. This is because, following
any other course could be disastrous inasmuch as it will deprive the security of tenure and the right
of equality conferred on civil servants under the Constitutional scheme. It may even amount to
negating the accepted service jurisprudence. Therefore, when statutory rules are framed under
Article 309 of the Constitution which are exhaustive, the only fair means to adopt is to make
appointments based on the rules so framed.

6. These two sets of appeals reflect the cleavage of opinion in the High Court of Karnataka based on
the difference in approach in two sets of decisions of this Court leading to a reference of these
appeals to the Constitution Bench for decision. The conflict relates to the right, if any, of employees
appointed by the State or by its instrumentalities on a temporary basis or on daily wages or casually,
to approach the High Court for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing that they be made
permanent in appropriate posts, the work of which they were otherwise doing. The claim is
essentially based on the fact that they having continued in employment or engaged in the work for a
significant length of time, they are entitled to be absorbed in the posts in which they had worked in
the department concerned or the authority concerned. There are also more ambitious claims that
even if they were not working against a sanctioned post, even if they do not possess the requisite
qualification, even if they were not appointed in terms of the procedure prescribed for appointment,
and had only recently been engaged, they are entitled to continue and should be directed to be
absorbed.

7. In Civil Appeal Nos.3595-3612 of 1999 the respondents therein who were temporarily engaged on
daily wages in the Commercial Taxes Department in some of the districts of the State of Karnataka
claim that they worked in the department based on such engagement for more than 10 years and
hence they are entitled to be made permanent employees of the department, entitled to all the
benefits of regular employees. They were engaged for the first time in the years 1985-86 and in the
teeth of orders not to make such appointments issued on 3.7.1984. Though the Director of
Commercial Taxes recommended that they be absorbed, the Government did not accede to that
recommendation. These respondents thereupon approached the Administrative Tribunal in the year
1997 with their claim. The Administrative Tribunal rejected their claim finding that they have not
made out a right either to get wages equal to that of others regularly employed or for regularization.
Thus, the applications filed were dismissed. The respondents approached the High Court of
Karnataka challenging the decision of the Administrative Tribunal. It is seen that the High Court
without really coming to grips with the question falling for decision in the light of the findings of the
Administrative Tribunal and the decisions of this Court, proceeded to order that they are entitled to
wages equal to the salary and allowances that are being paid to the regular employees of their cadre
in government service with effect from the dates from which they were respectively appointed. It

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 3Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

may be noted that this gave retrospective effect to the judgment of the High Court by more than 12
years. The High Court also issued a command to the State to consider their cases for regularization
within a period of four months from the date of receipt of that order. The High Court seems to have
proceeded on the basis that, whether they were appointed before 01.07.1984, a situation covered by
the decision of this Court in Dharwad District Public Works Department vs. State of Karnataka
(1990 (1) SCR 544) and the scheme framed pursuant to the direction thereunder, or subsequently,
since they have worked for a period of 10 years, they were entitled to equal pay for equal work from
the very inception of their engagement on daily wages and were also entitled to be considered for
regularization in their posts.

8. Civil Appeal Nos.1861-2063 of 2001 reflects the other side of the coin. The appellant association
with indefinite number of members approached the High Court with a writ petition under Article
226 of the Constitution of India challenging the order of the government directing cancellation of
appointments of all casual workers/daily rated workers made after 01.07.1984 and further seeking a
direction for the regularization of all the daily wagers engaged by the government of Karnataka and
its local bodies. A learned Single Judge of the High Court disposed of the writ petition by granting
permission to the petitioners before him, to approach their employers for absorption and
regularization of their services and also for payment of their salaries on par with the regular
workers, by making appropriate representations within the time fixed therein and directing the
employers to consider the cases of the claimants for absorption and regularization in accordance
with the observations made by the Supreme Court in similar cases. The State of Karnataka filed
appeals against the decision of the learned Single Judge. A Division Bench of the High Court allowed
the appeals. It held that the daily wage employees, employed or engaged either in government
departments or other statutory bodies after 01.07.1984, were not entitled to the benefit of the
scheme framed by this Court in Dharwad District Public Works Department case, referred to earlier.
The High Court considered various orders and directions issued by the government interdicting
such engagements or employment and the manner of entry of the various employees. Feeling
aggrieved by the dismissal of their claim, the members of the associations have filed these appeals.

9. When these matters came up before a Bench of two Judges, the learned Judges referred the cases
to a Bench of three Judges. The order of reference is reported in 2003 (9) SCALE 187. This Court
noticed that in the matter of regularization of ad hoc employees, there were conflicting decisions by
three Judge Benches of this Court and by two Judge Benches and hence the question required to be
considered by a larger Bench. When the matters came up before a three Judge Bench, the Bench in
turn felt that the matter required consideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the conflict and
in the light of the arguments raised by the Additional Solicitor General. The order of reference is
reported in 2003 (10) SCALE 388. It appears to be proper to quote that order of reference at this
stage. It reads:

1. "Apart from the conflicting opinions between the three Judges’ Bench decisions in Ashwani
Kumar and Ors. Vs. State of Bihar and Ors., reported in 1997 (2) SCC 1, State of Haryana and Ors

Wage Employees Association and Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka and Ors.

under appeal of Karnataka High Court in State of Karnataka vs. H. Ganesh Rao, decided on
1.6.2000, reported in 2001 (4) Karnataka Law Journal 466, learned Additional Solicitor General
urged that the scheme for regularization is repugnant to Articles 16(4), 309, 320 and 335 of the
Constitution of India and, therefore, these cases are required to be heard by a Bench of Five learned
Judges (Constitution Bench).

2. On the other hand, Mr. M.C. Bhandare, learned senior counsel, appearing for the employees
urged that such a scheme for regularization is consistent with the provision of Articles 14 and 21 of
the Constitution.

3. Mr. V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel, appearing in CC Nos.109-498 of 2003, has filed the
G.O. dated 19.7.2002 and submitted that orders have already been implemented.

4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion between three Judges Bench decisions of this
Court, we are of the view that these cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges.

5. Let these matters be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate orders."

We are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue here. We have to lay down the law. We have to
approach the question as a constitutional court should.

10. In addition to the equality clause represented by Article 14 of the Constitution, Article 16 has
specifically provided for equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. Buttressing these
fundamental rights, Article 309 provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution, Acts of
the legislature may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public
services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State. In view of the
interpretation placed on Article 12 of the Constitution by this Court, obviously, these principles also
govern the instrumentalities that come within the purview of Article 12 of the Constitution. With a
view to make the procedure for selection fair, the Constitution by Article 315 has also created a
Public Service Commission for the Union and Public Service Commissions for the States. Article 320
deals with the functions of Public Service Commissions and mandates consultation with the
Commission on all matters relating to methods of recruitment to civil services and for civil posts and
other related matters. As a part of the affirmative action recognized by Article 16 of the Constitution,
Article 335 provides for special consideration in the matter of claims of the members of the
scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for employment. The States have made Acts, Rules or
Regulations for implementing the above constitutional guarantees and any recruitment to the
service in the State or in the Union is governed by such Acts, Rules and Regulations. The
Constitution does not envisage any employment outside this constitutional scheme and without
following the requirements set down therein.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 5Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

11. In spite of this scheme, there may be occasions when the sovereign State or its instrumentalities
will have to employ persons, in posts which are temporary, on daily wages, as additional hands or
taking them in without following the required procedure, to discharge the duties in respect of the
posts that are sanctioned and that are required to be filled in terms of the relevant procedure
established by the Constitution or for work in temporary posts or projects that are not needed
permanently. This right of the Union or of the State Government cannot but be recognized and there
is nothing in the Constitution which prohibits such engaging of persons temporarily or on daily
wages, to meet the needs of the situation. But the fact that such engagements are resorted to, cannot
be used to defeat the very scheme of public employment. Nor can a court say that the Union or the
State Governments do not have the right to engage persons in various capacities for a duration or
until the work in a particular project is completed. Once this right of the Government is recognized
and the mandate of the constitutional requirement for public employment is respected, there cannot
be much difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is ordinarily not proper for courts whether
acting under Article 226 of the Constitution or under Article 32 of the Constitution, to direct
absorption in permanent employment of those who have been engaged without following a due
process of selection as envisaged by the constitutional scheme.

12. What is sought to be pitted against this approach, is the so called equity arising out of giving of
temporary employment or engagement on daily wages and the continuance of such persons in the
engaged work for a certain length of time. Such considerations can have only a limited role to play,
when every qualified citizen has a right to apply for appointment, the adoption of the concept of rule
of law and the scheme of the Constitution for appointment to posts. It cannot also be forgotten that
it is not the role of courts to ignore, encourage or approve appointments made or engagements given
outside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders based on such sentiments or approach would
result in perpetuating illegalities and in the jettisoning of the scheme of public employment adopted
by us while adopting the Constitution. The approving of such acts also results in depriving many of
their opportunity to compete for public employment. We have, therefore, to consider the question
objectively and based on the constitutional and statutory provisions. In this context, we have also to
bear in mind the exposition of law by a Constitution Bench in State of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh &
Ors. (1964 (4) SCR 964). It was held therein, "In our opinion, where a Government servant has no
right to a post or to a particular status, though an authority under the Government acting beyond its
competence had purported to give that person a status which it was not entitled to give, he will not
in law be deemed to have been validly appointed to the post or given the particular status."

13. During the course of the arguments, various orders of courts either interim or final were brought
to our notice. The purport of those orders more or less was the issue of directions for continuation
or absorption without referring to the legal position obtaining. Learned counsel for the State of
Karnataka submitted that chaos has been created by such orders without reference to legal
principles and it is time that this Court settled the law once for all so that in case the court finds that
such orders should not be made, the courts, especially, the High Courts would be precluded from
issuing such directions or passing such orders. The submission of learned counsel for the
respondents based on the various orders passed by the High Court or by the Government pursuant
to the directions of Court also highlights the need for settling the law by this Court. The bypassing of
the constitutional scheme cannot be perpetuated by the passing of orders without dealing with and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 6Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

deciding the validity of such orders on the touchstone of constitutionality. While approaching the
questions falling for our decision, it is necessary to bear this in mind and to bring about certainty in
the matter of public employment. The argument on behalf of some of the respondents is that this
Court having once directed regularization in the Dharwad case (supra), all those appointed
temporarily at any point of time would be entitled to be regularized since otherwise it would be
discrimination between those similarly situated and in that view, all appointments made on daily
wages, temporarily or contractually, must be directed to be regularized. Acceptance of this argument
would mean that appointments made otherwise than by a regular process of selection would become
the order of the day completely jettisoning the constitutional scheme of appointment. This argument
also highlights the need for this Court to formally lay down the law on the question and ensure
certainty in dealings relating to public employment. The very divergence in approach in this Court,
the so-called equitable approach made in some, as against those decisions which have insisted on
the rules being followed, also justifies a firm decision by this Court one way or the other. It is
necessary to put an end to uncertainty and clarify the legal position emerging from the
constitutional scheme, leaving the High Courts to follow necessarily, the law thus laid down.

14. Even at the threshold, it is necessary to keep in mind the distinction between regularization and
conferment of permanence in service jurisprudence. In STATE OF MYSORE Vs. S.V.
NARAYANAPPA [1967 (1) S.C.R. 128], this Court stated that it was a mis-conception to consider
that regularization meant permanence. In R.N. NANJUNDAPPA Vs T. THIMMIAH & ANR. [(1972)
2 S.C.R. 799], this Court dealt with an argument that regularization would mean conferring the
quality of permanence on the appointment. This Court stated:- "Counsel on behalf of the respondent
contended that regularization would mean conferring the quality of permanence on the
appointment, whereas counsel on behalf of the State contended that regularization did not mean
permanence but that it was a case of regularization of the rules under Article 309. Both the
contentions are fallacious. If the appointment itself is in infraction of the rules or if it is in violation
of the provisions of the Constitution, illegality cannot be regularized.

Ratification or regularization is possible of an act which is within the power and province of the
authority, but there has been some non-compliance with procedure or manner which does not go to
the root of the appointment. Regularization cannot be said to be a mode of recruitment. To accede to
such a proposition would be to introduce a new head of appointment in defiance of rules or it may
have the effect of setting at naught the rules."

In B.N. Nagarajan & Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors. [(1979) 3 SCR 937], this court clearly held
that the words "regular" or "regularization" do not connote permanence and cannot be construed so
as to convey an idea of the nature of tenure of appointments. They are terms calculated to condone
any procedural irregularities and are meant to cure only such defects as are attributable to
methodology followed in making the appointments. This court emphasized that when rules framed
under Article 309 of the Constitution of India are in force, no regularization is permissible in
exercise of the executive powers of the Government under Article 162 of the Constitution in
contravention of the rules. These decisions and the principles recognized therein have not been
dissented to by this Court and on principle, we see no reason not to accept the proposition as
enunciated in the above decisions. We have, therefore, to keep this distinction in mind and proceed

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 7Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

on the basis that only something that is irregular for want of compliance with one of the elements in
the process of selection which does not go to the root of the process, can be regularized and that it
alone can be regularized and granting permanence of employment is a totally different concept and
cannot be equated with regularization.

15. We have already indicated the constitutional scheme of public employment in this country, and
the executive, or for that matter the Court, in appropriate cases, would have only the right to
regularize an appointment made after following the due procedure, even though a non-fundamental
element of that process or procedure has not been followed. This right of the executive and that of
the court, would not extend to the executive or the court being in a position to direct that an
appointment made in clear violation of the constitutional scheme, and the statutory rules made in
that behalf, can be treated as permanent or can be directed to be treated as permanent.

16. Without keeping the above distinction in mind and without discussion of the law on the question
or the effect of the directions on the constitutional scheme of appointment, this Court in Daily Rated
Casual Labour Vs. Union of India & Ors. (1988 (1) SCR 598) directed the Government to frame a
scheme for absorption of daily rated casual labourers continuously working in the Posts and
Telegraphs Department for more than one year. This Court seems to have been swayed by the idea
that India is a socialist republic and that implied the existence of certain important obligations
which the State had to discharge. While it might be one thing to say that the daily rated workers,
doing the identical work, had to be paid the wages that were being paid to those who are regularly
appointed and are doing the same work, it would be quite a different thing to say that a socialist
republic and its Executive, is bound to give permanence to all those who are employed as casual
labourers or temporary hands and that too without a process of selection or without following the
mandate of the Constitution and the laws made thereunder concerning public employment. The
same approach was made in Bhagwati Prasad Vs. Delhi State Mineral Development Corporation
(1989 Suppl. (2) SCR 513) where this Court directed regularization of daily rated workers in phases
and in accordance with seniority.

17. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also controlled by economic considerations and
financial implications of any public employment. The viability of the department or the
instrumentality or of the project is also of equal concern for the State. The State works out the
scheme taking into consideration the financial implications and the economic aspects. Can the court
impose on the State a financial burden of this nature by insisting on regularization or permanence in
employment, when those employed temporarily are not needed permanently or regularly? As an
example, we can envisage a direction to give permanent employment to all those who are being
temporarily or casually employed in a public sector undertaking. The burden may become so heavy
by such a direction that the undertaking itself may collapse under its own weight. It is not as if this
had not happened. So, the court ought not to impose a financial burden on the State by such
directions, as such directions may turn counter- productive.

18. The Decision in Dharwad Distt. P.W.D. Literate Daily Wage Employees Association & ors. Vs.
State of Karnataka & Ors. (1990 (1) SCR 544) dealt with a scheme framed by the State of Karnataka,

though at the instance of the court. The scheme was essentially relating to the application of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 8Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

concept of equal pay for equal work but it also provided for making permanent, or what it called
regularization, without keeping the distinction in mind, of employees who had been appointed ad
hoc, casually, temporarily or on daily wage basis. In other words, employees who had been
appointed without following the procedure established by law for such appointments. This Court, at
the threshold, stated that it should individualize justice to suit a given situation. With respect, it is
not possible to accept the statement, unqualified as it appears to be. This Court is not only the
constitutional court, it is also the highest court in the country, the final court of appeal. By virtue of
Article 141 of the Constitution of India, what this Court lays down is the law of the land. Its decisions
are binding on all the courts. Its main role is to interpret the constitutional and other statutory
provisions bearing in mind the fundamental philosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto
ourselves a system of governance by rule of law. The role of the Supreme Court is to render justice
according to law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme Court is expected to decide questions of law for
the country and not to decide individual cases without reference to such principles of law.
Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders not consistent with its own decisions on law, is bound to send
out confusing signals and usher in judicial chaos. Its role, therefore, is really to interpret the law and
decide cases coming before it, according to law. Orders which are inconsistent with the legal
conclusions arrived at by the court in the self same judgment not only create confusion but also tend
to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that equity tends to vary with the Chancellor's
foot.

19. In Dharwad case, this Court was actually dealing with the question of 'equal pay for equal work’
and had directed the State of Karnataka to frame a scheme in that behalf. In paragraph 17 of the
judgment, this Court stated that the precedents obliged the State of Karnataka to regularize the
services of the casual or daily/monthly rated employees and to make them the same payment as
regular employees were getting. Actually, this Court took note of the argument of counsel for the
State that in reality and as a matter of statecraft, implementation of such a direction was an
economic impossibility and at best only a scheme could be framed. Thus a scheme for absorption of
casual/daily rated employees appointed on or before 1.7.1984 was framed and accepted. The
economic consequences of its direction were taken note of by this Court in the following words.

"We are alive to the position that the scheme which we have finalized is not the ideal one but as we
have already stated, it is the obligation of the court to individualize justice to suit a given situation in
a set of facts that are placed before it. Under the scheme of the Constitution, the purse remains in
the hands of the executive. The legislature of the State controls the Consolidated Fund out of which
the expenditure to be incurred, in giving effect to the scheme, will have to be met. The flow into the
Consolidated Fund depends upon the policy of taxation depending perhaps on the capacity of the
payer. Therefore, unduly burdening the State for implementing the constitutional obligation
forthwith would create problems which the State may not be able to stand. We have, therefore, made
our directions with judicious restraint with the hope and trust that both parties would appreciate
and understand the situation. The instrumentality of the State must realize that it is charged with a
big trust. The money that flows into the Consolidated Fund and constitutes the resources of the
State comes from the people and the welfare expenditure that is meted out goes from the same Fund
back to the people. May be that in every situation the same tax payer is not the beneficiary. That is
an incident of taxation and a necessary concomitant of living within a welfare society."

With respect, it appears to us that the question whether the jettisoning of the constitutional scheme
of appointment can be approved, was not considered or decided. The distinction emphasized in R.N.
NANJUNDAPPA Vs T. THIMMIAH & ANR. (supra), was also not kept in mind. The Court appears
to have been dealing with a scheme for 'equal pay for equal work’ and in the process, without an
actual discussion of the question, had approved a scheme put forward by the State, prepared
obviously at the direction of the Court, to order permanent absorption of such daily rated workers.
With respect to the learned judges, the decision cannot be said to lay down any law, that all those
engaged on daily wages, casually, temporarily, or when no sanctioned post or vacancy existed and
without following the rules of selection, should be absorbed or made permanent though not at a
stretch, but gradually. If that were the ratio, with respect, we have to disagree with it.

20. We may now consider, State of Haryana Vs. Piara Singh and Others [1992) 3 SCR 826]. There,
the court was considering the sustainability of certain directions issued by the High Court in the
light of various orders passed by the State for the absorption of its ad hoc or temporary employees
and daily wagers or casual labour. This Court started by saying:

"Ordinarily speaking, the creation and abolition of a post is the prerogative of the Executive. It is the
Executive again that lays down the conditions of service subject, of course, to a law made by the
appropriate legislature. This power to prescribe the conditions of service can be exercised either by
making rules under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution or (in the absence of such rules) by
issued rules/instructions in exercise of its executive power. The court comes into the picture only to
ensure observance of fundamental rights, statutory provisions, rules and other instructions, if any
governing the conditions of service"

This Court then referred to some of the earlier decisions of this Court while stating:

"The main concern of the court in such matters is to ensure the rule of law and to see that the
Executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal to its employees consistent with the requirements of
Articles 14 and 16. It also means that the State should not exploit its employees nor should it seek to
take advantage of the helplessness and misery of either the unemployed persons or the employees,
as the case may be. As is often said, the State must be a model employer. It is for this reason, it is
held that equal pay must be given for equal work, which is indeed one of the directive principles of
the Constitution. it is for this very reason it is held that a person should not be kept in a temporary
or ad hoc status for long. Where a temporary or ad hoc appointment is continued for long the court
presumes that there is need and warrant for a regular post and accordingly directs regularization.
While all the situations in which the court may act to ensure fairness cannot be detailed here, it is
sufficient to indicate that the guiding principles are the ones stated above."

This Court then concluded in paragraphs 45 to 50:

"The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment through the prescribed agency but exigencies of
administration may sometimes call for an ad hoc or temporary appointment to be made. In such a
situation, effort should always be to replace such an ad hoc/temporary employee by a regularly

selected employee as early as possible. Such a temporary employee may also compete along with

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 10Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

others for such regular selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and good, but if he does not,
he must give way to the regularly selected candidate. The appointment of the regularly selected
candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance for the sake of such an ad hoc/temporary
employee.

Secondly, an ad hoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by another ad hoc or temporary
employee; he must be replaced only by a regularly selected employee. This is necessary to avoid
arbitrary action on the part of the appointing authority.

Thirdly, even where an ad hoc or temporary employment is necessitated on account of the
exigencies of administration, he should ordinarily be drawn from the employment exchange unless
it cannot brook delay in which case the pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no candidate is
available or is not sponsored by the employment exchange, some appropriate method consistent
with the requirements of Article 16 should be followed. In other words, there must be a notice
published in the appropriate manner calling for applications and all those who apply in response
thereto should be considered fairly.

An unqualified person ought to be appointed only when qualified persons are not available through
the above processes.

If for any reason, an ad hoc or temporary employee is continued for a fairly long spell, the
authorities must consider his case for regularization provided he is eligible and qualified according
to the rules and his service record is satisfactory and his appointment does not run counter to the
reservation policy of the State "

With respect, why should the State be allowed to depart from the normal rule and indulge in
temporary employment in permanent posts? This Court, in our view, is bound to insist on the State
making regular and proper recruitments and is bound not to encourage or shut its eyes to the
persistent transgression of the rules of regular recruitment. The direction to make permanent -- the
distinction between regularization and making permanent, was not emphasized here -- can only
encourage the State, the model employer, to flout its own rules and would confer undue benefits on
a few at the cost of many waiting to compete. With respect, the direction made in paragraph 50 of
Piara Singh (supra) are to some extent inconsistent with the conclusion in paragraph 45 therein.
With great respect, it appears to us that the last of the directions clearly runs counter to the
constitutional scheme of employment recognized in the earlier part of the decision. Really, it cannot
be said that this decision has laid down the law that all ad hoc, temporary or casual employees
engaged without following the regular recruitment procedure should be made permanent.

21. We shall now refer to the other decisions. In State of Punjab and others Vs. Surinder Kumar and
others (1991 Suppl. (3) SCR 553), a three judge bench of this Court held that High Courts had no
power, like the power available to the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,
and merely because the Supreme Court granted certain reliefs in exercise of its power under Article
142 of the Constitution of India, similar orders could not be issued by the High Courts. The bench
pointed out that a decision is available as a precedent only if it decides a question of law. The

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 11Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

temporary employees would not be entitled to rely in a Writ Petition they filed before the High Court
upon an order of the Supreme Court which directs a temporary employee to be regularized in his
service without assigning reasons and ask the High Court to pass an order of a similar nature. This
Court noticed that the jurisdiction of the High Court while dealing with a Writ Petition was
circumscribed by the limitations discussed and declared by judicial decisions and the High Court
cannot transgress the limits on the basis of the whims or subjective sense of justice varying from
judge to judge. Though the High Court is entitled to exercise its judicial discretion in deciding Writ
Petitions or Civil Revision Applications coming before it, the discretion had to be confined in
declining to entertain petitions and refusing to grant reliefs asked for by the petitioners on adequate
considerations and it did not permit the High Court to grant relief on such a consideration alone.
This Court set aside the directions given by the High Court for regularization of persons appointed
temporarily to the post of lecturers. The Court also emphasized that specific terms on which
appointments were made should be normally enforced. Of course, this decision is more on the
absence of power in the High Court to pass orders against the constitutional scheme of
appointment.

22. In Director, Institute of Management Development, U.P. Vs. Pushpa Srivastava (Smt.) (1992 (3)
SCR 712), this Court held that since the appointment was on purely contractual and ad hoc basis on
consolidated pay for a fixed period and terminable without notice, when the appointment came to
an end by efflux of time, the appointee had no right to continue in the post and to claim
regularization in service in the absence of any rule providing for regularization after the period of
service. A limited relief of directing that the appointee be permitted on sympathetic consideration to
be continued in service till the end of the concerned calendar year was issued. This Court noticed
that when the appointment was purely on ad hoc and contractual basis for a limited period, on the
expiry of the period, the right to remain in the post came to an end. This Court stated that the view
they were taking was the only view possible and set aside the judgment of the High Court which had
given relief to the appointee.

23. In Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad, U.P. Vs. Anil Kumar Mishra and Others [AIR 1994 SC 1638], a
three judge bench of this Court held that ad hoc appointees/temporary employees engaged on ad
hoc basis and paid on piece-rate basis for certain clerical work and discontinued on completion of
their task, were not entitled to reinstatement or regularization of their services even if their working
period ranged from one to two years. This decision indicates that if the engagement was made in a
particular work or in connection with particular project, on completion of that work or of that
project, those who were temporarily engaged or employed in that work or project could not claim
any right to continue in service and the High Court cannot direct that they be continued or absorbed
elsewhere.

24. In State of Himachal Pradesh Vs. Suresh Kumar Verma (1996 (1) SCR 972), a three Judge Bench
of this Court held that a person appointed on daily wage basis was not an appointee to a post
according to Rules. On his termination, on the project employing him coming to an end, the Court
could not issue a direction to re-engage him in any other work or appoint him against existing
vacancies. This Court said: "It is settled law that having made rules of recruitment to various
services under the State or to a class of posts under the State, the State is bound to follow the same

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 42Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

and to have the selection of the candidates made as per recruitment rules and appointments shall be
made accordingly. From the date of discharging the duties attached to the post the incumbent
becomes a member of the services. Appointment on daily wage basis is not an appointment to a post
according to the Rules."

Their Lordships cautioned that if directions are given to re-engage such persons in any other work
or appoint them against existing vacancies, "the judicial process would become another mode of
recruitment dehors the rules."

25. In Ashwani Kumar and others Vs. State of Bihar and others (1996 Supp. (10) SCR 120), this
Court was considering the validity of confirmation of the irregularly employed. It was stated: "So far
as the question of confirmation of these employees whose entry was illegal and void, is concerned, it
is to be noted that question of confirmation or regularization of an irregularly appointed candidate
would arise if the candidate concerned is appointed in an irregular manner or on ad hoc basis
against an available vacancy which is already sanctioned. But if the initial entry itself is
unauthorized and is not against any sanctioned vacancy, question of regularizing the incumbent on
such a non-existing vacancy would never survive for consideration and even if such purported
regularization or confirmation is given it would be an exercise in futility."

This Court further stated :

"In this connection it is pertinent to note that question of regularization in any service including any
government service may arise in two contingencies. Firstly, if on any available clear vacancies which
are of a long duration appointments are made on ad hoc basis or daily-wage basis by a competent
authority and are continued from time to time and if it is found that the incumbents concerned have
continued to be employed for a long period of time with or without any artificial breaks, and their
services are otherwise required by the institution which employs them, a time may come in the
service career of such employees who are continued on ad hoc basis for a given substantial length of
time to regularize them so that the employees concerned can give their best by being assured
security of tenure. But this would require one precondition that the initial entry of such an employee
must be made against an available sanctioned vacancy by following the rules and regulations
governing such entry. The second type of situation in which the question of regularization may arise
would be when the initial entry of the employee against an available vacancy is found to have
suffered from some flaw in the procedural exercise though the person appointing is competent to
effect such initial recruitment and has otherwise followed due procedure for such recruitment. A
need may then arise in the light of the exigency of administrative requirement for waiving such
irregularity in the initial appointment by a competent authority and the irregular initial
appointment may be regularized and security of tenure may be made available to the incumbent
concerned. But even in such a case the initial entry must not be found to be totally illegal or in
blatant disregard of all the established rules and regulations governing such recruitment."

The Court noticed that in that case all constitutional requirements were thrown to the wind while
making the appointments. It was stated, "On the contrary all efforts were made to bypass the

recruitment procedure known to law which resulted in clear violation of Articles 14 and 16(1) of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 13Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

Constitution of India, both at the initial stage as well as at the stage of confirmation of these illegal
entrants. The so called regularizations and confirmations could not be relied on as shields to cover
up initial illegal and void actions or to perpetuate the corrupt methods by which these 6000 initial
entrants were drafted in the scheme."

26. It is not necessary to notice all the decisions of this Court on this aspect. By and large what
emerges is that regular recruitment should be insisted upon, only in a contingency an ad hoc
appointment can be made in a permanent vacancy, but the same should soon be followed by a
regular recruitment and that appointments to non-available posts should not be taken note of for
regularization. The cases directing regularization have mainly proceeded on the basis that having
permitted the employee to work for some period, he should be absorbed, without really laying down
any law to that effect, after discussing the constitutional scheme for public employment.

27. In A. Umarani Vs. Registrar, Cooperative Societies and Others (2004 (7) SCC 112), a three judge
bench made a survey of the authorities and held that when appointments were made in
contravention of mandatory provisions of the Act and statutory rules framed thereunder and by
ignoring essential qualifications, the appointments would be illegal and cannot be regularized by the
State. The State could not invoke its power under Article 162 of the Constitution to regularize such
appointments. This Court also held that regularization is not and cannot be a mode of recruitment
by any State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India or any body or authority
governed by a statutory Act or the Rules framed thereunder. Regularization furthermore cannot give
permanence to an employee whose services are ad hoc in nature. It was also held that the fact that
some persons had been working for a long time would not mean that they had acquired a right for
regularization.

28. Incidentally, the Bench also referred to the nature of the orders to be passed in exercise of this
Court's jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution. This Court stated that jurisdiction under
Article 142 of the Constitution could not be exercised on misplaced sympathy. This Court quoted
with approval the observations of Farewell, L.J. in Latham vs. Richard Johnson & Nephew Ltd.
(1913 (4) KB 398)"

"We must be very careful not to allow our sympathy with the infant plaintiff to affect our judgment.
Sentiment is a dangerous will o' the wisp to take as a guide in the search for legal principles."

This Court also quoted with approval the observations of this Court in Teri Oat Estates (P) Ltd. Vs.
U.T., Chandigarh (2004 (2) SCC 130) to the effect:

"We have no doubt in our mind that sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing
an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right. It is further trite
that despite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in Article 142 of the Constitution
of India, this Court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a
statutory provision."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 14Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

This decision kept in mind the distinction between 'regularization' and ‘permanency’ and laid down
that regularization is not and cannot be the mode of recruitment by any State. It also held that
regularization cannot give permanence to an employee whose services are ad hoc in nature.

29. It is not necessary to multiply authorities on this aspect. It is only necessary to refer to one or
two of the recent decisions in this context. In State of U.P. vs. Niraj Awasthi and others (2006 (1)
SCC 667) this Court after referring to a number of prior decisions held that there was no power in
the State under Art. 162 of the Constitution of India to make appointments and even if there was any
such power, no appointment could be made in contravention of statutory rules. This Court also held
that past alleged regularisation or appointment does not connote entitlement to further
regularization or appointment. It was further held that the High Court has no jurisdiction to frame a
scheme by itself or direct the framing of a scheme for regularization. This view was reiterated in
State of Karnataka vs. KGSD Canteen Employees Welfare Association (JT 2006 (1) SC 84).

30. In Union Public Service Commission Vs. Girish Jayanti Lal Vaghela & Others [2006 (2) SCALE
115], this Court answered the question, who was a Government servant and stated:
"Article 16 which finds place in Part III of the Constitution relating to fundamental rights provides
that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or
appointment to any office under the State. The main object of Article 16 is to create a constitutional
right to equality of opportunity and employment in public offices. The words "employment" or
"appointment" cover not merely the initial appointment but also other attributes of service like
promotion and age of superannuation etc. The appointment to any post under the State can only be
made after a proper advertisement has been made inviting applications from eligible candidates and
holding of selection by a body of experts or a specially constituted committee whose members are
fair and impartial through a written examination or interview or some other rational criteria for
judging the inter se merit of candidates who have applied in response to the advertisement made. A
regular appointment to a post under the State or Union cannot be made without issuing
advertisement in the prescribed manner which may in some cases include inviting applications from
the employment exchange where eligible candidates get their names registered. Any regular
appointment made on a post under the State or Union without issuing advertisement inviting
applications from eligible candidates and without holding a proper selection where all eligible
candidates get a fair chance to compete would violate the guarantee enshrined under Article 16 of
the Constitution (See B.S. Minhas Vs. Indian Statistical Institute and others AIR 1984 SC 363)."

31. There have been decisions which have taken the cue from the Dharwad (supra) case and given
directions for regularization, absorption or making permanent, employees engaged or appointed
without following the due process or the rules for appointment. The philosophy behind this
approach is seen set out in the recent decision in The Workmen of Bhurkunda Colliery of M/s
Central Coalfields Ltd. Vs. The Management of Bhurkunda Colliery of M/s Central Coalfields Ltd.
(JT 2006 (2) SC 1), though the legality or validity of such an approach has not been independently
examined. But on a survey of authorities, the predominant view is seen to be that such
appointments did not confer any right on the appointees and that the Court cannot direct their
absorption or regularization or re-engagement or making them permanent.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 15Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

32. At this stage, it is relevant to notice two aspects. In Kesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala
(1973 Supp. S.C.R. 1), this Court held that Article 14, and Article 16, which was described as a facet
of Article 14, is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India. The position emerging from
Kesavananada Bharati (supra) was summed up by Jagannatha Rao, J., speaking for a Bench of three
Judges in Indira Sawhney Vs. Union of India (1999 Suppl. (5) S.C.R. 229). That decision also
reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the Legislature could transgress the basic feature of the
Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14 of which Article 16 (1) is a
facet. This Court stated, " The preamble to the Constitution of India emphasises the principle of
equality as basic to our constitution. In Keshavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, it was ruled that
even constitutional amendments which offended the basic structure of the Constitution would be
ultra vires the basic structure. Sikri, CJ. laid stress on the basic features enumerated in the preamble
to the Constitution and said that there were other basic features too which could be gathered from
the Constitutional scheme (para 506 A of SCC). Equality was one of the basic features referred to in
the Preamble to our Constitution. Shelat and Grover, JJ. also referred to the basic rights referred to
in the Preamble. They specifically referred to equality (paras 520 and 535A of SCC). Hegde & Shelat,
JJ. also referred to the Preamble (paras 648,

652). Ray, J. (as he then was) also did so (para 886).

Jaganmohan Reddy, J. too referred to the Preamble and the equality doctrine (para 1159). Khanna,
J. accepted this position (para 1471). Mathew, J. referred to equality as a basic feature(para 1621).
Dwivedi, J. (paras 1882, 1883) and Chandrachud, J.(as he then was) (see para 2086) accepted this
position.

What we mean to say is that Parliament and the legislatures in this Country cannot transgress the
basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14 of which
Article 16(1) is a facet."

33. In the earlier decision in Indra Sawhney Vs. Union of India [1992 Supp. (2) S.C.R. 454), B.P.
Jeevan Reddy, J. speaking for the majority, while acknowledging that equality and equal
opportunity is a basic feature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant position of Articles 14
and 16 of the Constitution of India in the scheme of things. His Lordship stated:
"6. The significance attached by the founding fathers to the right to equality is evident not only from
the fact that they employed both the expressions ‘equality before the law' and ‘equal protection of
the laws' in Article 14 but proceeded further to state the same rule in positive and affirmative terms
in Articles 15 to 18 LTT TTA T TATA TATA TTT ATT TTT TTT TTT

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7. Inasmuch as public employment always gave a certain status and power --- it has always been the
repository of State power ---besides the means of livelihood, special care was taken to declare
equality of opportunity in the matter of public employment by Article 16. Clause (1), expressly
declares that in the matter of public employment or appointment to any office under the state,
citizens of this country shall have equal opportunity while clause (2) declares that no citizen shall be
discriminated in the said matter on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 16Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

birth, residence or any of them. At the same time, care was taken to, declare in clause (4) that
nothing in the said Article shall prevent the state from making any provision for reservation of
appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizen which in the opinion of the state, is
not adequately represented in the services under the state 11111."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(See paragraphs 6 and 7 at pages 544 and 545) These binding decisions are clear imperatives that
adherence to Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution is a must in the process of public employment.

34. While answering an objection to the locus standi of the Writ Petitioners in challenging the
repeated issue of an ordinance by the Governor of Bihar, the exalted position of rule of law in the
scheme of things was emphasized, Chief Justice Bhagwati, speaking on behalf of the Constitution
Bench in Dr. D.C. Wadhwa & Ors. Vs. State of Bihar & Ors. (1987 (1) S.C.R. 798) stated:

"The rule of law constitutes the core of our Constitution of India and it is the essence of the rule of
law that the exercise of the power by the State whether it be the Legislature or the Executive or any
other authority should be within the constitutional limitations and if any practice is adopted by the
Executive which is in flagrant and systematic violation of its constitutional limitations, petitioner
No. 1 as a member of the public would have sufficient interest to challenge such practice by filing a
writ petition and it would be the constitutional duty of this Court to entertain the writ petition and
adjudicate upon the validity of such practice."

Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a basic feature of our
Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of our Constitution, a Court would certainly be
disabled from passing an order upholding a violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of
the need to comply with the requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of the Constitution.
Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public employment, this Court while laying down the law,
has necessarily to hold that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a
proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any right on the appointee.
If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it
were an engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end
when it is discontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be made permanent on
the expiry of his term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely because a temporary
employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he
would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely on the strength
of such continuance, if the original appointment was not made by following a due process of
selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment
at the instance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to an end or of ad
hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, do not acquire any right. High Courts
acting under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, should not ordinarily issue directions for
absorption, regularization, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made
regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely because, an employee had continued
under cover of an order of Court, which we have described as ‘litigious employment’ in the earlier
part of the judgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the
service. In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing interim directions,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 17Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

since, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it is found entitled to relief, it may be possible
for it to mould the relief in such a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to him,
whereas an interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the regular procedure for
selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an employee who is really not required. The
courts must be careful in ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement
of its affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments to facilitate the
bypassing of the constitutional and statutory mandates.

35. The concept of ‘equal pay for equal work’ is different from the concept of conferring permanency
on those who have been appointed on ad hoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no process of
selection as envisaged by the Rules. This Court has in various decisions applied the principle of
equal pay for equal work and has laid down the parameters for the application of that principle. The
decisions are rested on the concept of equality enshrined in our Constitution in the light of the
directive principles in that behalf. But the acceptance of that principle cannot lead to a position
where the court could direct that appointments made without following the due procedure
established by law, be deemed permanent or issue directions to treat them as permanent. Doing so,
would be negation of the principle of equality of opportunity. The power to make an order as is
necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before this Court, would not
normally be used for giving the go-by to the procedure established by law in the matter of public
employment. Take the situation arising in the cases before us from the State of Karnataka. Therein,
after the Dharwad decision, the Government had issued repeated directions and mandatory orders
that no temporary or ad hoc employment or engagement be given. Some of the authorities and
departments had ignored those directions or defied those directions and had continued to give
employment, specifically interdicted by the orders issued by the executive. Some of the appointing
officers have even been punished for their defiance. It would not be just or proper to pass an order
in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 or 32 of the Constitution or in exercise of power under
Article 142 of the Constitution of India permitting those persons engaged, to be absorbed or to be
made permanent, based on their appointments or engagements. Complete justice would be justice
according to law and though it would be open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court would not
grant a relief which would amount to perpetuating an illegality.

36. While directing that appointments, temporary or casual, be regularized or made permanent,
courts are swayed by the fact that the concerned person has worked for some time and in some cases
for a considerable length of time. It is not as if the person who accepts an engagement either
temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his employment. He accepts the
employment with eyes open. It may be true that he is not in a position to bargain -- not at arms
length -- since he might have been searching for some employment so as to eke out his livelihood
and accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the
constitutional scheme of appointment and to take the view that a person who has temporarily or
casually got employed should be directed to be continued permanently. By doing so, it will be
creating another mode of public appointment which is not permissible. If the court were to void a
contractual employment of this nature on the ground that the parties were not having equal
bargaining power, that too would not enable the court to grant any relief to that employee. A total
embargo on such casual or temporary employment is not possible, given the exigencies of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 18Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

administration and if imposed, would only mean that some people who at least get employment
temporarily, contractually or casually, would not be getting even that employment when securing of
such employment brings at least some succor to them. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast
country are in search of employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or temporary
employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in that context that one has
to proceed on the basis that the employment was accepted fully knowing the nature of it and the
consequences flowing from it. In other words, even while accepting the employment, the person
concerned knows the nature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the real sense
of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in which he is temporarily employed or the
interest in that post cannot be considered to be of such a magnitude as to enable the giving up of the
procedure established, for making regular appointments to available posts in the services of the
State. The argument that since one has been working for some time in the post, it will not be just to
discontinue him, even though he was aware of the nature of the employment when he first took it
up, is not one that would enable the jettisoning of the procedure established by law for public
employment and would have to fail when tested on the touchstone of constitutionality and equality
of opportunity enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

37. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the respondents argued that on the basis of the doctrine of
legitimate expectation, the employees, especially of the Commercial Taxes Department, should be
directed to be regularized since the decisions in Dharwad (supra), Piara Singh (supra), Jacob, and
Gujarat Agricultural University and the like, have given rise to an expectation in them that their
services would also be regularized. The doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the
Administrative Authority affect the person by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which
either (i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can
legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there have been communicated to him
some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to comment;
or

(ii) he has received assurance from the decision-maker that they will not be withdrawn without
giving him first an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should not be
withdrawn {See Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions V. Minister for the Civil Service
(1985 Appeal Cases 374), National Buildings Construction Corpn. Vs. S. Raghunathan, (1998 (7)
SCC 66) and Dr. Chanchal Goyal Vs. State of Rajasthan (2003 (3) SCC 485). There is no case that
any assurance was given by the Government or the concerned department while making the
appointment on daily wages that the status conferred on him will not be withdrawn until some
rational reason comes into existence for withdrawing it. The very engagement was against the
constitutional scheme. Though, the Commissioner of the Commercial Taxes Department sought to
get the appointments made permanent, there is no case that at the time of appointment any promise
was held out. No such promise could also have been held out in view of the circulars and directives
issued by the Government after the Dharwad decision. Though, there is a case that the State had
made regularizations in the past of similarly situated employees, the fact remains that such
regularizations were done only pursuant to judicial directions, either of the Administrative Tribunal
or of the High Court and in some case by this Court. Moreover, the invocation of the doctrine of
legitimate expectation cannot enable the employees to claim that they must be made permanent or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 19Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

they must be regularized in the service though they had not been selected in terms of the rules for
appointment. The fact that in certain cases the court had directed regularization of the employees
involved in those cases cannot be made use of to found a claim based on legitimate expectation. The
argument if accepted would also run counter to the constitutional mandate. The argument in that
behalf has therefore to be rejected.

38. When a person enters a temporary employment or gets engagement as a contractual or casual
worker and the engagement is not based on a proper selection as recognized by the relevant rules or
procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the appointment being temporary, casual or
contractual in nature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being
confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could be made only by following a proper
procedure for selection and in concerned cases, in consultation with the Public Service Commission.
Therefore, the theory of legitimate expectation cannot be successfully advanced by temporary,
contractual or casual employees. It cannot also be held that the State has held out any promise while
engaging these persons either to continue them where they are or to make them permanent. The
State cannot constitutionally make such a promise. It is also obvious that the theory cannot be
invoked to seek a positive relief of being made permanent in the post.

39. It was then contended that the rights of the employees thus appointed, under Articles 14 and 16
of the Constitution, are violated. It is stated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by
employing them on less than minimum wages and extracting work from them for a pretty long
period in comparison with those directly recruited who are getting more wages or salaries for doing
similar work. The employees before us were engaged on daily wages in the concerned department on
a wage that was made known to them. There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not being
paid. Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by themselves, they cannot claim that
they are discriminated as against those who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the
relevant rules. No right can be founded on an employment on daily wages to claim that such
employee should be treated on a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and made permanent in
employment, even assuming that the principle could be invoked for claiming equal wages for equal
work. There is no fundamental right in those who have been employed on daily wages or
temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. As has
been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a regular appointment
could be made only by making appointments consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16
of the Constitution. The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily
wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who were regularly employed.
That would be treating unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed
in service even though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment rules. The
arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are therefore overruled.

40. It is contended that the State action in not regularizing the employees was not fair within the
framework of the rule of law. The rule of law compels the State to make appointments as envisaged
by the Constitution and in the manner we have indicated earlier. In most of these cases, no doubt,
the employees had worked for some length of time but this has also been brought about by the
pendency of proceedings in Tribunals and courts initiated at the instance of the employees.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 20Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

Moreover, accepting an argument of this nature would mean that the State would be permitted to
perpetuate an illegality in the matter of public employment and that would be a negation of the
constitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of India. It is therefore not possible to accept the
argument that there must be a direction to make permanent all the persons employed on daily
wages. When the court is approached for relief by way of a writ, the court has necessarily to ask itself
whether the person before it had any legal right to be enforced. Considered in the light of the very
clear constitutional scheme, it cannot be said that the employees have been able to establish a legal
right to be made permanent even though they have never been appointed in terms of the relevant
rules or in adherence of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.

41. It is argued that in a country like India where there is so much poverty and unemployment and
there is no equality of bargaining power, the action of the State in not making the employees
permanent, would be violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. But the very argument indicates that
there are so many waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for competing for employment
and it is in that context that the Constitution as one of its basic features, has included Articles 14, 16
and 309 so as to ensure that public employment is given only in a fair and equitable manner by
giving all those who are qualified, an opportunity to seek employment. In the guise of upholding
rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, a set of persons cannot be preferred over a vast
majority of people waiting for an opportunity to compete for State employment. The acceptance of
the argument on behalf of the respondents would really negate the rights of the others conferred by
Article 21 of the Constitution, assuming that we are in a position to hold that the right to
employment is also a right coming within the purview of Article 21 of the Constitution. The
argument that Article 23 of the Constitution is breached because the employment on daily wages
amounts to forced labour, cannot be accepted. After all, the employees accepted the employment at
their own volition and with eyes open as to the nature of their employment. The Governments also
revised the minimum wages payable from time to time in the light of all relevant circumstances. It
also appears to us that importing of these theories to defeat the basic requirement of public
employment would defeat the constitutional scheme and the constitutional goal of equality.

42. The argument that the right to life protected by Article 21 of the Constitution of India would
include the right to employment cannot also be accepted at this juncture. The law is dynamic and
our Constitution is a living document. May be at some future point of time, the right to employment
can also be brought in under the concept of right to life or even included as a fundamental right. The
new statute is perhaps a beginning. As things now stand, the acceptance of such a plea at the
instance of the employees before us would lead to the consequence of depriving a large number of
other aspirants of an opportunity to compete for the post or employment. Their right to
employment, if it is a part of right to life, would stand denuded by the preferring of those who have
got in casually or those who have come through the back door. The obligation cast on the State
under Article 39(a) of the Constitution of India is to ensure that all citizens equally have the right to
adequate means of livelihood. It will be more consistent with that policy if the courts recognize that
an appointment to a post in government service or in the service of its instrumentalities, can only be
by way of a proper selection in the manner recognized by the relevant legislation in the context of
the relevant provisions of the Constitution. In the name of individualizing justice, it is also not
possible to shut our eyes to the constitutional scheme and the right of the numerous as against the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 21Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

few who are before the court. The Directive Principles of State Policy have also to be reconciled with
the rights available to the citizen under Part III of the Constitution and the obligation of the State to
one and all and not to a particular group of citizens. We, therefore, overrule the argument based on
Article 21 of the Constitution.

43. Normally, what is sought for by such temporary employees when they approach the court, is the
issue of a writ of mandamus directing the employer, the State or its instrumentalities, to absorb
them in permanent service or to allow them to continue. In this context, the question arises whether
a mandamus could be issued in favour of such persons. At this juncture, it will be proper to refer to
the decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Dr. Rai Shivendra Bahadur Vs. The
Governing Body of the Nalanda College [(1962) Supp. 2 SCR 144]. That case arose out of a refusal to
promote the writ petitioner therein as the Principal of a college. This Court held that in order that a
mandamus may issue to compel the authorities to do something, it must be shown that the statute
imposes a legal duty on the authority and the aggrieved party had a legal right under the statute or
tule to enforce it. This classical position continues and a mandamus could not be issued in favour of
the employees directing the government to make them permanent since the employees cannot show
that they have an enforceable legal right to be permanently absorbed or that the State has a legal
duty to make them permanent.

44. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where irregular appointments (not illegal
appointments) as explained in S.V. NARAYANAPPA (supra), R.N. NANJUNDAPPA (supra), and
B.N. NAGARAJAN (supra), and referred to in paragraph 15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly
sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and the employees have continued to work for ten
years or more but without the intervention of orders of courts or of tribunals. The question of
regularization of the services of such employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of
the principles settled by this Court in the cases above referred to and in the light of this judgment. In
that context, the Union of India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take
steps to regularize as a one time measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have
worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of courts or of
tribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant
sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers
are being now employed. The process must be set in motion within six months from this date. We
also clarify that regularization, if any already made, but not subjudice, need not be reopened based
on this judgment, but there should be no further by-passing of the constitutional requirement and
regularizing or making permanent, those not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme.

45. It is also clarified that those decisions which run counter to the principle settled in this decision,
or in which directions running counter to what we have held herein, will stand denuded of their
status as precedents.

46. In cases relating to service in the commercial taxes department, the High Court has directed that
those engaged on daily wages, be paid wages equal to the salary and allowances that are being paid
to the regular employees of their cadre in government service, with effect from the dates from which
they were respectively appointed. The objection taken was to the direction for payment from the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179794777/ 22Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006

dates of engagement. We find that the High Court had clearly gone wrong in directing that these
employees be paid salary equal to the salary and allowances that are being paid to the regular
employees of their cadre in government service, with effect from the dates from which they were
respectively engaged or appointed. It was not open to the High Court to impose such an obligation
on the State when the very question before the High Court in the case was whether these employees
were entitled to have equal pay for equal work so called and were entitled to any other benefit. They
had also been engaged in the teeth of directions not to do so. We are, therefore, of the view that, at
best, the Division Bench of the High Court should have directed that wages equal to the salary that
are being paid to regular employees be paid to these daily wage employees with effect from the date
of its judgment. Hence, that part of the direction of the Division Bench is modified and it is directed
that these daily wage earners be paid wages equal to the salary at the lowest grade of employees of
their cadre in the Commercial Taxes Department in government service, from the date of the
judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court. Since, they are only daily wage earners, there
would be no question of other allowances being paid to them. In view of our conclusion, that Courts
are not expected to issue directions for making such persons permanent in service, we set aside that
part of the direction of the High Court directing the Government to consider their cases for
regularization. We also notice that the High Court has not adverted to the aspect as to whether it
was regularization or it was giving permanency that was being directed by the High Court. In such a
situation, the direction in that regard will stand deleted and the appeals filed by the State would
stand allowed to that extent. If sanctioned posts are vacant (they are said to be vacant) the State will
take immediate steps for filling those posts by a regular process of selection. But when regular
recruitment is undertaken, the respondents in C.A. No. 3595-3612 and those in the Commercial
Taxes Department similarly situated, will be allowed to compete, waiving the age restriction
imposed for the recruitment and giving some weightage for their having been engaged for work in
the Department for a significant period of time. That would be the extent of the exercise of power by
this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution to do justice to them.

47. Coming to Civil Appeal Nos. 1861-2063 of 2001, in view of our conclusion on the questions
referred to, no relief can be granted, that too to an indeterminate number of members of the
association. These appointments or engagements were also made in the teeth of directions of the
Government not to make such appointments and it is impermissible to recognize such appointments
made in the teeth of directions issued by the Government in that regard. We have also held that they
are not legally entitled to any such relief. Granting of the relief claimed would mean paying a
premium for defiance and insubordination by those concerned who engaged these persons against
the interdict in that behalf. Thus, on the whole, the appellants in these appeals are found to be not
entitled to any relief. These appeals have, therefore, to be dismissed.

48. C.A. Nos. 3520-24 of 2002 have also to be allowed since the decision of the Zilla Parishads to
make permanent the employees cannot be accepted as legal. Nor can the employees be directed to
be treated as employees of the Government, in the circumstances. The direction of the High Court is
found unsustainable.

49. In the result, Civil Appeal Nos. 3595-3612 of 1999, Civil Appeal No. 3849 of 2001, Civil Appeal
Nos. 3520-3524 of 2002 and Civil appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos.

HEADNOTE:
In respect of some private dispute between two neighbors a
writ application was filed in the High Court. On the

material produced in the case it was treated as a Public
Interest Litigation and the High Court was to rind out a
solution in respect (if unauthorised constructions alleged
to have been made by different owners/occupiers/builders
without sanctioned plans or by making deviations from the
sanctioned plans. The High Court wanted to ensure that such
unauthorised constructions were not perpetuated on the basis

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

of interim orders of injunction passed by the Civil Courts-.
The High Court disposed of the petition holding that the
owners/ occupiers/builders were to be given liberty to file
fresh building plans and that the Municipal Corporation was
to examine such building plans in accordance with law and
that the Corporation was to seal and to demolish those
constructions which were beyond the compoundable limits.
The High Court also directed that no civil suit would be
entertained by any Court in Delhi in respect of any action
taken or proposed to be taken by the Corporation with regard
to the sealing and/or demolition of any building or any part
thereof. The High Court directed further that person
aggrieved by an order of sealing or demolition had the right
to file an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal under the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.

522

523

Against the High Court's order the present appeals were
filed by special leave.

On the question, "whether the jurisdiction of the Court has
been statutorily barred in respect of suits in connection
with the orders passed or proceedings initiated for
demolition of constructions, which have been made without
sanction or by deviating from the sanctioned’ plans",
allowing the appeals, this Court,

HELD:1.1. With the increase in the number of taxing
statutes, welfare legislations and enactments to protect a
class of citizens,a trend can be noticed that most of such
legislations confer decision making powers on various
authorities and they seek to Limit or exclude Court's power
to review those decisions. The result is that the power of
the Court under section 9 of the Code is being denuded and
curtailed by such special enactments, in respect of
liabilities created or rights conferred. The ouster of the
jurisdiction of the Court is upheld on the finding that the
rights or liabilities in question had been created by the
Act in question and remedy provided therein Was adequate.
(535-D-F)

1.2.The situation will be different where a statute purports
to curb and curtail a pre-existing common law right and
purports to oust the jurisdiction of the Court so far remedy
against the orders passed under such statute are concerned.
In such cases,the courts have to be more vigilant, while
examining the question as to whether an adequate redressal
Machinery has been provided, before which the person
aggrieved may agitate his grievance. (535-G)

1.3.In spite of the bar placed on the power of the Court,
orders passed under such statutes can be examined on
"jurisdictional question". A suit will be-maintainable.

1.4. The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act purports’ to

regulate the common law right of the citizens to erector

construct buildings of their choice. This right existed

since time immemorial. But with the urbanisation and
development of the concept of planned city, regulations,
restrictions, on such common law right have been imposed.

But as the provisions of the Act intend to regulate and

restrict a common law right, and not any right or liability

created under the Act itself, it cannot be said that the

right and the remedy have been given unoflatu e.g. "in the
same breath". (537-E)

1.5. In spite of the bar prescribed under sub-sections (4)
and (5) of section 343 and section 347E of the Corporation
Act over the power of the Courts, under certain special
circumstances,the Court can examine, whether the dispute
falls within the ambit of the Act. But once the Court is
satisfied that either the provisions of the Act are not
applicable to the building in question or the _ basic
procedural requirements which are vital in nature, have not
been followed, it shall have jurisdiction, to enquire and
investigate while protecting the common law rights of the
citizens. (537-C)

1.6. The regulations and bye-laws in respect of buildings,
are meant to

525

serve the public interest. But at the same time it cannot
be held that in all circumstances, the authorities entrusted

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

with the demolition of unauthorised constructions, have
exclusive power, to the absolute exclusion of the power of
the Court. In some special cases where "jurisdictional
error" on the part of the Corporation is established, a suit
shall be maintainable. (538-C)

1.7. The Court should not ordinarily entertain a suit in
connection with the proceedings initiated for demolition by
the Commissioner, in terms of section 343 (1) (of the
Corporation Act. The Court should direct the persons
aggrieved to pursue the remedy before the Appellate Tribunal
and then before the Administrator in accordance with the
provisions of the said Act. (538-D)

1.8. The Court should entertain a suit questioning the
validity of an order passed under section 343 of the Act,
only if the Court is of prima facie opinion that the order
is nullity in the eyes of law because of any "jurisdictional
error" in exercise of the power by the Commissioner or that
the order is outside the Act. (538-E)

2.1. A party is not entitled to an order of injunction as a
matter of right or course. Grant of injunction is within
the discretion of the Court and such discretion is to he
exercised in favour of the plaintiff only if it is proved to
the satisfaction of the Court that unless the defendant is
restrained by an order of injunction, an irreparable loss or
damage will be caused to the plaintiff during the pendency
of the suit. (538-H)

2.2.The purpose of temporary injunction is, to maintain the
status quo. The Court grants such relief according to the
legal principles- ex debite justitiae. Before any such
order is passed the Court must be satisfied that a _ strong
prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff
including on the question of maintainability of the suit and
the balance of convenience is in his favour and refusal of
injunction would cause irreparable injury to him. (539B)
2.3. 'The Court should be always willing to extend its hand
to protect a citizen who is being wronged or is being
deprived of a property without any authority in law (or
without following the procedure which are fundamental and
vital in nature. But at the same time the judicial
proceedings cannot be used to protect or to perpetuate a
wrong committed by a person who approaches the Court. (5391))

526

2.4. Power to grant injunction is an extra-ordinary power
vested in the Court to he exercised taking into
consideration the facts and circumstances of a particular
case. The Courts have to be more cautious when the said
power is being exercised without notice or hearing the party
who is to he affected by the order so passed. (539-E)

2.5. In spite of the statutory requirement, in order 39,
Rule 3 the Courts have been passing orders of injunction
before issuance of notices or hearing the parties against
whom such orders are to operate without recording the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

reasons for passing such orders. It is said that if the
reasons for grant of injunction are mentioned, a grievance
can be made by the other side that Court has prejudged the
issues involved in the suit. This is a misconception about
the nature and the scope of interim orders. Any opinion
expressed in connection with an interlocutory application
has no bearing and shall not affect any party,, at the stage
of the final adjudication. Apart from that now in view of
the proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39, there is no scope for any
argument. When the statute itself requires reasons to he
recorded, the Court cannot ignore that requirement by saying
that if reasons are recorded, it may amount to expressing an
opinion in favour of the plaintiff before hearing the
defendant (539-H, 540-H)

2.6. Proviso to Rule 3 of Order39 of the Code, attracts the
principle, that if a statute requires a thing to he done in
a particular manner, it should be done in that manner or not
all.

Taylor v. Taylor, (1875)1 Ch. D. 426; Nazir Ahmed v.
Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253 and Ramachandra Keshar Adke v.
Gavind Joti Chavare, AIR 1975 SC

915, relied on.

2.7. Whenever a Court considers it necessary in the
facts and circumstances of a particular case to pass an
order of injunction without notice to other side, it must
record the reasons for doing so and should take into
consideration, while passing an order of injunction, all
relevant factors, including as to how the object of granting
injunction itself shall be defeated if an exparty order is
not passed. But any such exparty order should be in force
up to a particular date before which the plaintiff should be

JUDGMENT:

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 2531-33 of 1993.

From the Judgment and Order dated 19.2.1991 of the Delhi High Court in C.W.P. No. 3499 of 1989.
R.M. Bagai, V. Shekhar, Ms. Bina Gupta and Ms. Monika Mohil for the Appellants.

Kapil Sibal, Ranjit Kumar and R.P. Sharma for the Respondents.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by N.P. SINGH. J. Special leave granted.

These appeals have been filed against an order passed by the Delhi High Court directing the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi (hereinafter referred to as "the Corporation") to issue appropriate
notices to the owners/occupiers/builders of the building where illegal constructions have been
made. A liberty has been given to the owners/occupiers/builders to file fresh buildings plans with
the Corporation in conformity with the existing bye- laws. The building plans as filed are to be
examined in accordance with the law. The Corporation has been directed that if it finds that the
constructions are beyond the compoundable limits, then to seal the same and to demolish
thereafter.

The appellants have no grievance so far as the aforesaid part of the order is concerned. They have
sought interference of this Court with the other part of the order, where it has been said that "no
civil suit will be entertained by any court in Delhi in respect of any action taken or proposed to be
taken by the Corporation with regard to the sealing and/or demolition of any building or any part
thereof. Any person aggrieved by an order of sealing or demolition which is passed shall, however,
have the right of filing an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal under the Municipal Act. The Appellate
Tribunal is the only forum which has the jurisdiction to grant interim relief." The other part of the
order in respect of which objection has been taken is where the Court has directed the Corporation
to approach those courts which have already issued injunction "for variation and vacation of the
injunction orders in the light of" the said order.

Initially a writ application was filed in respect of some private dispute between two neighbours. In
due course on the material produced by one party or the other it was treated as a Public Interest

Litigation and by the impugned order the High Court has purported to find out a solution in respect

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 6Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

of unauthorised constructions alleged to have been made by different owners/ occupiers/builders in
the different parts of the city without sanctioned plans or by making deviations from the plans
which had been sanctioned. The Court has also purported to ensure that such unauthorised
constructions are not perpetuated on the basis of interim orders of injunction passed by Civil
Courts. It cannot be disputed that by the impugned order the jurisdiction of any Court in Delhi to
entertain any suit in connection with demolition of any part of any building which, according to the
Corporation, is unauthorised and illegal has been ousted.

The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as "the Corporation Act") has
made provisions for the constitution of the Corporation and has prescribed the procedure for
election of the councillors, levy of taxes, sanitation and public health. Chapter XVI contains
provisions regarding erection of buildings within the Corporation area. Section 331 defines the
expression "to erect a building". Section 332 says that" no person shall erect or commence to erect
any building or execute any of the works specified in section 334 except with the previous sanction
of the Commissioner". The relevant part of section 343 is as follows:
"343. Order of demolition and stoppage of buildings and works in certain cases and appeal
sesesseeeeeseeseeeesesseeseeeeesees (2)Any person aggrieved by an order of the Commissioner made under
sub-section (1) may prefer an appeal against the order to the Appellate Tribunal within the period
specified in the order for the demolition of the erection or work to which it relates.

(3)Where an appeal is preferred under sub-section(2)against an order of demolition, the Appellate
Tribunal may, subject of the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 347 C, stay the enforcement of
that order on such terms, if any, and for such period, as it may think fit:

Provided that where the erection of any building or execution of any work has not been completed at
the time of the making of the order of demolition, no order staying the enforcement of the order of
demolition shall be made by the Appellate Tribunal unless security, sufficient in the opinion of the
said Tribunal has been given by the appellant for not proceeding with such erection or work pending
the disposal of the appeal.

(4)No Court shall entertain any suit, application or order proceeding for injunction or other relief
against the Commissioner to restrain him from taking any action or making any order in pursuance
of the provisions of this section.

(5)Subject to an order made by the Administrator on appeal under section 347 D, every order made
by the Appellate Tribunal on appeal under this section, and subject to the orders of the
Administrator and the Appellate Tribunal on appeal. the order of demolition nude by the
Commissioner shall be final and conclusive".

Section 344 vests power in the Commissioner to stop the construction of the building where the
erection of such building or execution of any work has been commenced or is being carried on either
without sanction or contrary to sanction so granted or in contravention of any condition subject to
which sanction has been accorded. Under section 345A, the Commissioner at any time, before or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 7Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

after making an order of demolition under section 343 or of the stoppage of the erection of any
building or execution of any work under section 343, can make an order directing the sealing of such
erection or work or of the premises in which such erection or work is being carried or has been
completed. A further appeal has been. provided under section 347D to the Administrator against the
order of the Appellate Tribunal. Section 347E says:- "347E. Bar of jurisdiction of courts.

(1) After the commencement of section 7 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act,
1984, no court shall entertain any suit, application or other proceedings in respect of any order or
notice appealable under section 343 or section 347B and no such order or notice shall be called in
question otherwise then by preferring an appeal under these sections.

(2)Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), every suit, application or other
proceeding pending in any court immediately before the commencement of section (7) of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1984, in respect of any order or notice appealable under
section 343 or section 347B, shall continue to be dealt with and disposed of by that court as if the
said section had not been brought into force."

Because of sub-sections (4) and (5) of section 343 and section 347E aforesaid the stand of the
Corporation is that the Courts have been debarred from entertaining suits, applications or
proceedings for injunction, against any order or notice for demolition and the order of demolition
passed by the Commissioner, subject to appeals before the Appellate Tribunal and Administrator
shall be deemed to be final and conclusive.

In spite of several pronouncements of this Court during the last four decades, the question as to
whether the jurisdiction of the Court has been statutorily barred in respect of suits in connection
with the orders passed or proceedings initiated for demolition of constructions, which have been
made without sanction or by deviating from the sanctioned plans, has to be answered.

Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, (hereinafter referred to as "the Code") says that Courts
shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of civil nature "except suits of which their cognizance is either
express lyor impliedly barred".According to the Corporation once the jurisdiction of the Court to try
a suit in which the validity of any order passed under the provisions of the Corporation Act or the
notice issued thereunder has been specifically barred and an internal remedy has been provided for
redressal of the grievances of the persons concerned, there is no scope for Court to entertain a suit.

In the olden days the source of most of the rights and liabilities could be traced to the common law.
Then statutory enactments were few. Even such enactments only created rights or liabilities but
seldom provided forums for remedies. The result was that any person having a grievance that he had
been wronged or his fight was being affected, could approach the ordinary Civil Court on the
principle of law that where there is a right there is a remedy-ubi jus ibi remedium. As no internal
remedy had been provided in the different statutes creating rights or liabilities, the ordinary Civil
Courts had to examine the grievances in the light of different statutes. With the concept of the
Welfare State, it was realised that enactments creating liabilities in respect of payment of taxes
obligations after vesting of estates and conferring rights on a class of citizens, should be complete

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 8Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

codes by themselves. With that object in view, forums were created under the Acts themselves where
grievances could be entertained on behalf of the persons aggrieved. Provisions were also made for
appeals and revision to higher authorities. Then a question arose as to where a particular Act had
created a right or liability and had also provided a forum for enforcement of such right or for
protection from enforcement of a liability without any authority in law, whether a citizen could
approach a Court. It may be pointed out that many statutes have created certain rights or liabilities
and have also provided the remedial measures in respect thereof. But such statutes have not touched
the common law rights of the citizen. But there are some statutes, which in public interest affect
even the common law rights or liabilities of toe citizen, which were in the nature of existing rights.
The distinction between the two types of rights or liabilities is subtle in nature but at the same time
very vital.

In one of the earliest case of Volverhampton New Waterworks Co. v.

Hawkesford, (1859) 6 C.B. (N.S.) 336, Willes, J, said:- "There are three classes of cases in which a
liability may be established founded upon a statute. One is, where there was a liability existing at
common law, and that liability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar form of
remedy different from the remedy which existed at common law: there, unless the statute contains
words which expressly or by necessary implication exclude the common-law remedy, and the party
suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy. The second class of cases is,
where the statute gives the right to sue merely, but provides no particular form of remedy: there, the
party can only proceed by action at common law. But there is a third class, viz. where a liability not
existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular
remedy for enforcing it. The present case falls within this latter class, if any liability at all exists. The
remedy provided by the statute must be followed, and it is not competent to the party to pursue the
course applicable to cases of the second class." The same view was reiterated by the House of Lords
in Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper Limited, (1919) Appeal Cases 368. In Barraclough v.
Brown, (1897) AC 615, it was said:
"I do not think the appellant can claim to recover by virtue of the statute, and at the same time insist
upon doing so by means other than those prescribed by the statute which alone confers the right."

It was further pointed out "The right and the remedy are given uno flatu, and the one cannot be
dissociated from the other."

In the well-known case of Secretary of State v. Mask & Co., AIR 1940 Privy Council 105, this
question was considered in connection with Sea Customs Act (1878). It was said:- "It is settled law
that the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is not to be readily inferred, but that such
exclusion must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied. It is also well settled that even if
jurisdiction is so excluded, the Civil Courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the
provisions of the Act have not been complied with, or the statutory tribunal has not acted in
conformity with the fundamental principle of judicial procedure."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 9Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

But having enunciated the general principle in respect of ouster of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court
it was said:- "But, in their Lordships' opinion, neither Sec, 32 nor the principle involved in the
decision in 401 A 48, affect the validity of an Act of the Indian Legislature which creates an
obligation and provides an exclusive Code for its determination such an obligation is not covered by
sub s. (2) of Section 32."

In connection with the imposition of Terminal Tax on salt under the Punjab Municipal Act. In Firm
Seth Radha Kishan v. Administrator, Municipal committee. Ludhiana, AIR 1963 SC 1547, it was said
that where a statute created a liability and provided a remedy, party aggrieved should pursue the
remedy provided under the Act. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Firm of Illuri Subbaya Chetty
and Sons v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1964 SC 322, considered the provisions of Madras
General Sales Tax Act and the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. It was pointed out that
there was an express and unambiguous prohibition and no suit could be entertained by a Civil
Court. In connection with the Bombay Sales Tax Act the same view was reiterated by a Constitution
Bench of this Court in M/s. Kamala Mills Ltd. v. State of Bombay AIR 1965 SC 1942. In Ram Swarup
and ors. v. Shikar chand, AIR 1966 SC 893, a Constitution Bench examined the bar on the
jurisdiction of the Civil Court in connection with the House and TenantsU.P. (Temporary) control of
Rent and Eviction Act, and came to the conclusion that a special statute had excluded the
jurisdiction in clear and unambiguous words and it had provided an adequate and satisfactory
alternative remedy to a party. That may be aggrieved by the relevant order and as such the
jurisdiction of the Civil Court had been ousted. This very question was examined in State of Kerala v.
MIs N. Ramaswami Iyer and sons, AIR 1966 SC 1738, in connection with the Travancore-Cochin
General Sales Tax Act and it was held that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court would be deemed to
have been excluded because the legislature had set up a special tribunal to determine the question
relating to rights or liabilities. which had been created by the statute. Again in connection with the
provisions of the Evacuee Property Act, in Ram Gopal Redd), v. Additional Custodian Evacuee
Property Hyderabad, [1966] 3 SCR 214 and Custodian of Evacuee Property Punjab & Ors. v. Jafran
Begum, [1967] 3 SCR 736, it was held that complete machinery for adjudication of all claims had
been provided under the Act and there being a bar on the jurisdiction of any court, the Act
over-rides other laws, including Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure and there was no scope for
the Civil Court to entertain any suit.

The Constitution Bench in Dhuilabhai v. State of Madya Pradesh, AIR 1969 SC 78, said:
"Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the court, an examination of the scheme of the
particular Act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is
not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court.

Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the
particular Act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be
decisive. In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and
provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all questions about
the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted and whether remedies
normally associated with actions in civil courts are prescribed by the said statute or not."

In connection with the Industrial Disputes Act, in The Premier Automobiles Ltd. v. Kamlakar
Shantaram Wadke. AIR 1975 SC 2238 = [1976] 1 SCC 496, it was pointed out that "the Civil Court
will have no jurisdiction to try and adjudicate upon an industrial dispute, if it concerned
enforcement of certain right or liability created only under the Act. " The jurisdiction of the Civil
Court in connection with the levy of octroi duty under the C.P. and Barar Municipalities Act, 1922
was examined by this Court in Bata Shoe Co. Ltd. v. Jabalpur Corporation, AIR 1977 SC 955 19771 2
SCC 472, and held it was barred.

Whether the Court can hear and determine suits relating to levy of professional tax under the
Punjab Municipal Act, 1971 was examined in the case of Munshi Ram v. Municipal Committee.
Chheharta, AIR 1979 SC 1250 = [1979] 3 SCC 83, and it was held:
Where a Revenue Statute provides for a person aggrieved by an assessment thereunder, a particular
remedy to be sought in a particular forum, in a particular way, it must be sought in that forum and
in that manner, and all other forums and modes of seeking it are excludes." It was pointed out in
Ram Singh v. Gram Panchayat, MehalKalan, AIR 1986 SC 2197 = [1986] 4 SCC 364, that when by a
special statute rights have been created and jurisdiction of the Court has been barred then the
jurisdiction of the Court to try such suits has been taken away. In the case of Raja Ram Kumar
Bhargava v. Union of India, AIR 1988 SC 752 = [1988] 1 SCC 68 1, it was said:
"\.. Wherever a right, not preexisting in common-law is created by a statute and that statute itself
provided a machinery for the enforcement of the right, both the right and the remedy having been
created uno flatu and a finality is intended to the result of the statutory proceedings, then, even in
the absence of an exclusionary provision the civil courts'jurisdiction is impliedly barred." The
jurisdiction of Civil Court to entertain a suit for ejectment was examined in Sushil Kumar Mehta v.
GobindRam Bohra, [1990] 1 SCC 193, and it was held that the Rent Control Act was a complete Code
and the jurisdiction to try a case for ejectment was exclusive under that Act. With the increase in the
number of taxing statutes, welfare legislations and enactments to protect a class of citizens, a trend
can be noticed that most of such legislations confer decision making powers on various authorities
and they seeks to limit or exclude Court's power to review those decisions. The result is that the
power of the Court under section 9 of the Code is being denuded and curtailed by such special
enactments, in respect of liabilities created or rights conferred. This Court in the judgments referred
to above has upheld the ouster of the jurisdiction of the Court on examination of two questions (1)
Whether the right or liability in respect whereof grievance has been made, had been created under
an enactment and it did not relate to a pre-existing common law right? (2) Whether the machinery
provided for redressal of the grievance in respect of infringement of such right or imposition of a
liability under such enactment, was adequate and complete? The ouster of the jurisdiction of the
Court was upheld on the finding that the rights or liabilities in question had been created by the Act
in question and remedy provided therein was adequate.

But the situation will be different where a statute purports to curb and curtail a pre-existing
common law right and purports to oust the jurisdiction of the Court so far remedy against the orders
passed under such statute are concerned. In such cases, the courts have to be more vigilant, while
examining the question as to whether an adequate redressal machinery has been provided, before

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 11Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

which the, person aggrieved may agitate his grievance. In the case of katikara Chintamani Dora v.
Guatreddi Annamanaidu, AIR 1974 SC 1069, this Court after referring to the case of Desika
Charyulu v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1964 SC 807, observed:
"It was pertinently added that this exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court would be subject to
two limitations. First, the Civil Courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions
of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the
fundamental principles of judicial procedure. The second is as regards the exact extent to which the
powers of statutory tribunals are exclusive. The question as to whether any particular case falls
under the first or the second of the above categories would depend on the purpose of the statute and
its general scheme, taken in conjunction with the scope of the enquiry entrusted to the tribunal set
up and other relevant factors." It was held that a suit for declaration that "the decision of the
Settlement Officer/Tribunal holding certain properties to be an ‘estate’ under section 3(2) (d) of the
1908 Act was void, was maintainable on the ground that the suit property was not an'inam village’.
In Pyx Granite Co. Ltd. v. Ministry of Housing and Local Government, [1960] A.C. 260, the
appellants sought a declaration of their common law right to quarry their land without the need to
obtain planning permission under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. In that connection it
was said:
"The appellant company are given no new right of quarrying by the Act of 1947. Their
right is a common law right and the only question is how far it has been taken away.
They do not uno flatu claim under the Act and seek a remedy elsewhere. On the
contrary, they deny that they come within its purview and seek a declaration to that
effect."

In spite of the bar placed on the power of the Court. orders passed under such statutes can be
examined on "jurisdictional question". To illustrate-, a special machinery has been provided for
removal of the encroachments from public land' under different enactments in different states and
the jurisdiction of the Court has been barred in respect of the orders passed by such special tribunals
or authorities constituted under such Acts. Still a suit will be maintainable before a Court on a plea
that the land in question shall not be deemed to be public land within the meaning of the definition
of public land given in the Act in question, and as such provisions thereof shall not be applicable.

In the case of Anisminic Lid. v. Foreign Compensation Commission, (1969) 2 AC 147, a wide
interpretation has been given to the word ‘jurisdiction’ by the House of Lords. It was pointed out
that in many cases where although the Tribunal has jurisdiction to enter upon an enquiry, it has
done or failed to do something in the course of such enquiry which is of such a nature that its
decision becomes a nullity. By mere reference to different provisions of the Corporation Act it shall
appear that the Act does not create any right or liability. Chapter XVI of the Act only purports to
regulate the erection of the buildings within the Corporation area, so that erections of the buildings
within the Corporation area are systematic, planned and do not adopt the character of mushroom
growth. In view of the Provisions of the Act, whenever it is discovered that erection of any building
or execution of any work has been commenced or is being carried or has been completed, either
without sanction or contrary to the sanction or in contravention of any condition subject to which

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 42Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

such sanction had been accorded, the Commissioner can make an order directing that such erection
or work shall be demolished. Any person aggrieved by an order has been given a right to prefer an
appeal before the Appellate Tribunai and thereafter to the Administrator. Subject to any order
passed by the Appellate Tribunal and the Administrator, the order for demolition shall be deemed to
be final and conclusive.

According to us, it cannot be urged that the provisions of the Act have created any right or liability
and for enforcement thereof remedy has been provided under the Act itself. The Act purports to
regulate the common law right of the citizens to erect or construct buildings of their choice. This
right existed since time immorial. But with the urbanisation and development of the concept of
planned city, regulations, restrictions, on such common law right have been imposed. But as the
provisions of the Act intend to regulate and restrict a common law right, and not any right liability
created under the Act itself, it cannot be said that the right and the remedy have become given uno
flatu e.g. "in the same breath". Most of the cases of this Court referred to above related to statutes
creating rights or liabilities and providing remedies at the same time. As such the principles
enunciated therein, shall not be fully applicable in the present case. In spite of the bar prescribed
under sub-sections (4) and (5) of section 343 and section 347E of the Corporation Act over the
power of the Courts, under certain special circumstances, the Court can examine, whether the
dispute falls within the ambit of the Act. But once the Court is satisfied that either the provisions of
the Act are not applicable to the building in question or the basic procedural requirements which are
vital in nature, have not been followed, it shall have jurisdiction, to enquire and investigate while
protecting the common law rights of the citizens. Can a Court hold a suit to be not maintainable,
although along with the plaint materials are produced to show that the building in question is not
within the Corporation limits, or that the constructions were made prior to coming into force of the
relevant provisions of the Act? We are conscious of the fact that persons who make unauthorised
constructions by contravening and violating the building bye-laws or regulations often run to
Courts, with pleas mentioned above, specially that no notice was issued or served on them, before
the Corporation has ordered the demolition of the construction.

It is well-known that in most of the cities building regulations and bye-laws have been framed, still it
has been discovered that constructions have been made without any sanction or in contravention of
the sanctioned plan, and such constructions have continued without any intervention. There cannot
be two opinions that the regulations and bye- laws in respect of buildings, are meant to serve the
public interest. But at the same time it cannot be held that in all circumstances, the authorities
entrusted with the demolition of unauthorised constructions, have exclusive power, to the absolute
exclusion of the power of the Court. In some special cases where "jurisdictional error" on the part of
the Corporation is established, a suit shall be maintainable. According to us, (1)The Court should not
ordinarily entertain a suit in connection with the proceedings initiated for demolition, by the
Commissioner, in terms of section 343 (1) of the Corporation Act. The Court should direct the
persons aggrieved to pursue the remedy before the Appellate Tribunal and then before the
Administrator in accordance with the provisions of the said Act.

(2)The Court should entertain a suit questioning the validity of an order passed under section 343 of
the Act. only if the Court is of Prima facie opinion that the order is nullity in the eyes of law because

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 13Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

of any "jurisdictional error" in exercise of the power by the commissioner or that the order is outside
the Act.

TEMPORARY INJUNCTION It need not be said that primary object of filing a suit challenging the
validity of the order of demolition is to restrain such demolition with the intervention of the Court.
In such a suit the plaintiff is more interested in getting an order of interim injunction. It has been
pointed out repeatedly that a party is not entitled to an order of injunction as a matter of right or
course., Grant of injunction is within the discretion of the Court and such discretion is to be
exercised in favour of the plaintiff only if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that unless the
defendant is restrained by an order of injunction, an irreparable loss or damage will be caused to the
plaintiff during the pendency of the suit. The purpose of temporary injunction is, thus, to maintain
the status quo. The Court grants such relief according to the legal principles--ex debite justitiae.
Before any such order is passed the Court must be satisfied that a strong primafacie case has been
made out by the plaintiff including on the question of maintainability of the suit and the balance of
convenience is in his favour and refusal of injunction would cause irreparable injury to him. Under
the changed circumstance with so many cases pending in Courts, once an interim order of
injunction is passed, in many cases, such interim orders continue for months; if not for years. At
final hearing while vacating such interim orders of injunction in many cases, it has been discovered
that while protecting the plaintiffs from suffering the alleged injury, more serious injury has been
caused to the defendants due to continuance of interim orders of injunction without final hearing. It
is a matter of common knowledge that on many occasions even public interest also suffers in view of
such interim orders of injunction, because persons in whose favour such orders are passed are
interested in perpetuating the contraventions made by them by delaying the final disposal of such
applications. The court should be always willing to extent its hand to protect a citizen who is being
wronged or is being deprived of a property without any authority in law or without following the
procedure which are fundamental and vital in nature. But at the same time the judicial proceedings
cannot-be. used to protect or to perpetuate a wrong committed by a person who approaches the
Court.

Power to grant injunction is an extraordinary power vested in the Court to be exercised taking into
consideration the facts and circumstances of a particular case. The Courts have to be more cautious
when the said power is being exercised without notice or hearing the party who is to be affected by
the order so passed. That is why Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code requires that in ail cases the Court
shall, before grant of an injunction, direct notice of the application to be given to the opposite party,
except where it appears that object of granting injunction itself would be defeated by delay. By the
Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1976, a proviso has been added to the said rule saying that
"where it is proposed to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite
party, the Court shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction
would be defeated by delay......

It has come to our notice that in spite of the aforesaid statutory requirement, the Courts have been
passing orders of injunction before issuance of notices or hearing the parties against whom such
orders are to operate without recording the reasons for passing such orders. It is said that if the
reasons for grant of injunction are mentioned, a grievance can be made by the other side that Court

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 14Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

has prejudged the issues involved in the suit. According to us, this is a misconception about the
nature and the scope of interim orders. It need not be pointed out that any opinion expressed in
connection with an interlocutory application has no bearing and shall not affect any party, at the
stage of the final adjudication. Apart from that now in view of the proviso to Rule 3 aforesaid, there
is no scope for any argument. When the statute itself requires reasons to be recorded, the Court
cannot ignore that requirement by saying that if reasons are recorded, it may amount to expressing
an opinion in favour of the plaintiff before hearing the defendant. The imperative nature of the
proviso has to be judged in the context of Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code. Before the Proviso
aforesaid was introduced, Rule 3 said "the Court shall in all cases, except where it appears that the
object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an injunction,
direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party". The proviso was
introduced to provide a condition, where Court proposes to grant an injunction without giving
notice of the application to the opposite party, being of the opinion that the object of granting
injunction itself shall be defeated by delay. The condition so introduced is that the Court "shall
record the reasons" why an ex parte order of injunction was being passed in the facts and
circumstances of a particular case. In this background, the requirement for recording the reasons for
grant of ex parte injunction, cannot be held to be a mere formality. This requirement is consistent
with the principle, that a party to a suit, who is being restrained from exercising a right which such
party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law, must be informed why
instead of following the requirement of Rule 3, the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been
followed. The party who invokes the jurisdiction of the Court for grant of an order of restraint
against a party, without affording an opportunity to him of being heard, must satisfy the Court about
the gravity of the situation and Court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parts order. We
are quite conscious of the fact that there are other statutes which contain similar provisions
requiring the Court or the authority concerned to record reasons before exercising power vested in
them. In respect of some of such provisions it has been held that they are required to be complied
with but non-compliance there of will not vitiate the order so passed. But same cannot be said in
respect of the proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39. The Parliament has prescribed a particular procedure
for passing of an order of injunction without notice to the other side, under exceptional
circumstances. Such ex parte orders have far reaching effect, as such a conditions has been imposed
that Court must record reasons before passing such order. If it is held that the compliance of the
proviso aforesaid is optional and not obligatory, then the introduction of the proviso by the
Parliament shall be a futile exercise and that part of Rule 3 will be a surplusage for all practical
purpose. Proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code, attracts the principle, that if a statute requires a
thing to be done in a particular manner, it should be done in that manner or not all. This principle
was approved and accepted in well-known cases of Taylor v. Taylor. (1875) 1 Ch. D. 426, Nazir
Ahmed v. Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253. This Court has also expressed the same view in respect of
procedural requirement of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act in the case of
Ramachandra Keshav Adke v. Govind Joti Chavare, AIR 1975 SC 915. As such whenever a Court
considers it necessary in the facts and circumstances of a particular case to pass an order of
injunction without notice to other side. It must record the reasons for doing so and should take into
consideration, while passing an order of injunction, all relevant factors, including as to how the
object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated if an ex parte order is not passed. But any such
ex parte order should be in force upto a particular date before which the plaintiff should be required

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/863497/ 15Shiv Kumar Chadha Etc. Etc vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi ... on 4 May, 1993

to serve the notice on the defendant concerned. In the Supreme Court Practice 1993, Vol. 1, at page
514, reference has been made to the views of the English Courts saying:- "Exparte injunctions are for
cases of real urgency where there has been a true impossibility of giving notice of motion....

An ex parte injunction should generally be until a certain day, usually the next motion day. ..."

Accordingly we direct that the application for interim injunction should be considered and disposed
of in the following manner:
(i)The Court should first direct the plaintiff to serve a copy of the application with a copy of the
plaint along with relevant documents on the counsel for the Corporation or any competent authority
of the Corporation and the order should be passed only after hearing the parties.

(ii)If the circumstances of a case so warrant and where the Court is of the opinion, that the object of
granting the injunction would be defeated by delay, the Court should record reasons for its opinion
as required by proviso to Rule 3 of order 39 of the Code, before passing an order for injunction. The
Court must direct that such order shall operate only for a period of two weeks, during which notice
along with copy of the application, plaint and relevant documents should be served on the
competent authority or the counsel for the Corporation. Affidavit of service of notice should be filed
as provided by proviso to Rule 3 of order 39 aforesaid If the Corporation has entered appearance,
any such exparte order of injunction should be extended only after hearing the counsel for the
Corporation.

(iii)While passing an ex parte order of injunction the Court shall direct the plaintiff to give an
undertaking that he will not make any further construction upon the premises till the application for

injunction is finally heard and disposed of.

In the result, the appeals are allowed to the extent indicated above. In the circumstances of these
cases, there shall be no order as to costs.

VPR. Appeals allowed.

HEADNOTE:

Clause (f) of sub-s. (2) of the Essential Commodities
Act, 1955 empowers the Central Government to require any
person dealing in any essential commodity to sell the whole
or specified part of such commodity to it or the State
Government or to a nominee of such Government. Sub-section
(3) provides for payment to such a seller (a) the price
agreed upon consistently with the controlled price, if any,
fixed under the section; (b) the price calculated with
reference to the controlled price, if any; and (c) where
none of these applies, a price calculated at
910
the market rate prevailing in the locality at the date of
the sale. Subsection (3-A) deals with orders made with a
view to controlling the rise in prices or preventing the
hoarding of any foodstuff in any locality and determination
of price for payment to the seller, notwithstanding anything
contained in sub-s.(3). Sub-section (3-C) lays down that
where any producer is required by an order made with reference to cl. (f) of sub-s. (2) to sell any kind of sugar and
either no notification in respect of such sugar has been
issued under sub-s. (3-A) or any such notification having
been issued has ceased to remain in force by efflux of time,
then notwithstanding anything contained in sub-s. (3), there
shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore which
shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as
the Central Government may, by order, determine having
regard to (a) the minimum price, if any, fixed for sugarcane
by Central Government under this section; (b) the manufacturing cost of sugar; (c) the duty or tax, if any, paid or
payable thereon; and (d) the securing of a reasonable return
on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing
sugar, and different prices may be determined from time to
time for different areas or for different factories or for
different kinds of sugar.

The Central Government by notifications dated 28th
November, 1974 and 11th July, 1975 issued in exercise of the
power under sub-s. (3-C) of s. 3 of the Act fixed the prices
of levy sugar for 1974-75 production.

The petitioners, owners of sugar mills operating in the
State of Uttar Pradesh in areas classified for the purpose
of determining the price of levy sugar as West and East
zones, challenged the validity of the said orders on the
grounds that they were ultra vires the Act and violative of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

their fundamental rights as the prices of levy sugar had
been determined arbitrarily with reference to the average
cost profiles of factories grouped together in zones without
regard to their individual capacity and cost characteristics; that although the Government has the discretion to fix
different prices for different areas or for different factories, or for different kinds of sugar, such wide discretion
has to be reasonably exercised, that the words ‘having
regard to' occurring in sub-s. (3-C) is a mandatory requirement demanding strict compliance with clauses (a) to (d);
that the ingredients of the said clauses should, therefore,
have been examined with reference to each producer as a
condition precedent to the determination of the price of
sugar; that the Central Government had not applied its mind
to the relevant questions to which they were expected to
have regard to in terms of thesub-section; and that the
expression ‘determine’ used in sub-section (3-C) indicates
911

that the order to which that expression referred to is
quasi-judicial amenable to judicial review. For the interveners it was contended that the cost incurred by units
having lower crushing capacity should be neutralised by
giving them an incremental levy price.

For the respondents it was contended that the division
of the country into zones and the method adopted by the
Government in fixing price of levy sugar was fully supported
by the recommendations of various expert bodies and the
Tariff Commission and was upheld in Anakapalle Co-op. Agricultural & Industrial Society Ltd. Etc. v. Union of India &
Ors., [1973] 2 SCR 882 and the Panipat Co-op. Sugar Mills".
The Union of India, [1973] 2 SCR 860; that the cost of
manufacturing sugar depends not only on recovery from the
sugarcane, duration of crushing season, crushing capacity of
the plant, the sugarcane price paid and the capital employed, but also to a considerable extent on the conditions
of the plant and machinery, quality of management, investment policy, relations with cane growers and labour, financial reputation etc.; that to group together factories
having a high cost profile and to determine a price specially applicable to them is to put a premium on incompetence,
if not mismanagement; and that the orders determining the
price of sugar in terms of sub-section (3-C) were of general
application and, therefore, legislative in character and the
omission, if any, to consider the peculiar problems of
individual producers was not a ground of judicial review.
Dismissing the writ petitions, the Court

HELD: 1. The notifications dated 28th November, 1974 and
11th July, 1975 issued under sub-s. (3-C) of s. 3 of the
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 are intra rites the Act.
There is no merit in the challenge. [950F, 918F-G]

2.1 Sub-section (3-C) is attracted whenever any producer
is required to sell sugar by an order made with reference to
sub-s. (2)(f) and no notification has been issued under

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

sub-s. (3-A) or any such notification, having been issued,
has ceased to be in force. It operates notwithstanding
anything contained in sub-s. (3). This means the compensation payable to the seller in the circumstances attracting
sub-s. (3-C) is not the price postulated in sub-s. (3). Nor
is it the price mentioned under sub-s. (3-A), for that subsection cannot be in operation when sub-s. (3-C) is attracted. What is payable under sub-s. (3-C) is an amount calculated with reference to the price of sugar. [930F-H]

The Panipat Cooperative Sugar Mills v. The Union of
India, [1973] 2 SCR 860, referred to.

2.2 The price of sugar is determined by the Central
Government having regard to the factors mentioned in cls.
(a) to (d) of sub-s. (3-C). This is done with reference to
the industry as a whole by a process of costing in respect
of a representative cross-section of manufacturing units and
not with reference to any individual seller. The order
notifying the price is required by sub-ss. (5) and (6), to
be notified in official gazette and laid before both Houses
of Parliament. [931H, 932A, 936G, 931G]

3. The words ‘having regard to' in sub-s. (3-C) are the
legislative instruction for the general guidance of the
Government in determining the price of sugar. They are not
strictly mandatory, but in essence directory. They do not
mean that the Government cannot, after taking into account
the matters mentioned in cls. (a) to (d), consider any other
matter which may be relevant. The expression is not “having
regard only to" but “having regard to". These words are not
a fetter, they are not words of limitation. [936D, 934E]

4.1 In considering the reasonableness of the order made
by the Government' in exercise of its power under sub-s.
(3-C) the Court will not strictly scrutinise the extent to
which matters mentioned in cls. (a) to (d), or any other
matters have been taken into account by the Government in
making its estimate of the price. There is sufficient compliance with the sub-section if the Government has addressed
its mind to the factors which it may reasonably consider to
be relevant, and has come to a conclusion, which any reasonable person placed in the position of the Government, would
have come to. [936E-F]

4.2 In the instant case, the material brought to the
notice of the Court does not support the arguments at the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/

of IncomeShri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

bar that the Central Government had not applied its mind to
the relevant questions to which

913

they were expected to have regard in terms of the statute.
Nor any data has been furnished to show that the prices
determined by the Government would have been different had
the ingredients of cls. (a) to (d) of the sub-section been
examined with reference to each individual producer instead
of a representative cross section of manufacturing units.

5.1 Judicial decisions are made according to law while
administrative decisions emanate from administrative policy.
Quasi-judicial decisions are also administrative decisions
emanating from adjudication but they are subject to some
measure of judicial procedure, such as rules of natural
justice. Legislative orders can be distinguished from rest
of orders by reference to the principle that the former are
of general application. They are made formally by publication and for general guidance with reference to which individual decisions are taken in particular situations, [937C,
939E, 938A-B]

H.W.R. Wade.' Administrative Law, 6th ed., 47, referred to.

5.2 An instruction may be treated as legislative even
when it is not issued formally but by circular or a_ letter
or the like. What matters is the substance and not the form,
or the name. Where an authority to whom power is delegated
is entitled to sub-delegate his power, be it legislative,
executive or judicial, then such authority may also give
instructions to his delegates and these instructions may be
regarded as legislative. However, a judicial tribunal cannot
delegate its functions except when it is authorised to do so
expressly or by necessary implication. [938B-C, D-E]

Board & Ors., [1953] 2 Q.B. 18 at 40, referred to.

5.3 What distinguishes legislation from adjudication is
that the former affects the rights of individuals in the
abstract and must be applied in a further proceeding before
the legal position of any particular individual will be
definitely touched by it; while adjudication operates concretely upon individuals in their individual capacity.

5.4 A statutory instrument such as a rule, order or
regulation emanates from the exercise of delegated legislative power which is a
914
part of the administrative process resembling enactment of
law by the legislature. It affects the rights of individuals
in the abstract. [939D-E, C]

5.5 When the function is treated as legislative, a party
affected by the order has no right to notice and bearing
unless, of course, the statute so requires. It is nevertheless imperative that the action of the authority should be
inspired by reason. It being of general application engulfing a wide sweep of powers, applicable to all persons and
situations of a broadly identifiable class, the legislative
order may not be vulnerable to challenge merely by reasons
of its omission to take into account individual peculiarities and differences amongst those failing within the class.

5.6 The orders in the instant case, duly published in
the official gazettes notifying the prices determined for
sugar of various grades and produced in various zones, and
applicable without exception to all producers failing within
well defined groups can be legitimately characterised as
legislative. No rule of natural justice is applicable to any
such order. [941H, 942A, 943B-C]

6. It is with reference to predetermined prices of
sugar that subsection (3-C) postulates the calculation of
the amount payable to each producer who has sold sugar in
compliance with an order made with reference to cl. (f) of
sub-s. (2). The calculation of such amount is in contradistinction to the determination of price of sugar, a _nonlegislative act. The individual orders to that effect being
administrative orders rounded on the mechanics of price
fixation, they must be left to the better instructed judgment of the executive, and in regard to them the principle
of audi alteram partem is not applicable- All that is
915
required is reasonableness and fair play which are in essence emanations from the doctrine of natural justice.

7.2 Where a question of law is at issue, the Court may determine the rightness of the decision of the
authority on its own independent judgment. If the decision does not agree with that which the Court
considers to be the right one, the finding of law by the authority is liable to be upset. Where it is a
finding of fact, the Court examines only the reason- ableness of the findings. When the finding is
found to be rational and reasonably based on evidence then judicial review is exhausted even though
the finding may not neces- sarily be what the Court would have come to as a trier of fact. [944C-E]
7.3 Whether an order is characterised as legislative or administrative or quasi-judicial, or, whether it
is a deter- mination of law or fact, the judgment of the expert body, entrusted with power, is
generally treated as final and the judicial function is exhausted when it is found to have warrant in

7.4 The orders, in the instant case, are undoubtedly based on an exhaustive study by experts. They
are fully supported by the recommendations of the Tariff Commission in 1969 and 1973 and are not
shown to be either discriminatory or unreasonable or arbitrary or ultra vires. [946D-E] 8.1 Judicial
review is not concerned with matters of economic policy. Nor is price fixation within the province of
the Courts. The Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature or its agents as to

matters within the province of either. The Court does not supplant the "feel of the experts" by its
own views. When the legis- lature acts within the sphere of its authority and delegates power to an
agent, it may empower the agent to make findings of fact which are conclusive provided such
findings satisfy the test of reasonableness and are consistent with the laws of the land. [948F, 949B,

economic considerations for the purpose of determining the price of sugar in terms of the said

in the absence of evidence to the con- trary, be characterised as arbitrary or unreasonable or not

by sub-section (3-C). [949E, 947B-D] The Panipat Cooperative Sugar Mills v. The Union of India,

matter for the Central Government to decide. What is best for the sugar industry and in what
manner the policy should be formulated and implemented, bearing in mind the fundamental object
of the statute, is again a matter for decision exclusively within the province of the Central
Government. Such matters do not ordinarily attract the power of judicial review. [949E-G] Secretary

F.S. Nariman, K.K. Venugopal, A.K. Verma, D.N. Mishra and S. Kachawa for the intervener in W.P.
No. 464/77. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by THOMMEN, J. The petitioners are owners
of sugar mills operating in the State of Uttar Pradesh in areas classified for the purpose of
determining the price of levy sugar as West and East Zones. They challenge the validity of notifications dated 28th November, 1974 and 11th July, 1975 (Annexures 8 & 9) issued by the Central
Government in exer- cise of its power under sub-section (3-C) of section 3 of the Essential
Commodities Act, 1955 (Act No. 10 of 1955), as amended to date (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act').
The petitioners do not, and cannot, challenge the validity of the subsection by reason of Article 3 1B
of the Constitution of India. By the impugned orders, the Central Government fixed the prices of
levy sugar for 1974-75 production. For the purpose of determining the prices, the country is divided into 16 zones, and the prices fixed for various grades of sugar in terms of section 3 (3-C) of the
Act vary from ' zone to zone. Prices are determined with reference to the
geographical-cum-agro-economic considerations and the aver- age cost profiles of factories located
in their respective zones. Each State for this purpose constitutes a separate zone, while U.P. is
divided into 3 zones and Bihar into 2 zones. The petitioners contend that these orders are ultra vires
the Act and violative of their fundamental fights as the prices of levy sugar have been determined
arbitrarily with reference to the average cost profiles of factories grouped together in zones without
regard to their individual capacity and cost characteristics. Such prices do not re- flect the actual
manufacturing cost of sugar incurred by producers like the petitioners or secure to them reasonable
returns on the capital employed by them. Geographical zon- ing, for the purpose of price fixation,
they point out, is an irrational’ and discriminatory system of (1) Published in the Gazette of India
Extraordinary dated 28.11.1974 and 11.7.1975.

averaging wide cost disparities amongst producers of widely varying capacity. Cost of manufacture
of sugar depends on a number of factors, such as recoveries from the sugarcanes, duration of the
crushing season, crushing capacity of the plant, the sugarcane price paid and the capital employed in
the manufacture of sugar. These factors vary from factory to factory. Fixation of the levy sugar prices
on zonal basis without regard to these divergent factors and the compara- tive cost profiles gives the
owners of bigger factories an undue advantage over producers like the petitioners whose factories
are comparatively of lower crushing capacity and whose manufacturing cost is consequently higher.
Clubbing of the petitioners’ factories with dissimilar factories in the same zones for the purpose of
price fixation is discrimina- tory, arbitrary and unreasonable. The petitioners point out that the
system of geographical zoning for the purpose of price determination has been severely criticised by
the Bureau of Industrial Costs & Prices (The "BICP") who have strongly recommended the division
of the sugar industry into groups of units having similar cost characteristics with particular
reference to recovery, duration, size and age of the unit and capital cost per tonne of output, and
irrespec- tive of their location.

The respondents, on the other hand, contend that the classification of sugar industry into 15 zones
(now 16) was upheld by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Anakapalle Co-operative Agricultural
& Industrial Society Ltd. etc. etc. v. Union of India & Ors., [1973] 2 SCR 882. The conten- tion that
the zonal system was discriminatory and violative of constitutional principles was pointedly urged,
but cate- gorically rejected by this 'Court. The method adopted by the Government in fixing the price
of levy sugar is fully sup- ported by the recommendations of various expert bodies. The Tariff

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 9Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

Commission in its 1973 Report recommended division of the country into 16 zones for this purpose.
The price of sugar is fixed with reference to the Cost Schedule recom- mended by that body. These
recommendations are based on various factors such as cost and output of individual la- bour, cane
price (accounting for about 70 per cent of the cost of sugar production), quality of sugarcane, taxes
on sugarcane, cost of other material, transport charges, cost of storing the sugar produced, cane
development charges and other overhead expenses, selling expenses etc. These factors are almost
identical for the entire zone.

The cost of manufacturing sugar, the respondents con- tend, depends not only on recovery from the
sugarcane, duration of crushing season, crushing capacity of the plant, the sugarcane price paid and
the capital employed, as stated by the petitioners, but also to a consider
able extent on the condition of the plant and machinery, quality of management, investment policy,
relations with cane growers and labour, financial reputation etc. They say: "It is evident from the
Tariff Commission Report of 1959, as also the Official Directory of the Bombay Stock Exchange, that
the petitioner Company has been consistently diverting huge amounts for investments running into
several lakhs elsewhere instead of ploughing back the same into the peti- tioner's sugar industry in
question. Thus, the petitioner Company has been neglecting the sugar factory and for such neglect of
their own they cannot blame the Zonal System."

Mr. Shanti Bhushan, appearing for the petitioners, does not object to the factories being grouped
together on the basis of factors common to them with a view to fixing the prices applicable to them
as a class of producers. He does not advocate fixation of price separately for each unit. He says that
the sugar factories must be grouped together, not on the basis of their geographical location, but
similarity in cost characteristics. He relies upon the 1976 Report of the BICP. The present system of
fixing prices according to the regions, where the factories are located, he says, is based on "averaging
wide cost disparities" as a result of which manufacturers like the petitioners incurring a high cost of
production and others incurring a low cost of pro- duction are treated alike. Such a system works to
the disad- vantage of the former and to the advantage of the latter. This, Mr. Shanti Bhushan
contends, is an unreasonable and invalid classification and violative of constitutional principles.
While this line of argument is supported by Mr. Raja Ram Agarwal, Mr. S.P. Gupta appearing for the
interven- er in Civil Writ Petition No. 464 of 1977 advocates aboli- tion of zonal classification or
grouping of any kind and supports fixation of price for each individual factory with reference to its
cost and regardless of any other considera- tion. Such unit-wise determination alone, according to
him, satisfies the requirements of Section 3(3-C). Any system of zoning or grouping for
determination of price, he contends, will fail to meet the norms of that sub-section. Mr. M .M. Abdul
Khader, on the other hand, submits that while averag- ing and costing with reference to a
representative cross- section may ordinarily be an appropriate method for deter- mining the fair
price, such a method is inappropriate for a small zone like Kerala where there are only three
manufac- turing units. In respect of such a zone, he says, unit-wise fixation of price is the only just
and proper method.

Mr. K.K. Venugopal, counsel for Indian Sugar Mills’ Association (ISMA), on the other hand,
supports the zoning system. He says that, except for a few producers like the petitioners, all the rest

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 10Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

of them in the country have ac- cepted the principle of zoning. In his written submissions, Mr.
Venugopal states as follows:

"As was seen during the course of hearing only 2 or 3 per- sons have come forward challenging
zoning. There are 389 sugar factories in the country and the present intervener has 166 members.
Besides there are 220 members with the cooperative sector. Their Association being National
Federa- tion of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd., has also inter- vened in these petitions and have
adopted the arguments of ISMA. Hence almost the entire industry has supported zoning and only a
handful of people who also factually are not high-cost units have opposed zoning."

Mr. Venugopal submits that the present case is squarely covered by the decisions of this Court in
Anakapalle Cooper- ative Agricultural & Industrial Society Ltd. etc. etc. v. Union of India & Ors.,
[1973] 2 SCR 882 and The Panipat Cooperative Sugar Mills v. The Union of India, [1973] 2 SCR

860. He says that the petitioners have not made out a case for reconsideration of these two
decisions. He refers to T. Govindaraja Mudaliar etc. etc. v. The State of Tamil Nadu & Ors., [1973] 3
SCR 222 at 228 to 230 and submits that this Court would not reexamine an earlier decision merely
because certain aspects of the question had not been noticed in that decision. Mr. Venugopal,
however, advocates neutralisation of the high cost incurred by the old units having lower crushing
capacity by giving them an incremental levy price as recommended by the High Level Committee in
1980. Before we examine the provisions of section 3(3-C) in the context of the general scheme of the
Act, we shall briefly refer to the observations of this Court in Anaka- palle, [1973] 2 SCR 882 and
Panipat, [1973] 2 SCR 860. Grover, J. speaking for the Bench in Anakapalle (supra) states’:

"The system of fixing the prices, according to certain regions or zones, is not a new one. The Tariff
Commission in 1959 favoured the formation of four zones. In the report of the Sugar Enquiry
Commission 1965 it was pointed out that the Government had actually fixed the prices for 22 zones
which meant that from four zones the number had been increased to twenty two or more. The
Commission was of the view that there should be five zones only in addition to Assam. The Tariff
Commission, 1969 however recommended the constitution of fifteen zones largely on State-wise
basis with an exception only in case of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Uttar Pradesh was divided into
three zones and Bihar into two. The Tariff Commission had been specifically requested to inquire
into the working of the zonal system, the main point for inquiry being the zones into which the sugar
producers should be grouped having regard to the basis of classification to be reeommended by the
Commission. The view of the Commission was that on the whole the number of price zones should
be fifteen which would reduce, though not eliminate, the inter-se anomalies in the cost structure
without resorting to the extreme of the fixation of price for each unit or a single or at the most two,
one for the sub-tropical and other for the tropical one. The Tariff Commission hoped that in the
course of time conditions would be created making the operation of the second alternative feasible."

Rejecting the contention that it was the zonal system that caused the losses allegedly incurred by
some of the sugar producers, Grover, J. says that ordinarily these units ought to have made profits.
The reasons for incurring losses can be many, such as inefficiency, failure to pursue the right policy,
poor management and planning etc., but these reasons have no relation to the zonal system. That

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 11Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

system by and large has led to efficiency and provides an incentive to cut down the cost. Healthy
competition among the units in the same zone should in the normal. course result in reduc- tion of
cost and greater efficiency in the operation of the units. It is proper management and planning that
would lead to the success of any commercial venture. The contention of the producers that they have
been incurring losses on ac- count of the zonal system is opposed to the evidence pro- duced by
them. The Court has rejected the extreme contention that prices should be fixed unitwise, i.e., on the
basis of actual cost incurred by each unit. Referring to this conten- tion, this Court observes:

"Apart from the impracticability of fixing the prices for each unit in the whole country, the entire
object and pur- pose of controlling prices would be defeated by the adoption of such a system."

Grover, J. states that, during the earlier period of price control, it was on an all India basis that the
price was fixed. That is still the objective. If such an objective is achieved, it would undoubtedly be
conducive to conferring proper benefit on the consumers. The objective of the Tariff Commission is
to have only two regions for the whole coun- try, viz., sub-tropical and tropical.

The Court has rejected as baseless the criticism against the principle of weighted average adopted in
the fixation of price in each zone. Such a principle is well recognised and acted upon by various
Sugar Enquiry Commissions. A proper cost study is intended to do justice to the weak and strong
alike. There is abundant justification for continuing and sustaining the zonal system. The varying
climatic conditions of each State have been taken into account. For the same reason, Bihar is divided
into 2 zones and U.P. into 3 zones, while, in the case of many other States, each State is treated as a
single zone. This system of zoning is thus adopted with special reference to climatic and
agro-economic conditions. Rejecting the contention that the zonal system has resulted in
discriminatory treatment, this Court states: "We are unable to hold that while classifying zones on
geographical-cum-agro-economic consideration, any discrimi- nation was made or that the price
fixation according to each zone taking into account all the relevant factors would give rise to such
discrimination as would attract Article 14 of the Constitution."

Even if there is no price control, the uneconomic units would be at a great disadvantage. The Court
states: "Even if there is no price control each unit will have to compete in the market and those units
which are uneconomic and whose cost is unduly high will have to compete with others which are
more efficient and the cost of which is much lower. It may be that uneconomic units may suffer
losses but what they cannot achieve in the open market they cannot insist on where price has to be
fixed by the govern- ment. The Sugar Enquiry Commission in its 1965 report ex- pressed the view
that "cost-plus" basis of price fixation perpetuates inefficiency in the industry and is, therefore,
against the long-term interest of the country." Considering the general principle involved in price
fixa- tion, the Court states:

"It is not therefore possible to say that the principles which the Tariff Commission followed in fixing
the prices for different zones are either not recognised as valid principles for fixing prices or that
simply because in case of some factories the actual cost was higher than the one fixed for the zone in
which that factory was situate the fixation of price became illegal and was not in accordance with the
provisions of sub-section (3-C). It has not been denied that the majority of sugar producers have

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 42Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

made prof- its on the whole and have not suffered losses. It is only some of them which assert that
their actual cost is far in excess of the price fixed. That can hardly be a ground for striking down the
price fixed for the entire zone provided it has been done in accordance with the accepted principles

"

The Court concludes:

"When prices have to be fixed not for each unit but for a particular region or zone the method
employed by the Commis- sion was the only practical one and even if some units because of
circumstances peculiar to them suffered a loss the price could not be so fixed as to cover their loss.
That cannot possibly be the intention of the Parliament while enacting sub-section (3-C) of section 3
of the Act. If that were so the price fixation on zonal or regional basis would have to be completely
eliminated. In other words, the entire system of price control which is contemplated wilt break down
because fixation of price for each unit apart from being impractical would have no meaning
whatsoever and would not be conducive to the interest of the consumer. '' This Court has thus in
Anakapalle (supra) rejected the argument that the alleged loss incurred by certain sugar producers
is attributable to fixation of price on a zonal basis; or the zonal system has led to inefficiency or lack
of incentive, or it has resulted in unequal or unfair treat- ment. On the other hand, the zonal system
has encouraged a healthy competition amongst the units in the same zone. Unit-wise fixation is
impracticable. The Tariff Commission is the best judge in selecting units for cost study to determine
the average cost. The fair price has to be deter- mined with reference to the conditions of a
representative cross section of the industry. For all these reasons, there is ample justification in
continuing and sustaining the zonal system for the purpose of price fixation. Price has to be fixed for
each zone and necessarily it varies from zone to zone. There is no discrimination in the classification
of zones on a geographical-cum-agro-economic consideration and any such classification is perfectly
consistent with the principle of equality.

In Panipat, [1973] 2 SCR 860, Shelat, J. speaking for the same Constitution Bench that has decided
Anakapalle, [1973] 2 SCR 882, referes to the norms adopted in sub-sec- tion (3-C), viz., (a)
determination by the Government of the "price of sugar", and (b) payment of "an amount" to the
manufacturer, and states that the concept of fair price which is what is referred to in sub-section
(3-C) as "price of sugar" does not by any account mean the actual cost of production of every
individual manufacturer. Such price has to be arrived at by a process of costing with reference to a
representative cross section of the manufacturing units. He states:

"The basis of a fair price would have to be built on a reasonably efficient and economic
representative crosssec- tion on whose workings cost-schedules would have been worked out and
the price to be determined by Government under sub- section (3-C) would have to be built."

So stating, Shelat, J. rejects the contention that such price has to be determined unit-wise. Any such
fixation of price, he points out, would be contrary to the concept of partial control postulated by the
subsection and would perpetuate inefficiency and mismanagement. But, of course, any such price,
he hastens to add, has to be fixed reasona- bly and on relevant considerations. Referring to the
policy of partial control, Shelat, J. states:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 13Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

a the Central Government was confronted with two main problems (a) deterioration in the sugar
industry, and

(b) the conflicting interests of the manufacturer, the consumer and the cane grower. The floor price
of cane fixed by Government was intended to protect the farmer from ex- ploitation, but that was
found not to be an incentive enough to induce him to increase his acreage. A device had to be found
under which a price higher than the minimum could be paid by the manufacturer of sugar. The
consumer, on the other hand, had also to be protected against the spiralling of sugar price and his
needs, growing as they were, had to be satisfied at some reasonable price."

Shelat, J. emphasises the need to modernise the factories which alone would yield a reasonable
return. This is what he states:

‘Both these and a larger production of sugar would not be possible unless there was a reasonable
return which would ensure expansion, which again would not be possible unless new machinery for
such expansion was brought in and facto- ries, particularly in U.P. and Bihar, were modernised and
renovated. A fair price for sugar, therefore, had to be such as would harmonise and satisfy at least to
a reasonable extent these conflicting interests."

Significantly, the BICP's recommendation to group indi- vidual units having homogenity in cost,
irrespective of their location, was not accepted by the Central Government, particularly because the
Tariff Commission itself had con- sidered the question and reached the conclusion that geographical-cum-agro-economic considerations demanded the grouping of factories with reference to
State zones, or subzones as in the case of U.P. and Bihar. To group them on the basis of their
location in various regions of the coun- try for the purpose of price fixation is a rational method
reflecting economic realities. This is particularly so as conditions generally vary from State to State
as regards the availability and quality of sugarcane, labour conditions and other factors, whereas
within the same region like facili- ties are generally available to all factories. If the cost structure
varies from factory to factory, such variation is not necessarily caused by the non-availability, or the
poor quality of raw material, or the labour conditions, but probably for reasons unconnected with
them, such as the age of the plant, availability of finance, management ability, etc. There is great
force in the submission of the respond- ents that to group together factories having a high cost
profile and to determine a price specially applicable to them is, as recognised by this Court in
Panipat (supra) and Anakapalle (supra), to put a premium on incompetence, if not mismanagement.

The history of control over sugar has been set out at length in Panipat (supra) and we do not wish to
burden this judgment with a narration of the circumstances which have led to the introduction of
partial control under which 60% of the output of sugar is acquired and the balance left for free sale.
It is in implementation of this policy that sub- section (3-C) of section 3 was inserted2 Before we
examine the

2. For an illuminating discussion of this aspect, See A.M. Khusro, Price Policy, Lancer International
(1987), p. 62-63:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 14Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

provisions of that sub-section under which the impugned notification have been issued, we shall
refer to the statu- tory scheme.

The Act was, as stated in the preamble, enacted by Parliament "to provide, in the interest of the
general public, for the control of the production, supply and dis- tribution of, and trade and
commerce in, certain commodi- ties". The entire Act is devoted to the cause of the general public
with a view to achieving equitable distribution of essential commodities at fair prices.

Section 3 of the Act confers wide power upon the Central Government to control production, supply,
distribution, etc., of essential commodities. It reads:

"3. Powers to control production, supply, distribution, etc., of essential commodities--(1) If the
Central Govern- ment is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or
increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and
availability at fair prices or for securing any essential commodity for the defence of India or the
efficient conduct of military operations, it may, by order, provide for regu- lating or prohibiting the
production, supply and distribu- tion thereof and trade and commerce therein."

Sub-section (2) of section 3 says that, without preju- dice to the generality of the powers conferred
by sub-sec- tion (1), an order made "After many years of adverse experience a new strategy of dual
pricing was introduced in sugar. The mills were asked to deliver to the public distribution system
about 60 per cent of their output say at Rs.2 per Kg. and were allowed to sell the balance of 40 per
cent in the free market at say Rs.6 per kg. The mills were delighted to do so as they got very much
enhanced receipts from their flee- market sales. With larger receipts they offered in the following
season a higher price to the farmer (the sugarcane grower) who, in turn, grew and offered more
cane. In other words, the law of supply which had been held captive, as it were, was freed from
bondage. With a higher price offer from the mills, the cane growers brought more land under sugarcane, diverted land from other crops to cane, used more inputs, produced and delivered to the mills
more cane and in fact diverted cane deliveries from the open-pan system to the mill system. Having
thus obtained much more cane, the mills produced much more sugar and sold 30-40 per cent of it in
the free market. Within a year or two, the free-market price of sugar fell from Rs.6 to Rs.3 or even
Rs.2.50. At this rate consumers began to buy more in the free market, millions of ration cards
remained unused and the demands on the public distribution declined substantially. Prolonged
shortages of sugar got converted into a relative abundance."

under that sub-section may provide for the matters specified in subsection (2). One of them is what
is contained in clause (f) of sub-. section (2) which empowers the Central Government to require any
person dealing in any essential commodity to sell the whole or a specified part of such commodity to
the Central Government or the State Government or to a nominee of such Government. It reads:
"(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub-section (1), an order made
thereunder may provide
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 15Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

(f) for requiring any person holding in stock, or engaged in the production, or in the business of
buying or selling of any essential commodity ,-
(a) to sell the whole or a specified part of the quantity held in stock or produced or received by him,
or

(b) in the case of any such commodity which is likely to be produced or received by him, to sell the
whole or a speci- fied part of such commodity when produced or received by him, to the Central
Government or a State Government or to an officer or agent of such Government or to a Corporation
owned or controlled by such Government or to such other person or class of persons and in such
circumstances as may be specified in the order."

The power contained in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) is exercisable by an order. An 'order' is
defined under section 2 to include a direction issued thereunder. Any order made under section 3 by
the Central Government or by an officer or authority of the Central Government is re- quired by
sub-section (6) of section 3 to be laid before both Houses of Parliament, as soon as may be, after it is
made. Any order made under section 3 which is of a general nature or affecting a class of persons
has to be notified in the official gazette. [Subsection (5) of section 3].

Sub-section (3) of section 3 provides that where any person has sold any essential commodity (sugar
being such a commodity) in compliance with an order made with reference to clause (f) of
sub-section (2), he shall be paid the price of the goods purchased from him as provided under
clauses

(a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (3). This subsection oper- ates only where an order has been made
under sub-section (1) with reference to clause (f) of sub-section (2). While clause (a) of the
sub-section postulates an agreed price, consistently with the controlled price, if any, clause (b)
speaks of a price calculated with reference to the con- trolled price, if any, when no agreement is
reached. Where neither clause (a) nor clause (b) applies, either because there is no agreement or
because there is no controlled price, the seller has to be paid, as per clause (c), a price calculated at
the market rate prevailing in the locality at the date of the sale.

Sub-section (3-A) empowers the Central Government to regulate in accordance with the provisions
of the sub-sec- tion the price of any foodstuff sold in a locality in com- pliance with an order made
with reference to clause (f) of sub-section (2). This power is exercisable by a direction which has to
be duly notified in the official Gazette. The power to issue the direction is notwithstanding anything
contained in sub-section (3). Before issuing the notifica- tion, the Central Government has to form
an opinion that the price of any foodstuff (including sugar) has to be regulated for the purpose of
cotrolling the rise in its prices or preventing its hoarding in any locality. Any such notifica- tion will
remain in force for any specified period not exceeding 3 months. The price payable in such cases is
either the agreed price consistently with the controlled price, if any, or where no such agreement is
possible, the price calculated with reference to the controlled price, if any, or where neither of these
two methods is applicable, the price calculated with reference to the average market rate prevailing
in the locality during the period of 3 months immediately prior to the date of the notification. The

average market rate will be determined by an officer authorised by the Central Government and the
rate so deter- mined by him is not liable to be questioned in any court. Sub-section (3-C) which is
the crucial provision, was inserted in 1967. It reads:

"(3-C). Where any producer is required by an order made with reference to clause (f) of sub-section
(2) to sell any kind of sugar (whether to the Central Government or a State Government or to an
officer or agent of such Govern
ment or to any other person or class of persons) and either no notification in respect of such sugar
has been issued under sub-section (3-A) or any such notification, having been issued, has ceased to
remain in force by efflux ot time, then, notwithstanding, anything contained in sub- section (3),
there shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore which shall be calculated with reference to
such price of sugar as the Central Government may, by order, determine, having regard to-
(a) the minimum price, if any, fixed for sugarcane by the Central Government under this section;
(b) the manufacturing cost of sugar;
(c) the duty or tax, if any, paid or payable thereon; and

(d) the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing
sugar, and different prices may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different
factories or for different kinds of sugar.

Explanation--For the purposes of this sub-section, "produc- er" means a person carrying on the
business of manufacturing sugar."

(emphasis supplied) Sub-Section (3-C) is attracted whenever any producer is required to sell sugar
by an order made with reference to sub-section (2)(f) and no notification has been issued under
sub-section (3-A) or any such notification, having been issued, has ceased to be in force. Whenever
sub-section (3- C) is attracted, it operates notwithstanding anything con- tained in sub-section (3).
This means the compensation payable to the seller in the circumstances attracting sub- section (3-C)
is not the price postulated in sub-section (3). Nor is it the price mentioned under sub-section (3A),
for that sub-section cannot be in operation when sub-section (3-C) is attracted. What is payable
under sub-sectin (3-C) is an "amount" calculated with reference to the "price of sugar" determined
in the manner indicated in that sub-sec- tion.

Construing sub-section (3-C), this Court in Panipat [1973] 2 SCR 860,870 says:

"Sub-section 3C, with which we are presently concerned was inserted in sec. 3 by sec. 3 of Act 36 of
1967. The sub- section lays down two conditions which must exist before it applies. The first is that
there must be an order made with reference to sub-section 2 cl. (f), and the second is that there is no
notification under sub-section 3A or if any such notification has been issued it is no longer in force
owing to efflux of time. Next, the words "notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section"

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 17Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

suggest that the amount payable to the person required to sell his stock of sugar would be with
reference to the price fixed under the subsection and not the agreed price or the market price in the
absence of any controlled price under sub-sec. 3A. The sub-section then lays down two things;
firstly, that where a producer is required by an order with reference to sub-sec. 2(f) to sell any kind
of sugar, there shall be paid to that producer' an amount therefore, that is for such stock of sugar as
is required to be sold, and secondly, that such amount shall be calculated with reference to such
price of sugar as the Central Government may, by order, determine, having regard to the four factors
set out in cls. (a), (b), (c) and (d). Unlike the preceding three sub-sections under which the amount
payable is either the agreed price, or the controlled price, or where neither of these prices is
applicable at the market or average market price, the amount in respect of sugar required to be sold
is to be calculated at the price determined by th Central Government...... "

What is specially significant is that sub-section (3-C) postulates payment of an amount to the
producer who has been required to sell sugar in the circumstances mentioned there- in. What is
required to be paid to him is not the price of sugar, but only an amount. That amount has to be
calculated with reference to the price of sugar. The "price" is deter- mined by the Central
Government by means of an order which, as required by sub-sections (5) and (6), has to be notified
in the official gazette and laid before both Houses of Parliament. The order notifying the "price of
sugar" is of general application and it is the rate at which the actual "amount" payable to each seller
is calculated. The price of sugar must be determined by the Central Govern
ment having regard to the factors mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) of sub-section (3~C). This is done
with reference to the industry as a whole and not with reference to any indi- vidual seller. In
contradistinction to the "price of sugar", the "amount" is calculated with reference to the particular
seller. The Central Government is authorised to determine different prices for different areas or for
different facto- ries or for different kinds of sugar. Whether factories are required to be grouped
together for a rational determination of the prices according to their location or their size, age and
capacity or by any other standard is a matter for deci- sion by the Central Government on the basis
of relevant material. What is contemplated by the legislature in dele- gating such wide discretion to
the Central Government is that it must apply its mind to the manifold questions rele- vant to the
determination of prices and with due regard to the norms laid down in the sub-section. What is
required by sub-section (3-C) is the adoption of a valid classification of factories having a rational
nexus to the object sought to be achieved, viz., determination of a fair price of sugar with reference
to which the actual amounts payable to the producers, in the circumstances attracting the
sub-section, are calculated.

Referring to the legislative background of sub-section (3-C), this Court in Panipat (supra) observes:
"In order to appreciate the meaning of cls. (a), (b), (c) and (d), it must be remembered that ever
since control on sugar was imposed, Government had set up expert committees to work out
cost-schedules and fairprices. Starting in the beginning with an All-India cost-schedule worked out
on the basis of the total production of sugar, the factories were later grouped together into zones or
regions and different cost-schedules for different zones or regions were con- structed on the basis of
which fair prices were worked out at which sugar was distributed and sold. The Tariff Commis- sion
in 1958 and the Sugar Enquiry Commission in 1965 had worked out the zonal cost-schedules on the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 18Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

basis of averaged recovery and duration, the minimum and not the actual price of cane, the averaged
conversion costs and recommended a reasonable return on the capital employed by the industry in
the business of manufacturing sugar. This experience was before the legislature at the time when
subsec. 3C was inserted in the Act. The legislature therefore incorporated the same formula in the
new sub-section as the basis for working out the price. The purpose behind enacting the new
sub-section was three-fold, to provide an incentive to increase production of sugar, encourage
expan- sion of the industry, to devise a means by which the cane producer could get a share in the
profits of the industry through prices for his cane higher than the minimum price fixed and secure to
the consumer distribution of at least a reasonable quantity of sugar at a fair price. '' Clauses (a) to
(d) of sub-section (3-C) postulate that the price of sugar must be determined having regard to the
minimum price, if any, fixed for sugarcane by the Central Government, the manufacturing cost of
sugar, the duty or tax applicable in the zone, and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital
employed in the business of manufac- turing sugar. Referring to clause (d) of sub-section (3-C), this
Court observes in Panipat (supra):

"It is clear from the reports of the Tariff Commission that a reasonable return recommended by that
body at a fixed amount of Rs. 10.50 per quintal which worked out in 196667 at 12.5% per annum was
not in respect of levy sugar only but on the whole, so that even if such a return was not obtain- able
on levy sugar but was obtainable on the whole, it would meet the requirement of cl. (d). In this
conclusion we derive a two-fold support, firstly, from the language used in cl. (d) itself, viz., a
reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar, which must
mean the business as a whole and not the business of manu- facturing levy sugar only, and secondly,
from the fact of the Commission having all along used the same phraseology while recommending
Rs. 10.50 per quintal as an addition by way of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the
industry. The cost-schedules prepared by these bodies were for determining a fair price in relation
to the entire sugar produced by the industry and the return which should be granted to it on the
capital employed in the industry and not with respect to that stock only required to be sold under
sub-sec. 2(f). This is clear from the heading of Ch. 9 of the Tariff Commission's report, 1969, "Cost

wn

Structure and Price Fixation".

The petitioners contend that although the Government has the discretion to fix different prices for
different areas or for different factories, or for different kinds of sugar, such wide dis- cretion has to
be reasonably exercised. It is, of course, a well accepted principle that any discretion conferred on
the executive has to be reasonably exercised. Nevertheless, it is a discretion which the Court will not
curtail unless the exercise of it is impeachable on well accepted grounds such as ‘ultra vires' or
‘unreasonableness'.

The petitioners further contend that the Act requires the Government to have regard to clauses (a)
to (d) and, therefore, it is mandatory on the part of the Government to act strictly in compliance
with the provisions of those clauses in determining the prices. According to them, "having regard to"
is a mandatory requirement demanding strict compliance with the provisions to which reference is
made by the legislature. They say that the ingredients of clauses (a) to (d) must be examined with
reference to each producer as a condition precedent to the determination of the price of sugar.

We may in this connection point out that the petitioners have not furnished any data to show that
the prices deter- mined by the Government would have been different had the ingredients of clauses
(a) to (d) of the sub-section been examined with reference to each individual producer instead of a
representative cross section of manufacturing units. Be that as it may, the expression "having regard
to" must be understood in the context in which it is used in the stat- ute. See Union of India v.
Kamlabhai Harjiwandas Parekh & Ors., [1968] 1 SCR 463 at 471. These words do not mean that the
Government cannot, after taking into account the matters mentioned in clauses (a) to (d), consider
any other matter which may be relevant. The expression is not "having regard only to" but "having
regard to". These words are not a fetter; they are not words of limitation, but of general guidance to
make an estimate. The Government must, of course, address itself to the questions to which it must
have regard, and, having done so, it is for the Government to determine what it is empowered to
determine with refer- ence to what it reasonably consider to be relevant for the purpose. The
Judicial Committee in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Williamson Diamonds Ltd., L.R. 1958 A.C.
41, 49 observed with reference to the expression "having regard to":

"The form of words used no doubt lends itself to the sugges- tion that regard should be paid only to
the two matters mentioned, but it appears to their Lordships that it is impossible to arrive at a
conclusion as to reasonableness by considering the two matters mentioned isolated from other
relevant factors. Moreover, the statute does not say "having regard only" to losses previously
incurred by the company and to the smallness of the profits made. No answer, which can be said to
be in any measure adequate, can be given to the question of "unreasonableness" by considering
these two matters alone ...... "

See Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal, Calcutta v. Gungadhar Banerjee and Co. (P) Ltd.,
[1965] 3 SCR 439 at 444-45. See also Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. etc. v. Union of India,
[1975] 1 SCR 956 at 959. In State of Karna- taka and Anr. etc. v. Shri Ranganatha Reddy & Anr. etc.,
[1978] 1 SCR 641 at 657-58 this Court stated: "The content and purport of the expressions "having
regard to" and "shall have regard to" have been the subject matter of consideration in various
decisions of the Courts in England as also in this country. We may refer only to a few. In Illingworth
v. Welmsley, [1900] 2 Q.B. 142 it was held by the Court of Appeal, to quote a few words from the
judgment of Romer C.J. at page 144: "All that clause 2 means is that the tribunal assessing the
compensation is to bear in mind and have regard to the average weekly wages earned before and
after the accident respectively. Beating that in mind, a limit is placed on the amount of
compensation that may be awarded ..... "In another decision of the Court of Appeal in Perry v.
Wright (etc. etc.), [1908] 1 K.B. 441 Cozens- Hardy M.R. observed at page 451: "No mandatory
words are there used; the phrase is simply "regard may be had". The sentence is not grammatical,
but I think the meaning is this: Where you cannot compute you must estimate, as best as you can,
the rate per week at which the workman was being remunerated, and to assist you in making an
estimate you may have regard to analogous cases." It is worthwhile to quote a few words from the
judgment of Fletcher Moulton L.J. at page

458. Under the phrase "Regard may be had to" the facts which the Court may thus take cognizance
of are to be "a guide, and not a fetter". This Court speaking through one of us (Beg, J., as he then

was), has expressed the same opinion in the case of Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. etc. v. Union

of India, [1975] 1 SCR 956. Says the learned Judge at page 959: "The expression "having regard to"
only obliges the Government to consider as relevant data material to which it must have regard"."

In State of U.P. & Ors. v. Renusagar Power Co., [1988] 4 SCC 59, one of us (Mukhariji, J., as he then
was) observed: "The expression "having regard to" only obliges the govern- ment to consider as
relevant data material to which it must have regard ....."

In O'May and Ors. v. City of London Real Property Co. Ltd., [1982] 1 All E.R. 660 at 665 (H.L.), Lord
Hailsham stated: "A certain amount of discussion took place in argument as to the meaning of
‘having regard to' in s. 35. Despite the fact that the phrase has only just been used by the draftsman
of s. 34 in an almost mandatory sense, I do not in any way suggest that the court is intended or
should in any way attempt to bind the parties to the terms of the current tenancy in any permanent
form.....".

The words "having regard to" in the sub-section are the legislative instruction for the general
guidance of the Government in determining the price of sugar. They are not strictly mandatory, but
in essence directory. The reasona- bleness of the order made by the Government in exercise of its
power under sub-section (3-C) will, of course, be tested by asking the question whether or not the
matters mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) have been generally considered by the Government in
making its estimate of the price, but the Court will not strictly scrutinise the extent to which those
matters or any other matters have been taken into account. There is sufficient compliance with the
sub-section, if the Government has addressed its mind to the factors mentioned in clauses (a) to (d),
amongst other factors which the Government may reasonably consider to be relevant and has come
to a conclusion, which any reasonable person, placed in the position of the Government, would have
come to. On such determination of the price of sugar, which, as stated in Panipat (supra) is the fair
price, the sub-section postu- lates the calculation of an amount, with reference to such price, for
payment to each producer who has complied with an order made with reference to sub-section
(2)(f). The "price of sugar", unlike the "amount" is arrived at by a process of costing in respect of a
representative cross section of manufacturing units, beating, of course, in mind the legis- lative
instruction contained in clauses (a) to (d). The Attorney General submits that orders determining
the prices of sugar in terms of the sub-section are of general application and, therefore, legislative in
character. Omis- sion, if any, to consider the peculiar problems of individu- al producers is not a
ground for judicial review. The peti- tioners' counsel as well as Mr. Venugopal appearing for the
intervener (ISMA), do not agree. They submit that the sub- section contemplates only
administrative or quasi-judicial orders of particular application and the impugned orders are not
legislative. They rely upon a certain observation of this Court in Union of India & Anr. v. Cynamide
India Ltd. & Anr., [1987] 2 SCC 720. Mr. Venugopal, however, hastens to add that his client does not
seek personal heating before prices are determined. Mr. B.R.L. Iyengar, supporting the contentions
of the petitioners, points out that the expres- sion 'determine' used in sub-section (3-C) indicates
that the order to which that expression refers is quasi-judicial. Judicial decisions are made
according to law while administrative decisions emanate from administrative policy. Quasi-judicial
decisions are also administrative decisions, but they are subject to some measure of judicial
procedure, such as rules of natural justice. To distinguish clearly legislative and administrative
functions is "difficult in theory and impossible in practice".3 Referring to these two functions, Wade

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 21Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

says:

‘They are easy enough to distinguish at the extremities of the spectrum: an Act of Parliament is
legislative and a deportation order is administrative. But in between is a wide area where either label
could be used according to taste, for example where ministers make orders or regula- tions affecting
large numbers of people ..... ,, .4 Wade points out that legislative power is the power to prescribe the
law for people in general, while administra- tive power is the power to prescribe the law for them, or
apply the law to them, in particular situations. A scheme for centralising the electricity supply
undertakings may be called administrative, but it might be just as well legisla- tive. Same is the case
with ministerial orders establishing new towns or airports etc. He asks: "And what of ‘directions of a
general character’ given by a minister to a nationa- lised industry? Are these various orders
legislative or administrative?" Wade says that the correct (3) Comd. 4060 (1932), p. 73; see H.W.R.
Wade-Adminis- trative Law, 6th ed., p. 47 (4) Ibid p. 848.

answer would be that they are both. He says:" ..... there is an infinite series of gradations, with a
large area of overlap, between what is plainly legislation and what is plainly administration".5
Courts, nevertheless, for practi- cal reasons, have distinguished legislative orders from the rest of
the orders by reference to the principle that the former is of general application. They are made
formally by publication and for general guidance with reference to which individual decisions are
taken in particular situations. According to Griffith and Street, an instruction may be treated as
legislative even when they are not issued formal- ly),, but by a circular or a letter or the like. What
mat- ters is the substance and not the form, or the name. The learned authors say: ". .... where a
Minister (or other authority) is given power in a statute or an instrument to exercise executive, as
opposed to legislative, powers--as, for example, to requisition property or to issue a licence--and
delegates those powers generally, then any instructions which he gives to his delegates may be
legisla- tive".6 Where an authority to whom power is delegated is entitled to sub-delegate his power,
be it legislative, executive or judicial, then such authority may also give instructions to his delegates
and these instructions may be regarded as legislative. However, as pointed out by Denning, L.J., (as
he then was) a judicial tribunal cannot delegate its functions except when it is authorised to do so
express- ly or by necessary implication’ see Bernard and Ors. v. National Dock Labour Board and
Ors., [1953] 2 Q.B. 18 at 40. Kenneth Culp Davis says: "What distinguishes legislation from
adjudication is that the former affects the rights of individuals in the abstract and must be applied in
a further proceeding before the legal position of any particular individual will be definitely touched
by it; while adjudica- tion operates concretely upon individuals in their individu- al capacity".7
Justice Holmes' definition, which is what is called the "time test" and which Davis describes as one
which has produced many unsatisfactory practical results, reads:

"A judicial inquiry investigates, declares, and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past
facts and under laws supposed already to exist. That is its purpose and end. Legislation, on the other

hand, looks to the future and (5) Ibid.

changes existing conditions by making a new rule, to be applied thereafter to all or some part of
those subject to its power. The establishment of a rate is the making of a rule for the future, and
therefore is an act legislative, not judicial ......

Prentis v. Atlantic Cost Line Co., 211 US 210,226. The element of general application is often cited as
a distinct feature of legislative activity. In the words of Chief Justice Burger, "rule-making is
normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all
members of a broadly identifiable class"? Bernard Schwarts says: "an adjudication, on the other
hand, applies to specific individuals or situations. Rule-making affects the fights of individuals in the
abstract and must be applied in a further proceeding before the legal position of any particular
individual will be definitely affected; adjudication operates concretely upon individuals in their
individual capacity"9 According to Schwartz, the "time test" and the "applicability test" are workable
in most cases although in certain situations distinctions are indeed difficult to draw.

A statutory instrument (such as a rule, order or regula- tion) emanates from the exercise of
delegated legislative power which is the part of the administrative process resem- bling enactment of
law by the legislature. A quasi judicial order emanates from adjudication which is the part of the
administrative process resembling a judicial decision by a court of law. This analogy is imperfect
and perhaps unhelp- ful in classifying borderline or mixed cases which are better left unclassified .10
If a particular function is termed legislative rather than judicial, practical results may follow as far as
the parties are concerned. When the function is treated as legislative, a party affected by the order
has no fight to notice and heating, unless, of course, the statute so re- quires. It being of general
application engulfing a wide sweep of powers, applicable to all persons and situations of a broadly
identifiable class, the legislative order may not be vulnerable to challenge merely by reason of its
omission to take into account individual peculiarities and differ- ences amongst those falling within
the class. (8) Quoted by Bernard Schwartz in ‘Administrative Law' (1976), p. 144.

(9) Ibid (10) See Davis, Administrative Law Text, p. 123 In Union of India & Anr. v. Cynamide India
Ltd. & Anr., [1987] 2 SCC 720 at 734-35, Chinnappa Reddy, J. referring to the earlier decisions of
this Court states: "..... legislative action, plenary or subordinate, is not subject to .rules of natural
justice. In the case of Parlia- mentary legislation, the proposition is self-evident. In the case of
subordinate legislation, it may happen that Parlia- ment may itself provide for a notice and for a
hearing .......... But where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing, no one
can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity
seseeneees It is true that, with the proliferation of delegated legislation, there is a tendency for the line
between legislation and administration to vanish into an illusion. Administrative, quasi-judicial
decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and, con- versely, legislative activity tends to fade into
and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi-judicial activi- ty".

Stating that rule-making is of general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class while
adjudication is applicable to specific individuals or situations, the learned Judge observes:

"A price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or
producer. It is generally in relation to a particular commodity or class of commodities or

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 23Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

transactions. It is a direction of a general character, not directed against a particular situation. It is
intended to operate in the future. It is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public. The
right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the State to so provide
them are transformed into the power of the State to fix prices and the obligations of the producer to
charge no more than the price fixed. Viewed from whatever angle, the angle of general application,
the prospectiveness of its effect, the public interest served, and the rights and obligations flowing
therefrom, there can be no question that price fixation is ordinarily a legisla- tive activity".

The learned Judge emphasises:

"Price fixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi-judicial character when it relates
to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix
the price separately in relation to such individuals. Such situations may arise when the owner of
property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the government or its nominee and
the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined accord- ing to the statutory
guidelines laid down by it. In such situations the determination of price may acquire a quasijudicial character".

These observations have been cited with approval by one of uS (Sabyasachi Mukharji, J., as he then
was) in Renusagar (supra).

In Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. etc. v. Union of India, [1975] 1 SCR 956 at 961, this Court
states: "Price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative measure even though it may be based
upon objective criteria found in a report or other material. It could not, there- fore, give rise to a
complaint that a rule of natural jus- tice has not been followed in fixing the price". In Prag Ice & Oil
Mills & Anr. etc. v. Union of India, [1978] 3 SCR 293 at 317, Chandrachud, J., as he then was, speaks
for the majority:

"We think that unless, by the terms of a particular statute, or order. price fixation is made a
quasi-judicial function for specified purposes or cases, it is really legislative in character in the type
of control order which is now before us because it satisfies the tests of legislation. A legisla- tive
measure does not concern itself with the facts of an individual case. It is meant to lay down a general
rule applicable to all persons or objects or transactions of a particular kind or class".

& Ors., [1972] 3 All ER 1019 at 1024.

The impugned orders, duly published in the official gazettes notifying the prices determined for
sugar of var- ious grades and pro
duced in various zones, and applicable to all producers of such sugar, can, in our view, be
legitimately characterised as legislative. These orders are required by Sub-section (6) to be laid
before both Houses of Parliament. The notified prices are applicable without exception to all
persons falling within well defined groups. The prices are deter- mined in accordance with the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 24Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

norms postulated in the sub- section. It is with reference to such predetermined prices of sugar that
the "amount" payable to each producer, who has sold sugar in compliance with an order made with
reference to clause (f) of sub-section (2), is calculated. The calcu- lation of such amount is, in
contradistinction to the deter- mination of "price of sugar", a non-legislative act. Thus, while
individual consideration is relevant to the calculation of the "amount", it is not so for the determination of the "price of sugar" which is the rate at which the amount is calculated. That price, as stated
in Panipat (supra) is to be arrived at by a process of costing with reference to a reasonably efficient
and economic representa- tive cross section of manufacturing units. In this connection, we must
point out that at first blush a certain observation of Chinnappa Reddy, J. in Cyna- mide, [1987] 2
SCC 720 at 741, on which much reliance is placed by the petitioners’ counsel, appears to be
inconsist- ent with what we have now stated. The learned Judge says: "The Order made under
Section 3(2)(c), which is not in respect of a single transaction, nor directed to a particu- lar
individual is clearly a legislative act, while an Order made under Section 3(3-C) which is in respect
of a particu- lar transaction of compulsory sale from a specific individu- al is a non-legislative act".

It would appear that what the learned Judge had in mind was an order by which the "amount" was
calculated in terms of sub-section (3-C) in respect of each individual producer and not an order
determining the "price of sugar". While the former is non-legislative, the latter, by the very test
adopted by the learned Judge, is legislative in character. We, therefore, understand the observation
of the learned Judge on this point as applicable only to the individual order fixing the "amount" in
terms of the sub-section and not to orders determining the "price of sugar" which are what the
impugned orders are. Any other construction of the sub-section would conflict with what was
adopted by the Constitution Bench in Panipat (supra) and would, therefore, be unsustainable.

The individual orders, calculating the "amounts" payable to the individual producers, being
administrative, orders rounded on the machanics of price fixation, they must be left to the better
instructed judgment of the executive, and in regard to them the principle of audi alteram partem is
not applicable. All that is required is reasonableness and fair play which are in essence emanations
from the doctrine of natural justice as explained by this Court in A.K. Krai- pak & Ors. etc. v. Union
of India & Ors., [1970] 1 SCR 457. See also the observation of Mukhariji, J., as he then was, in
Renusagar, [1988] 4 SCC 103, 105.

Price fixation is in the nature of a legislative action even when it is based on objective criteria
rounded on relevant material. No rule at natural justice is applicable to any such order. It is
nevertheless imperative that the action of the authority should be inspired by reason. Saras- wati
Industrial Syndicate Ltd., [1975] 1 SCR 956, 961, 962. The Government cannot fix any arbitrary
price. It cannot fix prices on extraneous considerations: Renusagar, (supra). Any arbitrary action,
whether in the nature of a legis- lative or administrative or quasi-judicial exercise of power, is liable
to attract the prohibition of Article 14 of the Constitution. As stated in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil
Nadu & Anr., [1974] 2 SCR 348, "equality and arbi- trariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the
rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch." Unguided
and unrestricted power is af- fected by the vice of discrimination: Mrs. Maneka Gandhi v. Union of
India & Anr., [1978] 1 SCC 248 at 293-294. The principle of equality enshrined in Article 14 must
guide every state action, whether it be legislative, executive, or quasi-judicial: Ramana Dayaram

Power delegated by statute is limited by its terms and subordinate to its objects. The delegate must
act in good faith, reasonably, intra vires the power granted, and on relevant consideration of
material facts. All his decisions, whether characterised as legislative or administrative or
quasi-judicial, must be in harmony with the Constitution and other laws of the land. They must be
"reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation". See Leila Mourn- ing v. Family
Publications Service, 411 US 356, 36 L Ed. 2d

318. If they are manifestly unjust or oppressive or outra- geous or directed to an unauthorised end
or do not tend in some degree to the accomplishment of the objects of delegation, courts might well
say, "Parlia- ment never intended to give authority to make such rules; they are unreasonable and
ultra vires". per Lord Russel of Killowen, C.J. in Kruse v. Johnson, [1988] 2 Q.B. 91, 99. The
doctrine of judicial review implies that the reposi- tory of power acts within the bounds of the power
delegated and he does not abuse his power. He must act reasonably and in good faith. It is not only
sufficient that an instrument is intra vires the parent Act, but it must also be consist- ent with the
constitutional principles: Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, [1978] 1 SCC 248, 314-315.

Where a question of law is at issue, the Court may determine the rightness of the impugned decision
on its own independent judgment. If the decision of the authority does not agree with that which the
Court considers to be the right one, the finding of law by the authority is liable to be upset. Where it
is a finding of fact, the Court examines only the reasonableness of the finding. When that finding is
found to be rational and reasonably based on evidence, in the sense that all relevant material has
been taken into account and no irrelevant material has influenced the deci- sion, and the decision is
one which any reasonably minded person acting on such evidence, would have come to, then judicial
review is exhausted even though the finding may not necessarily be what the Court would have come
to as a trier of fact. Whether an order is characterised as legislative or administrative or
quasi-judicial, or, whether it is a deter- mination or law or fact, the judgment of the expert body,
entrusted with power, is generally treated as final and the judicial function is exhausted when it is
found to have "wanant in the record" and a rational basis in law: See Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United
States, [1939] 307 U.S. 125, 83 L. Ed. 1147. See also Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v.
Wednesbury Corporation, [1948] 1 K.B. 223. As stated by Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone L.C.,
(H.L.) in Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans, [1982] 1 WLR 1155 at 1160-61:

"The function of the court is to see that lawful authority is not abused by unfair treatment and not tO
attempt itself the task entrusted to that authority by the law........... The purpose of judicial review is
to ensure that the indi- vidual receives fair treatment, and not to ensure that the authority, after
according fair treatment, reaches on a matter which it is authorised by law to decide for itself a
conclu- sion which is correct in the eyes of the court". In the same case Lord Brightman says:

"Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in
which the decision was made".

A repository of power acts ultra vires either when he acts in excess of his power in the narrow sense
or when he abuses his power by acting in bad faith or for an inadmissi- ble purpose or on irrelevant
grounds or without regard to relevant considerations or with gross unreasonableness. See
Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation, [1948] 1 K.B. 223. In the
words of Lord Mac- naghten in Westminster Corporation v. London and North Western ' Railway,
[1905] AC 426, 430:

wees It is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers such as those conferred upon
the Corporation must take care not to exceed or abuse its pow- ers. It must keep within the limits of
the authority commit- ted to it. It must act in good faith. And it must act rea- sonably. The last
proposition is involved in the second, if not in the first.....".

In The Barium Chemicals Ltd. & Anr. v. The Company Law Board & Ors., [1966] Supp. SCR 311, this
Court states: " ..... Even if (the statutory order) is passed in good faith and with the best of intention
to further the purpose of the legislation which confers the powers, since the Authority has to act in
accordance with and within the limits of that legislation, its order can also be challenged if it is
beyond those limits or is passed on grounds extra- neous to the legislation or if there are no grounds
at all for passing it or if the grounds are such that no one can reasonably arrive at the opinion or
satisfaction requisite under the legislation. In any one of these situations it can well be said that the
authority did not honestly form its opinion or that in forming it, it did not apply its mind to the
relevant facts"..

In Renusagar, [1988] 4 SCC 59, 104, Mukharji, J., as he then was, states:

"The exercise of power whether legislative or administrative will be set aside if there is manifest
error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary. Similarly, if
the power has been exercised on a non-consideration or non-application of mind to relevant factors
the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous. If a power (whether legislative or
administra- tive) is exercised on the oasis of facts which do not exist and which are patently
erroneous, such exercise of power will stand vitiated".

The true position, therefore, is that any act of the repository of power, whether legislative or
administrative or quasi-judicial, is open to challenge if it is in conflict with the Constitution or the
governing Act or the general principles of the law of the land or it is so arbitrary or unreasonable
that no fair minded authority could ever have made it The impugned orders are undoubtedly based
on an exhaus- tive study by experts. They are fully supported by the recommendations of the Tariff
Commission in 1969 and 1973. It is true that these recommendations in some respects were the
subject matter of criticism by a subsequently appointed expert body, viz., the BICP. Apart from the
fact that the BICP's criticism has not been accepted by the Government, that criticism is not relevant
in so far as the impugned orders are concerned because the latter are in regard to an earlier period.
These orders are fully supported by the relevant material on record. The conclusions reached by the
Central Government in exercise of its statutory power are expert conclusions which are not shown to
be either discrim- inatory or unreasonable or arbitrary or ultra vires. The (11) See the observation of

material brought to our notice by the petitioners does not support the arguments at the bar that the
Central Government has not applied its mind to the relevant questions to which they are expected to
have regard in terms of the statute. That the sugar factories for the purpose of determining the price
of sugar in terms of sub-section (3-C) should be grouped on the basis of their geographical location
is a policy decision based on exhaustive expert conclusions. Factories are classified with due regard
to geographi- cal-cumagro-economic considerations. Fair prices for differ- ent grades of sugar are
determined for each zone with refer- ence to a reasonably efficient and economic representative
cross-section of the manufacturing units. Such classifica- tion, as held in Panipat (supra) and
Anakapalle (supra) cannot, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be characterised as arbitrary
or unreasonable or not rounded on an intelligible differentia having a rational nexus with the object
sought to be achieved by subsection (3-C). The person assailing such classification "carries the heavy
burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its
consequences" Federal Power Commission v. Hope Gas Co., 320 US 591, 602 (1944). If the
petitioners nevertheless incur losses, such losses need not necessarily have arisen by reason of
geographical zoning, but for reasons totally unconnected with it, such as the condition of the plant
and machinery, quality of management, investment policy, labour relations, etc. These are matters
on which the petitioners have not furnished data, and, in any event judicial review is hardly
appropriate for their consideration.

In this connection we would recall the observations of Chinnappa Reddy, J. in Union of India and
Anr. v. Cynamide India Ltd. andAnr., [1987] 2 SCC 720 at p. 736: "We do not agree with the basic
premises that price fixation primarily affects manufacturers and producers. Those who are most
vitally affected are the consumer public. It is for their protection that price fixation is resorted to and
any increase in price affects them as seriously as any decrease does a manufacturer, if not more."

In M/s. Gupta Sugar Works v. State of U.P. and Ors., [1987] Supp. SCC 476 at p. 48 1 one of us
(Jagannatha Shetty, J .) stated:

"In this view of the matter, the primary consideration in the fixation of price would be the interest of
consumers rather than that of the producers."

The Court has neither the means nor the knowledge to reevaluate the factual basis of the impugned
orders. The Court, in exercise of judicial review, is not concerned with the correctness of the findings

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 28Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

of fact on the basis of which the orders are made so long as those findings are reasonably supported
by evidence. In the words of Justice Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court in Railroad Commission
of Texas v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Company, 311 US 570-577, 85 L. ed. 358,362:

"Nothing in the Constitution warrants a rejection of these expert conclusions. Nor, on the basis of
intrinsic skills and equipment, are the federal courts qualified to set their independent judgment on
such matters against that of the chosen state authorities ..... When we consider the limit- ing
conditions of litigation--the adaptability of the judi- cial process only to issues definitely
circumscribed and susceptible of being judged by the techniques and criteria within the special
competence of lawyers--it is clear that the Due Process Clause does not require the feel of the expert
to be supplanted by an independent view of judges on the conflicting testimony and prophecies and
impressions of expert witnesses".

This observation is of even greater significance in the absence of a Due Process Clause.

Judicial review is not concerned with matters of econom- ic policy. The Court does not substitute its
judgment for that of the legislature or its agents as to matters within the province of either. The
Court does not supplant the "feel of the expert" by its own views. When the legislature acts within
the sphere of its authority and delegates power to an agent, it may empower the agent to make
findings of fact which are conclusive provided such findings satisfy the test of reasonable~ ness. In
all such cases, judicial in- quiry is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are
reasonably based on evidence and whether such findings are consistent with the laws of the land. As
rated by Jagannatha Shetty, J. in M/s. Gupta Sugar Works, (supra): "the court does not act like a
chartered accountant nor acts like an income tax officer. The court is not concerned with any
individual case or any particular problem. The court only examines whether the price determined
was with due regard to considerations provided by the statute. And wheth- er extraneous matters
have been excluded from determination."

Price fixation is not within the province of the courts. Judicial function in respect of such matters is
exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclu- sions reached by the concerned
authority. As stated by Justice Cardozo in Mississippi Valley Barge Line Company v. United States of
America, 292 US 282-290, 78 Led 1260, 1265: "The structure of a rate schedule calls in peculiar
measure for the use of that enlightened judgment which the Commis- sion by training and
experience is qualified to form ..... It is not the province of a court to absorb this function to itself .....
The judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions
approved by the administrative body".

It is a matter of policy and planning for the Central Government to decide whether it would be on
adoption of a system of partial control, in the best economic interest of the sugar industry and the
general public that the sugar factories are grouped together with reference to geographical-cum-agro-economic factors for the purpose of determining the price of levy sugar. Sufficient
power has been delegated to the Central Government to formulate and implement its policy decision
by means of statutory instruments and execu- tive orders. Whether the policy should be altered to
divide the sugar industry into groups of units with similar cost characteristics with particular

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/682224/ 29Shri Sitaram Sugar Company ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 13 March, 1990

reference to recovery, duration, size and age of the units and capital cost per tonne of output,
without regard to their location, as recom- mended by the BICP, is again a matter for the Central
Gov- ernment to decide. What is best for the sugar industry and in what manner the policy should
be formulated and imple- mented, bearing in mind the fundamental object of the stat- ute, viz.,
supply and equitable distribution of essential commodity at fair prices in the best interest of the
general public, is a matter for decision exclusively within the province of the Central Government.
Such matters do not ordinarily attract the power of judicial review. We would, in this connection,
recall the words of Jus- tice Frankfurter in Secretary of Agriculture, etc. v. Cen- tral Roig Refining
Com
pany, etc., 338 US 615-617, 94 Led 391-392:

"Congress was ..... confronted with the formula- tion of policy peculiarly with its wide swath of
discretion. It would be a singular intrusion of the judiciary into the legislative process to extrapolate
restrictions upon the formulation of such an economic policy from those deeply rooted notions of
justice which the Due Process Clause expresses .....".

"Suffice it to say that since Congress fixed the quotas on a historical basis it is not for this Court to
reweigh the relevant factors and, perchance, substitute its notion of expediency and fairness for that
of Congress. This is so even though the quotas thus fixed may demonstrably be disadvantageous to
certain areas or persons. This Court is not a tribunal for relief from the crudities and inequities of
complicated experimental economic legislation". It is important to remember that the division of the
industry on a zonal basis for the purpose of price determi- nation has been accepted without
question by almost all the producers with the exception of a few like the petitioners. Even if it is true
that the petitioners as individuals are at a disadvantage and have suffered losses on account of the
present system--an assertion which has not been established and which by its very nature is
incapable of determination by judicial review--that is not sufficient ground for inter- ference with
the impugned orders. We are not satisfied that the decisions of this Court in Anakapalle, [1973] 2
SCR 882 and Panipat, [1973] 2 SCR 860 require reconsideration in any respect. We see no merit in
the challenge against the im- pugned orders. The civil writ petitions are, in the circum- stances,
dismissed. However, we do not make any order as to costs.

HEADNOTE:

Over the last several years a large number of
appointments were made to Class III and IV services in the
two appellant State on ad hoc basis, i.e., without reference
to Public Service Commission or the Subordinate Services
Selection Board and without adhering to employment exchange
requirement. As a result, a large number of ad _ hoc
employees were continuing for several years without being
regularised and were agitating for their regularisation. To

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

meet the situation, both the appellant Governments issued
orders from time to time for regularisation of such
employees subject to certain conditions.

In pursuance of these orders a number of persons, who
satisfied the conditions prescribed in each of those order s
were regularised, but many could not be, for the reason that
they did not satisfy one or the other of the conditions
prescribed in the said orders. They were, however, allowed
to continue in service. This category of people approached
the High Court praying for issuance of writ, order or
direction for regularisation of their service. They
contended that the conditions in the said orders were
arbitrary, discriminatory and unrelated to the object.

The work-charged employees, daily-wagers, casual labour
and those

827
employed in temporary/time-bound projects also approached
the High Court for regularisation of their services. Some

of the petitioners also pleaded for equal pay for equal
work.

Accepting the pleas of the petitioners, the High Court
gave certain directions to the appellant-States for
regularisation of these employees.

Aggrieved by the High Court's orders, the two appellant
States filed appeals before this Court. Some of the
employees also filed Writ Petitions before this Court
directly, contending that they too were governed by the
directions given by the High Court and that they should be
given the benefit of the same.

On behalf of the appellants the validity and
correctness of the directions given by the High Court were
questioned on the grounds that the High Court had exceeded
its jurisdiction in virtually amending the Government orders
and was not justified in holding that the fixation of a
particular date in the respective Government orders was
arbitrary and/or that it was unrelated to the object sought
to be achieved; that the High Court also erred in holding
that the requirement of having been sponsored by the
Employment Exchange was invalid; that the High Court was not
justified in directing that all persons who had put in one
year's service should be regularised unconditionally; and
that such a direction would given rise to several
difficulties and complications for the administration, that
there could be a direction for regularisation, without a
post or a vacancy and the Government could not be directed
to create posts without number, and it was beyond the
capacity of any Government to comply with such directions;
that the direction with respect to work-charged
establishment, casual labour and daily wagers equally
unsustainable in law; that the rule prescribing minimum
qualifying service of one year in one State could not be
thrust upon the other State; that because of the directions
in question, while regularly selected persons would be kept

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

out of jobs, unqualified ineligible persons who had come
through back door and whose records of service might also
not be satisfactory would be regularised at one go and the
rule of reservation would also be violated and that it was
the prerogative of the Executive to create and abolish
posts, and that the Government could not be compelled to
create posts where there was no need for such posts or where
the need is no longer there.
828

It was contended on behalf of the respondents and the
writ petitioners that the directions had been given with a
view to curb the arbitrariness of the authorities and with a
view to give a satisfactory solution to a human problem
created by the policies of the Governments themselves, that
the work-charged employees should be treated on par with adhoc employees and ought to be regularised on the Ist of
April of each year, and all those persons who where working
in the permanent posts ought to be regularised.

Disposing of the cases, this Court,

HELD : 1.1. Ordinarily speaking, the creation and
abolition of a post is the prerogative of the Executive. It
is the Executive again that lays down the conditions of
service subject, of course, to a law made by the appropriate

legislature. This power to prescribe the conditions of
service can be exercised either by making Rules under the
proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution or (in the

absence of such Rules) by issuing Rules/Instructions in
exercise of its executive power. The court comes into the
picture only to ensure observance of fundamental rights,
statutory provisions, Rules and other instructions, if any,
governing the conditions of service. The main concern of
the court in such matters is to ensure the Rule of law and
to see that the executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal
to its employees consistent with the requirements’ of
Articles 14 and 16. It also means that the State should not
exploit its employees nor should it seek to take advantage
of the helplessness and misery of either the unemployed
persons or the employees, as the case may be. [847 F-H]

1.2. The State must be a model employer. It is for this
reason it is held that equal pay must be given for equal
work, which is indeed one of the directive principles of the
Constitution and that a person should not be kept in a
temporary or ad hoc status for long. [848A]

1.3. Where a temporary or ad hoc appointment is
continued for long, the court presumes that there is need
and warrant for a regular post and accordingly directs
regularisation. While all the situations in which the court
May act to ensure fairness cannot be detailed, it is
sufficient to indicate that the guiding principles are the
ones indicated above. [848B]

2.1. The court must, while giving directions, act with
due care and caution. It must first ascertain the relevant
facts, and must be cognizant of the several situations and
eventualities that may arise on account of such directions.
A practical and pragmatic view has to be taken, inasmuch as
every such direction not only tells upon the public
exchequer but also has the effect of increasing the cadre
strength of a particular service, class or category.
[852A,B]

2.2. In the instant case apart from the fact that the
High Court was not right in holding that the several
conditions imposed by the two Governments in their
respective orders relating to regularisation were arbitrary,
not valid and justified, it acted rather hastily in
directing wholesome regularisation of all such persons who
have — put in one year's service, and that too
unconditionally. Several problems will arise if such
directions become the norm. Therefore, there is need for
fulled consideration and due circumspection while giving
such directions. [852C]

3.1. The Government orders in question were issued by
the Government from time to time. These orders are not in
the nature of a statute which is applicable to all existing
and future situations. They were issued to meet a given
situation facing the Government at a given point of time. In
the circumstances, therefore, there was nothing wrong in
prescribing a particular date by which the specified period
of service (whether it is one year or two years) ought to
have been put in. [853G]

3.2. The first order dated 1st January, 1980 issued by
one of the States says, a person must have completed two
years of service as on 31st December, 1979, i.e., the day
previous to the issuance of the order. It cannot be said
that fixing of such a date is arbitrary and unreasonable.
Similarly, the order dated 3rd January, 1983 fixes 15th
September, 1982 as the relevant date. This
notification/order does two things. Firstly, it excludes
Class III posts of clerks from the purview of the S.S.S.B.
in case of those who have completed a minimum of two years
of service as on 15th September, 1982, and secondly, it
provides for their regularisation subject to certain
conditions. No particular attack was made as to this date
in the High Court. Consequently, the Government had no
opportunity of explaining as to why this particular date was
fixed. Without giving such an opportunity it cannot be held
that the fixation of the said date is arbitrary.

830
What is more relevant is that the High Court has not held
that this particular date is arbitrary. According to it,
fixation of any date whatsoever was arbitrary, because, in
its opinion, the order must say that any and every person

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

who completes the prescribed period of service must be
regularised on completion of such period of service. The
next order dated 24th March, 1987 prescribes the date as
31.12.1986. i.e., the end of the previous year. In the
circumstances, there is no basis for holding that fixation
of the date can be held to be arbitrary in the facts and
circumstances of the case. [854A-D]

1367 and Inder Pal Yadav & Ors. etc. v. Union of India &
Ors. etc., [1985] 3 S.C.R. 837, referred to.

3.3. The Government orders say that all those who had
been sponsored by Employment Exchange or had been appointed
after issuing a public advertisement alone be regularised.
There is no unreasonableness or invalidity in the same. It
is a reasonable and wholesome provision and a_ requirement
designed to curb and discourage back door entry’ and
irregular appointments and ought not to have _ been
invalidated. Moreover, these are not cases where the writ
petitioners were appointed only after obtaining a _nonavailability certificate from the Employment Exchange.
[855E-F]

Union of India v. Hargopal, 1987 S.C. 1227, referred to.

3.4. The further requirement prescribed in the orders,
viz., that the employees must have possessed the prescribed
qualifications for the post at the time of his appointment
on ad hoc basis is equally a valid condition. [855G-H]

3.5. The High Court was not justified in holding that
inasmuch as the two States were sister States and because
prior to 1966 one State was a part of the other State, the
rule relating to length of service requisite for
regularisation should be uniform in both the States. They
are two different States having their own Governments;
merely because one Government chooses to say that one year's
temporary ad hoc service is enough for regularisation it
cannot be said that the other State must also prescribe the
very same period or that it cannot prescribe a longer or
shorter period. The fact that there is a single High Court
for both the States and

831
the Union Territory of Chandigarh is no ground for saying
that the orders issued by them should be uniform. [856A-C]

3.6. It is not necessary to alter or modify the
directions of the High Court, in so far as one of the States
was concerned, that Class III and IV posts which were within
the purview of the S.S.S.B. should equally be within the
purview of regularisation orders issued by it. If any of the
petitioners have been excluded from consideration (for
regularisation) on the basis that most of the Class III and
IV posts were kept out of the purview of the S.S.S.B. they
may be considered and appropriate orders passed. [856D-E]

3.7. The High Court was also not justified in giving the
direction that all those ad hoc/temporary employees who had
continued for more than one year should be regularised. The

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

direction has been given without reference to the existence
of a vacancy. It, in effect, means that every ad
hoc/temporary employee who has been continued for one year
should be regularised even though (a) no vacancy’ is
available for him - which means creation of a vacancy (b) he
was not sponsored by the Employment Exchange nor was he
appointed in pursuance of a notification calling for
applications which means he had entered by a back-door (c)
he was not eligible and/or qualified for the post at the
time of his appointment and (d) his record of service since
his appointment is not satisfactory. Moreover, from the
mere continuation of an ad hoc employee for one year, it
cannot be presumed that there is need for a regular post.
Such a presumption may be justified only when such
continuance extends to several years. Further, there can be
no “rule of thumb' in such matters. Conditions and
circumstances of one unit may not be the same as of the
other. Just because in one case, a direction was given to
regularise employees who have put in one year's service as
far as possible and subject to fulfilling the
qualifications, it cannot be held that in each and every
case such a direction must follow irrespective of and
without taking into account the other relevant circumstances
and considerations. The relief must be moulded in each case
having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances of
that case. It cannot be a mechanical act but a judicious
one. Judged from this stand point, the directions under
challenge must be held to be totally untenable and
unsustainable. [856F-H; 857A-C]
3.8. So far as the members of the work-charged establishment
are

832
concerned, though the work-charged employees are denied
certain benefits, they are industrial workers and are
entitled to the benefits of the provisions contained in the
Industrial Disputes Act. Their rights flow from that special
enactment under which even contracts of employment are open
to adjustment and modification. The work-charged employees,
therefore, are in a better position than temporary servants
like the other petitioners who are liable to be thrown out
of employment without any kind of compensatory benefits.
[857D, 858A-B]

Jaswant Singh v. Union of India, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 426,
referred to.

3.9. In view of the orders issued on 24th March, 1987
and 6th April, 1990 by one of the States, the direction
given by the High Court becomes unnecessary. Though no
orders have been issued in this regard by the other States,
a scheme of regularisation of these employees is stated to
have been prepared by that State in pursuance of the
judgment under challenge. The said scheme is, however, not
made conditional upon the result of these appeals against
the judgment. The scheme is a reasonably fair one. It is

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

hoped and trusted that irrespective of the result of these
appeals, the said scheme would be given effect to by the
other State concerned. [858C-D]

3.10. The High Court has directed that all those
employees who fell within the definition of ‘workmen
contained in the Industrial Disputes Act would also be
entitled to regularisation on par with the work-charged
employees and that they should be regularised on completing
five years of service in one State and four years of
service in the other State. This direction is given in
favour of those casual labour and daily wagers who fall
within the definition of workmen. Insofar as work-charged
employees, daily-wage workers and casual labourers who did
not fall within the definition of work-men are concerned,
the High Court has directed their regularisation on
completion of one year's service. This direction is as
untenable as in the case of ad hoc/temporary employees. The
direction regarding persons belonging to the above
categories and who fall within the definition of workmen,
the terms in which the direction has been given cannot be
sustained. While it is true that persons belonging to these
categories continuing over a number of years have a right to
claim regularisation and the authorities are under an
obligation to consider their case for regularisation in a
fair manner, keeping in view the prin
833
ciples enunciated by this Court, the blanket direction given
cannot be sustained. However, in view of the orders of one
of the State Governments contained in the letter dated
6.4.1990 which provided for regularisation of these persons
on completion of ten years, no further directions are called
for at this stage. The other State Government, of course,
has not issued any such orders governing these categories.
Accordingly, the State Government concerned should verify
the vacancy position in the categories of daily-wagers and
casual labour and frame a scheme of absorption in a fair and
just manner providing for regularisation of these persons,
having regard to their length of service and other relevant
conditions. As many persons as possible shall be absorbed.
The scheme should be framed within six months. [858F-H; 859
A-C]

4. Further orders had been issued by one of the State
Governments, after the filing of the writ petitions and
during the pendency of the Special Leave Petitions in this
Court for regularisation of ad hoc/work-charged employees.
The other State Government has agreed by an affidavit before
this Court, to adopt the same mutatis mutandis so far as
Class III employees are concerned. It is hoped that many of
the employees would get regularised under the orders
aforementioned issued by both the Governments. [859D, 865F,
867E]

Sade The instant case is not a case where’ the
Governments have failed to take any steps for regularisation

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

of their ad hoc employees working over the years. Every few
years they have been issuing orders providing for
regularisation. In such a case, there is no occasion for the
court to issue any directions for regularising such
employees more particularly when none of the _ conditions
prescribed in the said orders can be said to be either
unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. The court cannot
obviously help those who cannot get regularised under these
orders for their failure to satisfy the conditions
prescribed therein. Issuing general declaration of
indulgence is no part of jurisdiction of this Court. In case
of such persons it is for the respective Governments to
consider the feasibility of giving them appropriate relief,
particularly in case where persons have been continuing over
a long number of years, and were eligible and qualified on
the date of their ad hoc appointment and further whose
record of service is satisfactory. [867 F-H]

5.2. The normal rule, is regular recruitment through the
prescribed

834

agency but exigencies of administration may sometimes call
for an ad hoc or temporary appointment to be made. In such a
situation, effort should always be to replace such an ad
hoc/temporary employee by a regularly selected employee as
early as possible. Such a temporary employee may also
compete along with others for such regular
selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and good,
but if he does not, he must give way to the regularly
selected candidate. The appointment of the regularly
selected candidate. The appointment of the regularly
selected candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance
for the sake of such an ad hoc/temporary employee. Secondly,
an ad hoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by
another ad hoc or temporary employee; he must be replaced
only by a regularly selected employee. This is necessary to
avoid arbitrary action on the part of the appointing
authority. Thirdly, even where an ad hoc or _ temporary
employment is necessitated on account of the exigencies of
administration, he should ordinarily be drawn from the
employment exchange unless it cannot brook delay in which
case the pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no
candidate is available or is not sponsored by the employment
exchange, some appropriate method consistent with the
requirements of Article 16 should be followed. In other
words, there must be a notice published in the appropriate
Manner calling for applications and all those who apply in
response thereto should be considered fairly. An unqualified
person ought to be appointed only when qualified persons are
not available through the above processes. If for any
reason an ad hoc or temporary employee is continued for a
fairly long spell, the authorities must consider his case
for regularisation provide he is eligible and qualified
according to rules and his service record is satisfactory

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

and his appointment does not run counter to the reservation
policy of the State. [868D-H; 869A-C]

5.3. The proper course would be that each State prepares
a scheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation
of such employees consistent with its reservation policy and
if a scheme is already framed, the same may be made
consistent with the observations herein so as to reduce
avoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when such person
is regularised he should be placed immediately below the
last regularly appointed employee in that category, class or
service, as the case may be. [869D]

5.4. So far as the work-charged employees and casual
labour are concerned, the effort must be to regularise them
as far as possible and as

835
early as possible subject to their fulfilling the
qualification, if any, prescribed for the post and subject
also to availability of work. If a casual labourer is
continued for a fairly long spell - say two or three years a presumption may arise that there is regular need for his
services. In such a situation it becomes obligatory for the
concerned authority to examine the feasibility of his
regularisation. While doing so, the authorities ought to
adopt a positive approach coupled with an empathy for the
person. Security of tenure is necessary for an employee to
give his best to the job. In this behalf, this Court
commends the orders of one of the State Governments,
contained in its letter dated 6.4.1990 both in relation to
work-charged employees as well as casual labour. [869 E-G]

5.5. The orders issued by both the Governments providing
for regularisation of ad hoc/temporary employees who have
put in two years/one year of service are quite generous and
leave no room for any legitimate grievance by any one.
[869H]

5.6. These observations are not exhaustive nor can they
be understood as immutable. Each Government or authority has
to devise its own criteria or principles for regularisation
having regard to all the relevant circumstances, but while
doing so, it should bear in mind the observations made
herein. [870 A-B]

6.1. So far as the employees and workmen employed by
Statutory/Public Corporations are concerned, they have not
issued any orders akin to those issued by the two State
Governments. Even so, it is but appropriate that they adopt
as far as possible, keeping the exigencies and requirements
of their administration in view, the criteria and principles
underlying the orders issued by their Government in the
matter of regularisation and pass appropriate orders. The
orders contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990, as
supplemented by the orders in the Notification dated
28.2.1991 issued by one of the States should be followed by
the Statutory/Public Corporations located in that State,
whereas the Statutory/Public Corporations located in the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

other State should follow the criteria and principles stated
in the affidavit of the Government of that State filed
before this Court. [870 C-D]

6.2. These directions would not, however, apply to these
Statutory/Public Corporations, functioning within these
States as are under the control of the Government of India.
These Corporations would evolve an

836
appropriate policy of regularisation in the light of this
judgment, if they have not already evolved one, or make
their existing policy consistent with the judgment to avoid
litigation. [870E]

7. As regards, equal pay for equal work, the judgment is
singularly devoid of discussion. The direction given by the
High Court is totally vague. It does not make it clear who
will get what pay and on what basis. Hence, this direction
is set aside.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by B.P. JEEVAN REDDY,J. 1. This batch of Special Leave
Petitions are directed against the judgment of a Division Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court
in a batch of writ petitions, the first among them being Writ Petition (C) No. 72 of 1988 (Piara Singh
and Anr. v. State of Haryana and Ors.). A large number of writ petitions arising both the States of
Punjab and Haryana were heard together and a common judgment delivered giving certain
directions in the matter of regularisation of the adhoc/temporary employees, members of work
charged establishments, daily-wagers, casual labour and those engaged temporarily in temporary
schemes. We have heard all the counsel appearing in this batch at quite some length.

Leave granted in all the Special Leave Petitions.

2. Over the last several years a large number of appointments were made to Class III and IV services
in the States of Punjab and Haryana on ad hoc basis i.e., without reference to Public Service
Commission or the Subordinate Services Selection Board and without adhering to employment
exchange requirements. They were initially appointed for a period of six months or so but were
continued for years together under orders passed from time to time. (In so far as the State of
Haryana is concerned, most of the class III posts in the Education Department were kept out of the
purview of the S.S.S.B. during the period 1970 to 1987. For a period of 10 years, it is stated, there
was no Board in existence in the State. Only in March 1987, almost all the posts in Education
Department and other Departments were brought within the purview of the S.S.S.B.). As a result of
the above policy, a large number of ad hoc employees came into existence in both the States, who
were continuing over several years without being regularised and were agitating for their
regularisation. To meet the situation, both the Governments issued orders from time to time for
regularisation of such employees subject to certain conditions. The orders issued by the Government
of Punjab are the following:

1. 3.3.1969 Regularisation of ad _ hoc

years service on
1.4.1985.

Ts 8.8.1985 Modifying the order issued
on 29.3.1985 and

directing that all Class
III ad hoc employees having
one year service on

1.4.1985 may be
regularised.
8. 1.9.1986 Regularisation of Class

III ad hoc employees
appointed after 1.4.1984.

The orders are issued by the Government of Haryana are the following:

S.No. Date of issue Substance of Order
1 2 3
1 1.1.1980 Regularisation of all Class

III ad hoc employees who
have completed two years
service on 31.3.1979.

2. 3.1.1983 Regularisation of ad _ hoc
Clerks in Class III who
have completed two years
service on 15.9.1982.

Bs 19.1.1984 Regularisation of Class
III ad hoc employees who
have completed two years
of service on 15.9.1982.
(The employees who were
left out in the orders
dt. 3.1.1983 were brought
within the purview. of
this order.)

4. 15.2.1987 Regularisation of all
Class III ad hoc
employees other than
teachers working against
posts which have been
taken out of the
purview of the S.S.S.B.
and who have completed
two years service on
1.11.1986.

In pursuance of the above orders a number of persons who satisfied the conditions prescribed in
each of those orders were regularised but many could not be. Their services could not be regularised
for the reason that they did not satisfy one or the other of the conditions prescribed in the said
orders. They were, however, allowed to continue in service. It is this category of people who
approached the High Court of Punjab and Haryana praying for issuance of Writ, Order of Direction

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 42State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

for regularisation of their service.

3. At this stage, it would be appropriate to notice the conditions prescribed by the aforesaid orders
which were not satisfied by the writ petitioners and on account of which they were not regularised.
The order of the Government of Haryana dated ist January, 1980 prescribed the following
conditions for regularisation:

(1) He must have put in a minimum service to two years on 31.12.1979.
(2) He must have been recruited through the Employment Exchange.
(3) The service and conduct of such employee should be of an overall good category.

(4) He must have possessed the prescribed qualifications for the post at the time of his appointment
on ad hoc basis. In the Order dated 3rd January 1983, a further condition, besides the aforesaid
conditions, was imposed viz., that the employee must belong to the category for which the post
stands reserved.

Similarly in the Order dated 29th March, 1985 issued in the case of Government of Punjab (issued
by the President of India) the conditions prescribed were the following:

(1) He must have completed a minimum of two years service on 1st April, 1985.

(2) He must have fulfilled the conditions for eligibility (academic qualifications, experience and age)
at the time of his first adhoc/temporary appointment. (3) He must have been recruited through the
Employment Exchange or by open advertisement.

(4) His record of service has been satisfactory. (5) He is found medically fit for entering the
Government service; his character and antecedent have been duly verified and found suitable for
Government service. (6) A regular post/vacancy is available for regularisation.

(7) He has been found fit for regularisation by the Departmental Selection Committee.

(8) Among the persons regularised, interse seniority would be observed. All these persons would be
placed junior to those working on regular basis.

These are the conditions common to all the orders issued from time to time by the Government of
Punjab and Haryana. Only those ad hoc/temporary employees who could not be regularised for
want of satisfying one or the other of the conditions prescribed in the respective orders that had
approached the High Court by way of Writ Petitions. They contended that the conditions prescribed
in the said orders were arbitrary, discriminatory and unrelated to the object. It is this contention
which was examined at some length and accepted by the high court.

4. Besides the ad hoc/temporary employees, certain other categories of persons also approached the
High Court whose cases too have been dealt with in the judgment under appeal. They are
work-charged employees daily-wagers, casual labour and those employed in temporary/time-bound
projects. They too wanted to be regularised. A plea of equal pay for equal work was also advanced by
certain petitioners. These pleas too were considered and upheld.

5. The reasons for which the High Court held the conditions prescribed in the orders of
regularisation aforementioned, as bad are to the following effect:

(a) VALIDITY OF FIXING A PARTICULAR DATE BY WHICH THE SPECIFIED PERIOD OF
SERVICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. The High Court held, "there is no magic in fixing a
date by which an employee was to complete the prescribed tenure of service for
regularisation....... fixing of a date has no reasonable basis or intelligible differentia for the object to
achieve......following that view (the view taken by this Court in Inder Pal Yadav, [1985] 3 S.C.R. 837)
we hold that the dates fixed for the policies of regularisation of the two Governments are
discriminatory....... we hold that the various dates fixed from time to time in their regularisation
policies are hit by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India."

(b) VALIDITY OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
SPONSORED BY EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGE.

The High Court held that this Court has, in the Union of India v. Hargopal (1987 S.C. 1227), held
that "if at a given moment suitable candidates amongst candidates sponsored by the Employment
Exchanges are not available or no candidate has been sponsored by the Employment Exchange and
recruitment is made on ad hoc basis from the sources other than employment exchange, it cannot be
said in regularisation policy that such candidates would not be entitled to be regularised. The basic
policy decision is that ad hoc employees who have worked for quite some time and have gained
experience should be regularised and in case they are shunted out, hardship would be caused in
numerous ways....... we find no justification in the policy of regularisation that the candidates
sponsored through the Employment Exchanges alone would be entitled to regularisation." No
finding was, however, recorded that the petitioners or any of them were appointed without reference
to the Employment Exchange only after the Employment Exchange intimated the concerned
authority that no suitable candidate is available with it.

(c) VALIDITY OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE CON
CERNED POSTS SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF S.S.S.B. The High Court held that
inasmuch as most of the Class III and Class IV posts were kept out of the purview of the S.S.S.B. in
the State of Haryana during the period 1970 to March, 1987 and also because for a period of ten
years there was no S.S.S.B. in existence in this State, imposition of this condition by the Government
of Haryana is unreasonable and arbitrary.

6. Having expressed the opinions above-mentioned, the High Court referred to certain decisions of
this Court and of its own, and expressed the view that continuing employees on adhoc basis for more

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 14State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

than one year without regularising them is arbitrary and unreasonable. This principle was also held
applicable to other categories of employees like daily wagers, casual labour and others, who were "workmen" as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act. The court further opined that inasmuch as the
State of Haryana was prescribing one year's service for regularisation (in its orders) the Punjab
Government cannot prescribe two years qualifying service. Thus, one year service was declared as
the norm for all such employees to become entitled to regularisation.

7. The directions ultimately granted by the High Court while allowing the batch of writ petitions are
to the following effect:

(1) The State Government should avoid making any ad hoc appointments. If they do so, it shall be
for initial period of six months and not be extended beyond other six months. If their term is
extended beyond one year, to such employees the benefits arising from our following conclusions
will apply, according to the group in which they fall. (2) The Punjab State employees covered by
Group No. 1 would be considered as regular members of the service on completion of more than one
year after ignoring national and permissible breaks in service, as noticed by the Supreme Court in
various judgments and also by our Full Banch in Jagdish Lal's case (supra). However, the concerned
departments would pass orders for their regularisation and they would be entitled to all benefits of
service from the date of their initial appointments.

As regards Haryana employees covered by Group No. 1 on completion of two years of service they
would be considered as regular members of service after ignoring their national and permissible
breaks as noticed by the Supreme Court in various judgments and also by our Full Bench in Jagdish
Lal's case (supra), and the concerned departments would pass orders for their regularisation. In case
of those, who have completed more than one year of service, their services shall not be terminated
till the new policy for regularisation in accordance with our judgment, is framed, in which a
direction has been issued to re-frame the policy for regularisation on completion of more than one
year of service, and without the condition which may hamper the policy of regularisation,
irrespective of the fact whether or not their names were sponsored by the Employment Exchange or
that their posts are within or outside the purview of the S.S.S.B. In case such petitioners complete
two years, then on completion of two years, they will be considered as regular members of service
and appropriate orders for their regularisation will be passed by the concerned departments, and
such employees would be entitled to all service benefits from the date of their initial appointments.

(3) The services of work charged, daily wage workers and casual labourers (other than those who fall
within the definition of workmen under the 1947 act covered by Group III) Serving in the different
departments of Government of Punjab and Haryana, as also their corporations who have put in
more than one year of service, would continue to serve and their services will not be dispensed with.
The concerned departments shall frame scheme for their absorption, as regular employees on
completion of more than one year of service, and their services shall be regularised under those
schemes. On regularisation they would be entitled to all service benefits from the date of initial
appointments.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 15State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

As regards work charged employees, who have completed five years of service, they shall be
considered to be regular employees under the scheme of regularisation framed by the State of
Punjab and order for their regularisation shall be passed. As regards work charged employees of the
State of Haryana, on completion of four years of service they shall be considered to be regular under
the regularisation scheme framed by the State and appropriate orders for their regularisation shall
be passed. However, they would be entitled to all service benefits from the date of initial
appointments.

(4) The persons falling in group (III) are those who come within the definition of *workmen' under
the 1947 Act. On completion of 240 days, which shall be counted keeping in view the decision of the
Supreme Court in The Workmen of American Express International Bank Corporation v. The
Management of American Express, A.I.R. 1986 S.C. 458, they would be entitled to benefits of all the
provisions of Chapter V-a of the 1947 Act, and their services should not be dispensed with without
following the procedure laid in that Chapter. For the purposes of regularisation, what has been
stated for the employees falling in Group II, would also be applicable to the employees falling in this
group. On regularisation they would be entitled to the benefits of provisions of the 1947 Act as also
the Service Rules, from the date of their initial appointments, as applicable to the departments
concerned from time to time.

(5) The ad hoc temporary employees in temporary organisations like the Adult Education Scheme
and Integrated Child Development Scheme, covered by Group IV, who have continued in service for
more than one year with national breaks would be entitled to the benefits of service and benefit of
the directions issued by the Supreme Court in Bhagwan Dass's case supra, and the service of none of
them would be terminated except on abandonment of the scheme.

(6) In case services of an employee, who come within the ambit of Groups I to III, have already been
terminated on the completion of his more than one year of service, he shall have to be taken back in
service in case of a request being made by him to the concerned department of the government
before the expiry of three years and two months of such termination.

Some of the petitioners, who had put in more than one year of service are out. They would be
reinstated forthwith with continuity of service and all benefits. (7) In case some posts are abolished
or some persons are found surplus, junior most would be out on the rule of Last come first go? But if
later on vacancies arise or posts are created, they will have to be called back first in the order of
seniority, that is, on the rule of last go first come and if still some vacancies remain, new incumbents
through S.S.S.B. may be accommodated. (8) The learned counsel for the State was asked to point out
if the claim made by the petitioners for equal pay for equal work as being paid to their counterparts,
in view of the decision taken by the Supreme Court in various cases, was not justified. He was not
able to point out if the claim so made was not correct. Accordingly, they would be paid wages as
claimed from the date of initial appointments in service. The arrears should be paid within six
months from today.

It is again made clear that till regularisation policies are framed as directed by us and regularisation
orders are passed, the employees shall continue and their services shall not be terminated."

8. The States of Punjab and Haryana are questioning the validity and correctness of the above
directions in these appeals. Some employees have also directly approached this court by way of writ
petitions contending that they too are governed by the directions given by the High Court and
should be given the benefit of the same. The respondents in these appeals and such writ petitioners
are supporting the judgment and directions aforesaid.

Mr. Sibal, learned counsel for the appellants questioned the validity and correctness of the
directions given by the High Court on the following grounds:

(1) That the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in virtually amending the Government orders
on the subject of regularisation. The learned Judges were not justified in holding that the fixation of
a particular date in the respective G.Os. was arbitrary and/or that it was un-related to the object.
The learned Judges have also erred in holding that the requirement of have been sponsored by the
employment Exchange was invalid.

(2) The learned Judges were not justified in law in directing that all persons who have put in one
year's service should be regularised unconditionally. No court has gone so far nor is there any
warrant for giving such a direction. Such a direction gives rise to several difficulties and
complications for the administration which were evidently not taken into consideration by the
learned Judges while giving the said directions. (3) For regularisation, the first pre-condition is that
there must be a vacancy, whether permanent or temporary. Such a vacancy must either be existing
or may be created but it must be there. There cannot be a direction for regularisation without a post
or a vacancy and the Government cannot be directed to create posts without number. It is beyond
the capacity of any Government in India to comply with such directions.

(4) The direction with respect to work-charge establishment is equally unsustainable in law. So is
the direction with respect to casual labour and daily wagers. (5) The learned Judges erred in
directing the Government of Punjab to reduce the minimum qualifying service to one year just
because the Haryana Government has been prescribing only one year's qualifying service in its
orders. Both are independent States and the rule in one State cannot be thrust upon the other.

(6) Because of the impugned directions, regularly selected persons are being kept out of jobs. The
effect of the impugned directions is that unqualified ineligible persons who have come through back
door and whose records of service may also not be satisfactory are all being regularised at one go.
The rule of reservation is also being violated by the said directions.

(7) It is prerogative of the Executive to create and abolish posts. The Government cannot be
compelled to create posts where there is no need for such posts or where the need is no longer there.

(8) The above contentions are supported and reiterated by the counsel appearing for the State of
Punjab.

g. On the other hand, it is contended by the counsel for the respondents and the counsel for the writ
petitioners that the directions given are perfectly warranted in all the circumstances of the case and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 17State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

have been given following the decisions of this court. It is submitted that the said directions have
been given with a view to curb the arbitrariness of the authorities and with a view to give a
satisfactory solution to a human problem created by the policies of the Governments themselves. It
is submitted by Shri R.K. Garg that the work-charged employees should be treated on par with ad
hoc employees and ought to be regularised on the 1st of April of each year. All those persons who are
working in the permanent posts ought to be regularised, says the counsel. Shri M.K.Ramamurthy,
appearing for the work charged employees contended that the general concept as to work charge
employees, viz., that the employment is confined to a particular work or project is not correct. He
submitted that this is a legacy left behind by the British. He submitted that the work charge
employees are employees of the work charge establishment and so long as once or the other work is
there, they should be continued. Inasmuch as the Government, particularly at the present stage of
development, is never without a project or work, these employees must also be regularised. Indeed,
according to the counsel the concept of work charge establishment is a mere matter of accountancy.
It is distinct from project employment. It is really temporary employment which in the nature of
things must be treated as regular. Other counsel appearing for the respondents in the appeals and
for the writ petitioners supported these contentions.

10. Ordinarily speaking, the creation and abolition of a post is the prerogative of the Executive. It is
the Executive again that lays down the conditions of service subject, of course, to a law made the
appropriate legislature. This power to prescribe the conditions service can be exercised either by
making Rules under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution or (in the absence of such Rules)
by issuing Rules/instructions in exercise of its executive power. The court comes into the picture
only to ensure observance of fundamental rights, statutory provisions, Rules and other instructions,
if any, governing the conditions of service. The main concern of the court in such matters is to
ensure the Rule of law and to see that the executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal to its employees
consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16. It also means that the State should not
exploit its employees nor should it seek to take advantage of the helplessness and misery of either
the unemployed persons or the employees, as the case may be. As is often said, the State must be a
model employer. It is for this reason, it is held that equal pay must be given for equal work, which is
indeed one of the directive principles of the Constitution. It is for this very reason it is held that a
person should not be kept in a temporary or ad hoc status for long. Where a temporary or ad hoc
appointment is continued for long the court presumes that there is need and warrant for a regular
post and accordingly directs regularisation. While all the situations in which the court may act to
ensure fairness cannot be detailed here, it is sufficient to indicate that the guiding principles are the
ones stated above. The principle relevant in this behalf are stated by this Court in several decisions,
of which it would be sufficient to mention two decisions having a bearing upon the issue involved
here. They are Dharwad Distt. P.W.D. Literature Daily Wage Employees Association v. State of
Karnataka and Ors. [1990] 2 S.C.C. 396 and Jacob v Kerala Water Authority alleged that about
50,000 persons were being employed on daily-rated or on monthly-rated basis over a period of 15 to
20 years, without regularising them. It was contended that the very fact that they are continued over
such a long period is itself proof of the fact that there is regular need for such employment. In that
view of the matter, following directions were given,after reviewing the earlier decisions of this court
elaborately.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 18State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

"From amongst the casual and daily rated employees who have completed ten years of service by
December 31, 1989, 18,600 shall immediately be regularised with effect from January 1, 1990 on the
basis of seniority-cum-suitability.

There shall be no examination but physical infirmity shall mainly be the test of suitability. The
remaining monthly rated employees covered by the paragraph 1 who have completed ten years of
service as on December 31, 1989 shall be regularised before December31,1990, in a phased manner
on the basis of seniority-cum-suitability, suitability being understood in the same way as above.

The balance of casual or daily rated employees who become entitled to absorption on the basis of
completing ten years of service shall be absorbed/regularised in a phased manner on the same
principle as above on or before December 31,1997.

At the point of regularisation, credit shall be given for every unit of five years of service in excess of
ten years and one additional increment in the time scale of pay shall be allowed by way of weightage.

There was a direction that the claims on other heads would be considered at the time of final
disposal. We have come to the conclusion that apart from these reliefs no other would be
admissible." Having given the said direction, the Bench (Ranganath Misra, M.M.Punchhi and
S.C.Agarwal, JJ.) made the following observations:

"We are alive to the position that the scheme which we have finalised is not the ideal one but as we
have already stated, it is the obligation of the court to individualise justice to suit a given situation in
a set of facts that are placed before it. Under the scheme of the constitution the purse remains in the
hands of the executive. The legislature of the State controls the Consolidated Fund out of which the
expenditure to be incurred, in giving effect to the scheme, will have to be met. The flow into the
Consolidated Fund depends upon the policy of taxation depending perhaps on the capacity of the
payer. Therefore, unduly burdening the State for implementing the constitutional obligation
forthwith would create problems which the State may not be able to stand. We have, Therefore,
made our directions with judicious restraint with the hope and trust that both parties would
appreciate and understand the situation. The instrumentality of the State must realise that it is
charged with a big trust. The money that flows into the Consolidated Fund and constitutes the
resources of the State comes from the people and the welfare expenditure that is mated out goes
from the same Fund back to the people. May be that in every situation the same tax payer is not
beneficiary. That is an incident of taxation and a necessary concomitant of living within a welfare
society."

11. The second case (Jacob) arose from Kerala. Upon the establishment of Kerala Water Authority
under Kerala Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1986, all the functions of Public Health Engineering
Department were also transferred to the Authority. All the employees of the said department were
transferred to the Authority. After its constitution, the Authority too recruited some persons. With
effect from 30.7.1988, the Authority came within the purview of the Public Service Commission. The
employees of the Authority thus fell into four categories namely, (i) those who were in the
employment of PHED before the constitution of the Authority and were transferred to the Authority,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 19State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

(ii) those whom the Authority employed between 1st April, 1984 and 4th August, 1986, (iii) those
who were appointed between 4th August 1986 and 30th July 1988, and (iv) those who were
appointed after 30th July, 1988. Rule 9 of the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules
empowered the Government to appoint persons, in the case of an emergency, otherwise than in
accordance with the Rules. Such appointment was to be valid only for a limited time and such
appointee was bound to be replaced by a regular appointee. At the same time, clause (e) of the Rule
provided that persons so appointed may be regularised provided they completed two years
continuous service on 22.12.1973. Construing the said clause in the light of the constitutional
philosophy, this court held:

"Therefore, if we interpret Rule 9(a) (i) consistently with the spirit and philsophy of the
Constitution, which it is permissible to do without doing violence to the said rule, it follows that
employees who are serving on the establishment for long spells and have the requisite qualifications
for the job, should not be thrown out but their services should be regularised as far as possible.
Since workers belonging to this batch have worked on their posts for reasonably long spells they are
entitled to regularisation in service." In the light of the said principle and in the light of the
principles emerging from the decisions of this court - which were elaborately discussed-the
following directions were given:

"(1) The Authority will with immediate effect regularise the services of all ex-PHED employees as
per its Resolution of 30th January, 1987 without waiting for State Government approval. (2) The
services of workers employed by the Authority between ist April, 1984 and 4th August, 1986 will be
regularised with immediate effect if they possess the requisite qualifications for the post prescribed
on the date of appointment of the con
cerned worker.

(3) The services of workers appointed after 4th August, 1984 and possessing the requisite
qualifications should be regulated in accordance with Act 19 of 1970 provided they have put in
continuous service of not less than one year, artificial breaks, if any, to be ignored. The Kerala Public
Service Commission will take immediate steps to regularise their services as a separate block. In
doing so the Kerala Public Service Commission will take the age bar as waived. (4) The Kerala Public
Service Commission will consider the question of regularisation of the services of workers who
possess the requisite qualifications but have put in less than one year's service, separately. In doing
so the Kerala Public Service commission will take the age bar as waived. If they are found fit they
will be placed on the list along with the newly recruited candidates in the order of their respective
merits. The Kerala Public Service commission will be free to rearrange the list accordingly.
Thereafter fresh appointments will issue depending on the total number of posts available. If the
posts are inadequate, those presently in employment will make room for the selected candidates but
their names will remain on the list and they will be entitled to appointment as and when their turn
arrives in regular course. The list will enure for such period as is permissible under the extant rules.

(5) The Authority will be at liberty to deal with the services of the workers who do not possess the
requisite qualifications as it may consider appropriate in accordance with law.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 20State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

(6) Those workers whose services have been terminated in violation of this Court's order in respect
of which Contempt Petition No. 156 of 1990 is taken out shall be entitled to the benefit of this order
as if they continue in service and the case of each worker will be governed by the clause applicable to
him depending on the category to which he belongs and if he is found eligible for regularisation he
will be restored to service and assigned his proper place."

12. As would be evident from the observations made and directions given in the above two cases, the
court must, while giving such directions, act with due care and caution. It must first ascertain the
relevant facts, and must be cognizant of the several situations and eventualities that may arise on
account of such directions. A practical and pragmatic view has to be taken, inasmuch as every such
direction not only tells upon the public exchequer but also has the effect of increasing the cadre
strength of a particular service, class or category. Now, take the directions given in the judgment
under appeal. Apart from the fact the High Court was not right-as we shall presently demonstrate in
holding that the several conditions imposed by the two Governments in their respective order
relating to regularisation are arbitrary not valid and justified - the high Court acted rather hastily in
directing wholesome regularisation of all such persons who have put in one year's service, and that
too unconditionally. We may venture to point out the several problems that will arise if such
directions become the norm:

(a) Take a case where certain vacancies are existing or expected and steps are taken for regular
recruitment either through Public Service Commission or other such body, as the case may be. A
large number of persons apply. Inevitably there is bound to be some delay in finalising the selections
and making the appointments. Very often the process of selection is stayed or has to be re-done for
one or the other reason. Meanwhile the exigencies of administration may require appointment of
temporary hands. It may happen that these temporary hands are continued for more than one year
because the regular selection has not yet been finalised. Now according to the impugned direction
the temporary hands completing one year's service will have to be regularised in those posts which
means frustating the - regular selection. There would be no post left for regularly selected persons
even if they are selected. Such cases have indeed come to this court from these very two States.

(b) In some situations, the permanent incumbent of a post may be absent for more than a year.
Examples of this are not wanting. He may go on deputation, he may go on Faculty Improvement
Programme (F.I.P.), or he may be suspended pending enquiry into charges against him and so on.
There may be any number of such situations. If a person is appointed temporarily in his place and
after one year he is made permanent where will the permanent incumbent be placed on his return?
Two persons cannot hold the same post on a regular or permanent basis.

(c) It may also happen that for a particular post a qualified person is not available at a given point of
time. Pending another attempt at selection later on an unqualified person is appointed temporarily.
He may continue for more than one year. If he is to be regularised, it would not only mean
foreclosing of appointment of a regular qualified person, it would also mean appointment of an
unqualified person.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 21State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

(d) Such directions have also the effect of disregarding and violating the rule relating to reservation
in favour of backward class of citizens made under Article 16(4). What cannot be done directly
cannot be allowed to be done in such indirect manner.

(e) Many appointments may have been made irregularly - as in this case - in the sense that the
candidates were neither sponsored by the Employment Exchange nor were they appointed after
issuing a proper advertisement calling for applications. In short, it may be a back door entry. A
direction to regularise such appointments would only result in encouragement to such unhealthy
practices.

These are but a few problems that may arise, if such directions become the norm. There may be
many such and other problems that may arise. All this only emphasises the need for a fuller
consideration and due circumspection while giving such directions.

13 . Now we shall proceed to examine whether the High Court was right in holding that the several
conditions prescribed in the orders issued by the two Governments from time to time are bad. In
particular, whether the High Court was right in holding that prescribing a particular date by which
the prescribed period of service should have been put in and the further condition that the candidate
must have been sponsored by Employment Exchange, are arbitrary and unreasonable. These G.Os.
were issued by the Government from time to time. These orders are not in the nature of a statute
which is applicable to all existing and future situations. They were issued to meet a given situation
facing the Government at a given point of time. In the circumstances therefore, there was nothing
wrong in prescribing a particular date by which the specified period of service (whether it is one year
or two years) ought to have been put in. Take for example, the orders issued by the Haryana
Government. The first order is dated ist January, 1980. It says, a person must have completed two
years of service as on 31st December, 1979, i.e., the day previous to the issuance of the order. How
could it be said that fixing of such a date is arbitrary and unreasonable? Similarly the order dated
3rd January, 1983 fixes 15th September, 1982 as the relevant date. This notification/order does two
things. Firstly, it excludes class III posts of clerks from the purview of the S.S.S.B. in case of those
who have completed a minimum of two years of service as on 15th September, 1982, and secondly, it
provides for their regularisation subject to certain conditions. No particular attack was made as to
this date in the High Court. Consequently the Government of Haryana had no opportunity of
explaining as to why this particular date was fixed. Without giving such an opportunity, it cannot be
held that the fixation of the said date is arbitrary. What is more relevant is that the High Court has
not held that this particular date is arbitrary. According to it, fixation of any date whatsoever is
arbitrary, because in its opinion the order must say that any and every person who completes the
prescribed period of service must be regularised on completion of such period of service. The next
order dated 24th March, 1987 prescribes the date as 31.12.1986 i.e., the end of the previous year. In
the circumstances, we see no basis for holding that fixation of the date can be held to be arbitrary in
the facts and circumstances of the case. In this connection, reference may be made to the decision of
this court in Dr. Sushma Sharma v. State of Rajasthan, (1985) S.C. 367. The Governor of Rajasthan
had issued an ordinance stating that "all temporary lectures as were appointed as such on or before
the 25th day of June 1975 and are continuing as such at the commencement of the Rajasthan
Universities Teachers (Absorption of Temporary Lecturers) Ordinance, 1978 (Ordinance No. 5 of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 22State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

1978) shall be considered by the University concerned for their absorption and substantive
appointment on the recommendation of the Screening Committee constituted under section 4
subject to their fulfilling the conditions of eligibility including minimum qualifications prescribed by
the University concerned under the relevant law as applicable on the respective dates of their
temporary appointments and subject also the availability of substantive vacancies of lecturers in the
department concerned."

The validity of the said ordinance was questioned on the ground that the fixation of the date, 25th
day of June, 1975, was arbitrary and has been chosen only because that was the date on which
internal emergency was proclaimed. It was also submitted that the further requirement that the
lecturer appointed should be continuing as such on the date of commencement of the ordinance
(12.6.1978) is an equally arbitrary and unreasonable condition. Both these contentions were rejected
by this court. The court negatived the contention that the prescription of the said date and the
further requirement of being in service on the date of ordinance have the effect of excluding persons
who have put in long years of service but were not continuing on the date of ordinance, making the
said conditions discriminatory. Such possibilities, it was held, were not enough to castigate the said
condition as aribitrary. It was observed that there was no evidence to show any attempt on the part
of the Government to separate or penalise pre-emergency appointees or for that matter any
particular class of oppointees. In this context, we must remember that what is in issue is not the
wisdom of the executive in issuing a particular order or orders but the validity thereof. The court
may think it more desirable that the order should be in particular terms as indicated by it, but that is
not enough.

14. The next question is whether the orders issued by the two Government were arbitrary and
unreasonable in so far as they prescribed that only those employees who had been sponsored by
Employment Exchange should alone be regularised. In our opinion, this was a reasonable and
wholesome requirement designed to curb and discourage back door entry and irregular
appointments. The Government orders say that all those who have been sponsored by Employment
Exchange or have been appointed after issuing a public advertisement alone should be regularised.
We see no unreasonableness or invalidity in the same. As stated above, it is a wholesome provision
and ought not to have been invalidated. Moreover, as pointed out hereinbefore, it is not found by the
High Court that the writ petitioners were appointed only after obtaining a non-availability certificate
from the Employment Exchange. The decision relied upon by the High Court does not say that even
without such a certificate from Employment Exchange, an appointment can be made or that such
appointment should be consistent with the mandate of Articles 14 and 16.

We must also say that the further requirement prescribed in the orders viz., that the employees must
have possessed the prescribed qualifications for the post at the time of his appointment on ad hoc
basis is equally a valid condition. Indeed, no exception is taken to it by the High Court.

15. We may now consider whether the High Court was justified in holding that inasmuch as Haryana
and Punjab are sister States and because prior to 1966 Haryana was a part of Punjab, the rule
relating to length of service requisite for regularisation should be uniform in both the states. We see
absolutely no basis for the said holding. They are two different States having their own

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 23State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

Governments, merely because one Government chooses to say that one year's temporary or ad hoc
service is enough for regularisation it cannot be said that the other state must also prescribe the very
same period or that it cannot prescribe a longer or shorter period. The fact that there is a single High
Court for both the States and the Union Territory of Chandigarh is no ground for saying that the
orders issued by them should be uniform.

16. The learned Judges have further directed that in so far as the State of Haryana is concerned class
III and IV posts which were within the purview of the S.S.S.B. shall equally be within the purview of
regularisation orders issued by it. The learned Judges have pointed out that for a period of 10 years
there was no such Board functioning and further that from the year 1970 to 1987 "most of the class
III and IV posts with which we are concerned were kept out of the purview of the S.S.S.B. "The
correctness of the said factual statement is not questioned before us. It is therefore, not necessary to
alter or modify the direction made by the High Court on this aspect. In fact, no arguments were
addressed to us with respect to the said direction made by the High Court. If any of the petitioners
have been excluded from consideration (for regularisation) on the basis of the above condition, they
may be considered and appropriate orders passed.

17. Now coming to the direction that all those adhoc/temporary employees who have continued for
more than an year should be regularised, we find it difficult to sustain it. The direction has been
given without reference to the existence of a vacancy. The direction in effect means that every
adhoc/temporary employee who has been continued for one year should be regularised even though
(a) no vacancy is available for him- which means creation of a vacancy (b) he was not sponsored by
the Employment Exchange nor was he appointed in pursuance of a notification calling for
applications - which means he had entered by a back-door

(c) he was not eligible and/or qualified for the post at the time of his appointment (d) his record of
service since his appointment is not satisfactory. These are in addition to some of the problems
indicated by us in pare 12, which would arise from giving of such blanket orders. None of the
decisions relied upon by the High Court justify such whole-sale , Unconditional orders. Moreover,
from the mere continuation of an adhoc employee for one year, it cannot be presumed that there is
need for a regular post. Such a presumption may be justified only when such continuance extends to
several years. Further, there can be no 'rule of thumb' in such matters. Conditions and
circumstances of one unity may not be the same as of the other. Just because in one case, a direction
was given to regularise employees who have put in one year's service as far as possible and subject to
fulfilling the qualifications, it cannot be held that in each and every case such a direction must follow
irrespective of and without taking into account the other relevant circumstances and considerations.
The relief must be moulded in each case having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances of
that case. It cannot be a mechanical act but a judicious one. Judged from this stand point, the
impugned directions must be held to be totally untenable and unsustainable.

18. So far as the members of the work-charged establishment are concerned, the nature of their

employment is already pronounced upon by this court in Jaswant Singh v. Union of india, [1980] 1
S.C.R.426 It is stated therein:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 24State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

"A work-charged establishment broadly means an establishment of which the expensed, including
the wages and allowances of the staff, are chargeable to "works". The pay and allowances of
employees who are borne on a work-charged establishment are generally shown as a separate
sub-head of the estimated cost of the work.

The entire strength of labour employed for the purpose of the Beas Project was work-charged. The
work-charged employees are engaged on a temporary basis and their appointments are made for the
executive of a specific work. From the very nature of their employment, their services automatically
come to an end on end on the completion of the works for the sole purpose of which they are
employed. They do not get any relief under the Payment of Gratuity Act nor do they receive any
retrenchment benefits or any benefits under the Employees State Insurance Schemes.

But though the work-charged employees are denied these benefits, they are industrial workers and
are entitled to the benefits of the provisions contained in the Industrial Disputes Act. Their rights
flow from that special enactment under which even contracts of employment are open to adjustment
and modification. The work-charged employees, therefore, are in a better position than temporary
servants like the other petitioners who are liable to be thrown out of employment without any kind
of compensatory benefits."

Be that as it may, so far as the State of Haryana is concerned, this contention has become of
academic interest in view of the orders issued on 24th March, 1987 and 6th April 1990, which we
shall presently notice. In view of the said orders, the direction given by the High Court becomed
unneccesary. Though the State of Punjab has not issued any such orders, it appears from the the
affidavit filed on its behalf(sworn to by Sri P.C.Sangar, Deputy Secretary to the Government,
Department of Personnel dated 19.3.1991) that a scheme of regularisation of these employees has
been prepared in pursuance of the impugned judgement. The said scheme is, however, not made
conditional upon the result of these appeals against the judgment. On a perusal of the scheme, we
find it to be a reasonably fair scheme. We hope and trust that irrespective of the result of these
appeals, the said scheme shall be given effect to by the State of Punjab.

19. The High Court has also directed that all those employees who fall within the definition of
"workmen" contained in the Industrial Disputes Act will also be entitled to regularisation on par
with the work-charged employees in whose case it is directed that they should be regularised on
completing five years of service in Punjab and four years of service in Haryana. This direction is
given in favour of those casual labour and daily wagers who fall within the definition of workmen. In
so far as work- charged employees, daily wage workers and casual labourers who do not fall within
the definition of workmen are concerned, the High Court had directed their regularisation on
completion of one year's service. We find this direction as untenable as the direction in the case of
adhoc/temporary employees. In so far as the persons belonging to the above categories and who fall
within the definition of Workmen are concerned, the terms in which the direction has been given by
the High Court cannot be sustained. While we agree that persons belonging to these categories
continuing over a number of years have a right to claim regularisation and the authorities are under
an obligation to consider their case for regularisation in a fair manner, keeping in view the
principles enunciated by this court, the blanket direction given cannot be sustained. We need not,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 25State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

however, pursue this discussion in view of the orders of the Government of Haryana contained in
the letter dated 6.4.1990 which provide for regularisation of these persons on completion of ten
years. We shall presently notice the contents of the said letter. In view of the same, no further
directions are called for at this stage. The Government of Punjab, of course, does not appear to have
issued any such orders governing these categories. Accordingly, there shall be a direction to the
Government of Punjab to verify the vacancy position in the categories of daily wagers and casual
labour and frame a scheme of absorption in a fair and just manner providing for regularisation of
these persons, having regard to their length of service and other relevant conditions. As many
persons as possible shall be absorbed. The scheme shall be framed within six months from today.

20. So far as temporary or time-bound schemes are concerned, the matter is exhaustively dealt with
and pronounced upon in Delhi Development Horticulture Employees Union v. Delhi
Administration, (1992) 1 J.T. 394. We need not add to it. In any event, the direction given by the
High Court with respect to this category has not been assailed before us.

21. We may also point out that after the filing of the writ petitions and during the pendency of the
Special Leave Petitions in this court, the Government of Haryana has issued certain further orders
to which reference may now be made.

(i) On 24th March 1987 the Chief Secretary to the Government of Haryana wrote to all the Heads of
Departments and others stating the following : "the matter relating to the regularisations of the
work charged employees was engaging attention of the Government for some time past. After
careful consideration it has now been decided that the services of all the work charge employees
working in the Haryana State who have completed four years or more continuous service on
31.12.1986 should be regularised". All the authorities were directed to take immediate appropriate
action in that behalf. (We have no reason to believe that the said orders will not be given effect to in
full).

(ii) On 5th February, 1990 the Chief Secretary to the Government of Haryana wrote to all the Heads
of Departments and others apprising them of the new policy and procedure evolved by the
Government in the matter of making adhoc appointments. The letter says that no adhoc
appointment shall be made in future on any posts unless a proper requisition has been sent to
Haryana Public Service Commission/Subordinate Services Selection Board. It says further that if
any adhoc appointment is required to be made it shall be made only through Employment Exchange
or by advertising such post in a daily newspaper after obtaining a N.A.C. certificate from the
Employment Exchange. Such appointment even if made shall not last beyond nine months and will
be subject to a regular appointment being made by H.P.S.C./S.S.S.B.

(iii) In pursuance of the interim orders passed by this court in this batch (recording the undertaking
given by the counsel for the State of Haryana to frame a scheme for absorption) the Government of
Haryana did frame of such a scheme contained in the Chief Secretary's letter dated 6.4.1990
addressed to all the Heads of Department. It covers the ad hoc employees, work charged employees,
casual workers/daily rated employees, workmen, ad hoc/temporary employees in temporary
organisation as also seasonal workers. It is but appropriate that we set out the said letter in full:

Sir, I am directed to refer to the subject noted above and to state that the matter regarding laying
down the policy with regard to regularisation of the services of Class-III ad hoc employees, workcharged/daily wagers etc. has been under consideration of Govt. for some time past. After careful
consideration, it has been decided that the Regularisation of these employees shall be on the
following terms and conditions:

disciplinary proceedings are pending against them.

(iii)The employees posses the prescribed qualifications for the post at the time of their appointment
on adhoc basis.

the employees belonging to general category have been appointed against reserved category
posts/vacancies the services of such adhoc appointees shall not be regularises and their services
shall be terminated in case, no general category vacancy/post(s) is available on 30.9.88.

(v) The recommendees of the SSS board shall be absorbed against the remaining vacancies, if any.
The names of such remaining reeommendees as cannot be absorbed shall be returned to the Board
to enable it to recommend their names to other departments for appointments against the clear
vacancies.

(vi) After regularisation of adhoc employees under the policy, if some posts/vacancies still remain
unfilled, these shall be filled in from the reeommendees of the SSS Board, if any. If some shortfall
remains even after than, the procedure laid down in the insts. issued vide No.50/35/88- 5GSI, dated
5.2.90 shall be followed, for making up the shortfall, it felt necessary.

entitled to an annual increment of Rs. 12 till their services are regularized. On Regularisation, they
shall be put in the time scale of pay applicable to the lowest Group 'D' in the Govt. and they would be

(iv) On 28th February, 1991, yet another order has been issued by the Governor of Haryana under
the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution providing for regularisation of class III employees who
have put in service of two years on 31st December, 1990 subject to usual conditions. This order
reads as follows:

"Notification The 28th February, 1991 No. G.S.R. 11/Const./Art.309/91.- In exercise of the powers
conferred by the proviso to article 309 of the Constitution of India read with the proviso to clause 6
of Haryana Government, General Administration Department (General Services), notification
No.523-3 GSI-70/2068, dated the 28th January, 1970 the Governor of Haryana hereby specifies
such Class III posts as have been held for a minimum period of two years on the 31st December,
1990, by Class III employees on ad hoc basis to be taken out of the perview of the Subordinate
Services Selection Board, Haryana and their services shall be regularised if they fulfill the following
conditions, namely:
(i) that the employees have completed two years services on 31st December, 1990, and were in
service on 31st December, 1990.

(ii) that the employees shall be regularised against the posts/vacancies of relevant categories. The
employees of general category may be regularised in excess of their quota with the clear stipulation
that in future recruitments only the candidates from reserve categories will be appointed until the
back log arising out of utilisation of reserve category vacancies by general category ad hoc employees
is cleared:

(iii) that the employees should have been recruited through the Employment Exchange or directly
appointed by the appointing authority after obtaining the non-availabilty certificate from the

Employment Exchange;

disciplinary proceedings are pending against them, and

the same, the direct recruit shall be senior.

KULWANT SINGH chief Secretary to Government Haryana "

22. So far as the Punjab Government is concerned, an affidavit sworn to by Sri G.K.Bansal, Under
Secretary to the Government, Department of Personnel, Government of Punjab has been filed before
us stating that the instructions issued by the Haryana Government for regularisation of the services
of class III ad hoc employees contained in their notification dated 28.2.1991 shall be adopted by the
Punjab Government mutatis mutandis. The relevant portion of the affidavit may be extracted herein
below: "The policy instructions for the regularisation of services of Class-III adhoc employees issued
by Haryana Government vide their notification dated 28/2/91 mutatis mutandis will be adopted as
under:
(i) That the adhoc/temporarily appointed employees should have completed a minimum of two
years service on 31/12/90 and was in service on 31/12/90. While calculating the period of service,
any break of notional nature not exceeding 30 days falling between adhoc/temporarily
appointments in the same category of post (s) and in the same Department is to be ignored.
However, the break in adhoc/temporary service would be ignored in cases where:

(a) The employee concerned left service of his own volition either to join some other Department or
for some other reasons, or

(b) the adhoc/temporary appointment was against a post/vacancy for which no regular recruitment
was intended/required to be made e.g. leave arrangements for filling of other short-term vacancies.

(ii) that they fulfill the conditions of eligibility as prescribed (i.e. they have been recruited through
the Employment Exchange or by open advertisement) academic qualifications, experience and the
condition of age at the time of their first/adhoc/temporary appointment in accordance with the
Departmental service rules and instructions issued by the government.

(iii) that their record of service is satisfactory.

(iv) that they have been found medically fit for entry into Government service and that their

character and antecedents have also been duly verified and found suitable for Government service;

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 30State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

(v) that a regular post/vacancy is available for regularisation;

(vi) that they have been found fit for regularisation by the Departmental Selection Committees
constituted in accordance with the instructions contained in Government circular letter
No.12/30/86/IGE/5139 dated 15/4/86;

(vii) The seniority of the adhoc/temporarily appointed class-III employees so regularized vis-a- vis
class-III employees appointed on regular basis shall be determined w.e.f. 31.12.90. The inter-se
seniority of such adhoc/temporarily appointed class-III employees shall be determined in
accordance with the date of their joining the post on adhoc/temporary basis. If the date of joining
the post(s) on adhoc/temporary basis by such adhoc/temporarily appointed employees was the
same then an older employee shall rank senior to an employee younger in age. If the date of joining
of the direct recruit and the date of regularisation of adhoc-temporarily appointed employee is the
same, the direct recruit shall be senior;

The cases of such adhoc/temporarily appointed employees who have already completed three years
service on 31st December, 90 and have satisfactory record of service but who do not fulfill the
prescribed conditions with regard to qualifications, age or mode of their initial recruitment will also
be considered for regularisation in relaxation of these conditions if the Departmental Service Rules
applicable to these employees provide for relaxation of these conditions of recruitment."

We are sure that many of the employees would get regularised under the orders aforementioned
issued by both the Governments.

23. This is not a case, we must reiterate, where the Governments have failed to take any steps for
regularisation of their adhoc employees working over the years. Every few years they have been
issuing orders providing for regularisation. In such a case, there is no occasion for the court to issue
any directions for regularising such employees more particularly when none of the conditions
prescribed in the said orders can be said to be either unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. The
court cannot obviously help those who cannot get regularised under these orders for their failure to
satisfy the conditions prescribed therein. Issuing general declaration of indulgence is no part of our
jurisdiction. In case of such persons we can only observe that it is for the respective Governments to
consider the feasibility of giving them appropriate relief, particularly in cases where persons have
been continuing over a long number of years, and were eligible and qualified on the date of their
adhoc appointment and further whose record of service is satisfactory.

24. With respect to direction No. 8 (equal pay for equal work) we find the judgment singularly
devoid of any discussion. The direction given is totally vague. It does not make it clear who will get
what pay and on what basis. The said direction is liable to be set aside on this account and is,
accordingly, set aside.

In the matters posted before and heard by us, there are several S.L.Ps. preferred against orders of
the High Court allowing writ petitions following the judgment in Piara Singh. Leave is granted in all

such matters as well and the appeals allowed in the same terms as the appeals against the judgement

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 31State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

in Piara Singh.

25. Before parting with this case, we think it appropriate to say a few words concerning the issue of
regularisation of adhoc/temporary employees in government service.

The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment through the prescribed agency but exigencies of
administration may sometimes call for an adhoc or temporary appointment to be made. In such a
situation, effort should always be to replace such an adhoc/temporary employee by a regularly
selected employee as early as possible. Such a temporary employee may also compete along with
others for such regular selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and good, but if he does not,
he must give way to the regularly selected candidate. The appointment of the regularly selected
candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance for the sake of such an adhoc/temporary
employee.

Secondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by another adhoc or temporary
employee; he must be replaced only by a regularly selected employee. This is necessary to avoid
arbitrary action on the part of the appointing authority.

Thirdly, even where an adhoc or temporary employment is necessitated on account of the exigencies
of administration, he should ordinarily be drawn from the employment exchange unless it cannot
brook delay in which case the pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no candidate is available
or is not sponsored by the employment exchange, some appropriate method consistent with the
requirements of Article 16 should be followed. In other words, there must be a notice published in
the appropriate manner calling for applications and all those who apply in response thereto should
be considered fairly.

An unqualified person ought to be appointed only when qualified persons are not available through
the above processes.

If for any reason, an adhoc or temporary employee is continued for a fairly long spell, the authorities
must consider his case for regularisation provided he is eligible and qualified according to rules and
his service record is satisfactory and his appointment does not run counter to the reservation policy
of the State.

The proper course would be that each States prepares a scheme, if one is not already in vogue, for
regularisation of such employees consistent with its reservation policy and if a scheme is already
framed, the same way be made consistent with our observations herein so as to reduce avoidable
litigation in this behalf. If and when such person is regularised he should be placed immediately
below the last regularly appointed employee in that category, class or service, as the case may be.

So far as the work-charged employees and casual labour are concerned, the effort must be to
regularise them as far as possible and as early as possible subject to their fulfilling the qualifications,
if any, prescribed for the post and subject also to availability of work. If a casual labourer is
continued for a fairly long spell - say two or three years - a presumption may arise that there is

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/499423/ 32State Of Haryana And Ors. Etc. Etc vs Piara Singh And Ors. Etc. Etc on 12 August, 1992

regular need for his services. In such a situation, it becomes obligatory for the concerned authority
to examine the feasibility of his regularisation. While doing so, the authorities ought to adopt a
positive approach coupled with an empathy for the person. As has been repeatedly stressed by this
court, security of tenure is necessary for an employee to give his best to the job. In this behalf, we do
commend the orders of the Government of Haryana (contained in its letter dated 6.4.90 referred to
hereinbefore) both in relation to work-charged employees as well as casual labour.

We must also say that the orders issued by the Governments of Punjab and Haryana providing for
regularisation of adhoc/temporary employees who have put in two years/one year of service are
quite generous and leave no room for any legitimate grievance by any one.

These are but a few observations which we thought it necessary to make, impelled by the facts of this
case, and the spate of litigation by such employees. They are not exhaustive nor can they be
understood as immutable. Each Government or authority has to devise its own criteria or principles
for regularisation having regard to all the relevant circumstances, but while doing so, it should bear
in mind the observations made herein.

26. So far as the employees and workmen employed by Statutory/Public Corporations are
concerned, it may be noted that they have not issued any orders akin to those issued by the Punjab
and Haryana Government. Even so, it is but appropriate that they adopt as far as possible, keeping
the exigencies and requirements of their administration in view, the criteria and principles
underlying the orders issued by their Government in the matter of regularisation and pass
appropriate orders. In short, the Statutory/Public Corporations in Haryana will follow the orders
contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990 referred to above, as supplemented by the orders in the
Notification dated 28.2.1991, where as the Statutory/Public Corporations in Punjab shall follow the
criteria and principles stated in the affidavit of Sri G.K.Bansal, Under Secretary to the Government
of Punjab, Department of Personnel referred to in para 22 above. These directions shall not,
however, apply to these Statutory/Public Corporations functioning within these States as are under
the control of the Government of India. These Corporations will do well to evolve an appropriate
policy of regularisation, in the light of this judgment, if they have not already evolved one, or make
their existing policy consistent with this judgment to avoid litigation.

27. For the above reasons, all the appeals are allowed and the orders under appeal are set aside. The
directions given by the High Court in the judgment in W.P.(C) No.72/88 namely direction Nos.
1,2,3,4,6 and 8 are set aside. The only direction given herewith is the one contained in para

19. The writ petitions seeking the benefits given in the judgment under appeal are dismissed.

No costs.

HEADNOTE:

Section 3 of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973 provides for declaration of an area to be a
‘development area' by gazette notification. Section 14(1) of
the Act interdicts development of land in such an area by
any person or body unless permission has been obtained from
the Vice-Chairman of the Development Authority. Section
15(1) requires every person or body desirous of obtaining
permission to make an application in the manner prescribed.
Section 15(3) empowers the Vice-Chairman, after making such
an enquiry as he considers necessary, either to grant the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

permission subject to such conditions as he may specify, or
refuse the permission. Section 15(5) provides for an appeal
to the Chairman against an order made by the Vice-Chairman
refusing permission. Section 37 inter alia makes an order of
the Vice-Chairman made under s. 15 final. Section 41(1)
makes it incumbent on the Authority (the Chairman or the
Vice-Chairman) to carry out such directions as may be issued
to it from time to time by the State Government for the
efficient administration of the Act. Section 41 (3) confers
revisional powers on the State Government.

The respondent-lessees applied to the appellant-Development Authority under s. 15(1) of the Act for permission to
put up a multistoreyed building on the demised plot. The
Vice-Chairman of the Authority sanctioned the permission by
his order dated January 31,

LAT

1985. However, on July 24, 1985 the State Government issued
directions purporting to be under s. 41(1) of the Act interdicting the progress of construction on ground of violation
of the conditions of the lease. The High Court allowed the
writ petition preferred by the respondents and quashed the
said directions.

Thereafter, on August 12, 1985 the State Government
brought to the notice of the Vice-Chairman serious illegalities in the building sanction and indicated that the same he
reviewed and revoked, to which he did not agree. Finally, by
its communication dated October 15, 1985 addressed to the
Chairman of the Authority the State Government directed him
to initiate immediate proceedings against the respondents
for making misrepresentations, fraudulent statements and
concealing material facts in obtaining building permission.
To that letter was annexed a notice for service on the
lessees and the builder associated with construction to show
cause for cancellation of the lease and demolition of unauthorised construction. The respondents filed their objections against the proposed cancellation, but the Government
by its order dated November 19, 1985 found the explanation
unacceptable and proceeded to terminate the lease. This
order was challenged by the respondent-lessees in a writ
petition before the High Court.

Subsequently, the Vice-Chairman of the Authority in a
separate action issued notice dated January 9, 1986 to the
respondents to show cause why the building permission granted on January 31, 1985 should not be cancelled. Respondents
objected to the proposed action but the Authority found the
objections unacceptable and proceeded by its order dated
April 19, 1986 to cancel the permission. The two lessees
challenged this cancellation in writ petitions before the
High Court.

The High Court found that the proceedings initiated and
the action taken by the Government and the Vice-Chairman of
the Authority in the matter, respectively, of forfeiture of
the lease and the cancellation of the permission to build

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

were both infirm in law and required to he quashed. It took
the view that a reasonable opportunity of being heard had
been denied to the lessee-respondents, and that the grounds
for forfeiture of the lease were irrelevant and illusory;
that there was no provision in the Development Act  conferring powers on the ViceChairman to review the decision in
the matter of sanctioning a plan to build after the same was
acted upon and constructions were being made only in accordance with it; that s. 41(1) of the Act could authorise the
Vice-Chairman to review the earlier permission but that
there being no such directive from the Government the ViceChairman acting as a

178

statutory authority had no power to revoke or cancel the
permission once granted, and that there was no casual connection between the Government's directive dated October IS,
1985, which had confined itself to the cancellation of the
lease, and the proceedings initiated by the Vice-Chairman on
January 9, 1986. It further found that as personal hearing
has not been given to the petitioners the order passed by
the Vice-Chairman violates the principles of natural justice
and that the grounds alleged were not sufficient to sustain
the cancellation of the permission.

In the appeals by special leave preferred by the State
Government in the matter of forfeiture of lease, it was
contended for the appellants that the High Court fell into
an error in allowing a matter, which should properly have
been the subject matter of a civil suit, to be agitated in
proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. The
submission was that the question whether there were breaches
of covenants on the part of the lessees involved the construction of the terms of the lease deed which required
evidence on the matter and such a dispute could not be
resolved on mere affidavits, and that the relationship
between the parties being one of lessor and lessee the
dispute between them pertained to a private law situation.
It was also submitted that no hearing could be contemplated
in the context for forfeiture of a lease of this nature. For
the respondents it was contended that the State, even as a
lessor, could not act arbitrarily either in the grant or
premature termination of the leases of public property and
disputes arising in such context cannot always be reckoned
as private law situations, and that at all events, the
threatened exercise of extra-judicial re-entry by the State,
being violative both of the limitations of the powers of the
State as lessor under the law of landlord and tenant and or
its actions as State, was a matter which required to be
Mandated against.

In the appeals by special leave by the Development
Authority in the matter or cancellation of permission to
build, it was contended for it that the order dated April
19, 1986 itself disclosed the extent or opportunities afforded to the lessees and there could, therefore, be no

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

question of failure or natural justice, that if permission
had been obtained by the lessees by misrepresentation or
fraud or, if after obtaining the permission there had been
violation of the terms and conditions or the grant, as in
the instant case, the statutory authority granting the
permission has itself the inherent and incidental and supplemental powers to revoke the permission, and that no
express grant of power in this behalf was necessary. For the
respondents it was contended that the proceedings for cancellation of the permission having been initiated at

179

the instance of and compelled by the directions issued by
the Government purporting to act under s. 41(1) of the Act
there was a surrender of statutory discretion on the part of
the Vice-Chairman thereby vitiating the decision; that the
Vice-Chairman had no authority in law to cancel the permission, that the power to cancel or revoke a licence or permission, even assuming that the statute enables such cancellation, was clearly distinguishable from the power of
refusal of an initial grant and that the exercise of power
of cancellation which prejudicially affects vested fights
partakes predominantly of quasi-judicial complexion; and
that as there was denial of a reasonable opportunity of
being heard the order passed by the Vice-Chairman violates
the principles of natural justice.

Allowing appeals by the State,

HELD: 1. The question whether the purported forfeiture
and cancellation of the lease were valid or not should not
have been allowed by the High Court to he agitated under
Article 226 of the Constitution since it involved resolution
of disputes on questions of fact as well. [191C]

Express Newspapers v. Union of India, [1985] Suppl. 3
SCR 382, referred to.

2. A lessor, with the best of title, has no right to
resume possession extra-judicially by use of force, from a
lessee, even after the expiry or earlier termination of the
lease by forfeiture or otherwise. The use of the expression
‘re-entry' in the lease-deed does not authorise extrajudicial methods to resume possession. Under law the possession
of a lessee, even after the expiry or its earlier termination is judicial possession and forcible dispossession is
prohibited. He cannot, therefore, be dispossessed otherwise
than in due course of law. [191F-G]

In the instant case, the fact that the lessor is the
State does not place it in any higher or better position. On
the contrary, it is under an additional inhibition stemming
from the requirement that all actions of Government and
governmental authorities should have a ‘legal pedigree'. The
State Government is, accordingly, prohibited from taking
possession otherwise than in accordance with law. [192C]
Bishandas v. State of Punjab, [1962] 2 SCR 69, referred to.
The question of the legality and validity of the purported
cancella
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

180

tion of the lease and the defence of the lessees is left
open to be urged in appropriate legal proceedings, whenever
and wherever Government proceeds to initiate action in
accordance with law for resumption of possession. [192D-E]
Partly allowing the appeals by the Development Authority,

HELD: 1.1 The Vice-Chairman, for purposes of s. 15(3) of
the Act is a distinct statutory authority with statutory
powers of his own distinct from Development Authority, which
under s. 4(2) is a body corporate having perpetual succession and common seal. [197C-D]

1.2 An order made by him under s. 15(3) of the Act
granting permission is not one of the orders revisable by
Government under s. 41(3). Such an order, under the scheme
of the Act, is not also appealable but assumes a _ finality
contemplated by s. 37. [197F-G]

1.3. The power of control of the State Government under
s. 41(1) consistent with the scheme of the Act, cannot be
construed as a source of power to authorise any authority or
functionary under the Act to do or carry out something which
that authority or functionary is not, otherwise, competent
to do or carrying under the Act. The section is not a Super
Henry VIII clause for the supply or source of additional
provisions and powers not already obtaining under the Act.
[198A-B]

2.1 The view of the High Court that in the absence of a
directive or authorisation from the Government under s.
41(1), the ViceChairman, acting as the statutory authority
dispensing permissions for development under the Act, cannot
revoke or cancel a permission once granted is clearly erroneous. [198F]

2.2 The grant of permission is part of or incidental to
the statutory power to regulate orderly development of the
‘development area' under the Act under regulatory laws. The
power to regulate with the obligations and functions that go
with and are incidental to it, are not pent or exhausted
with the grant of permission. The power of regulation which
stretches beyond the mere grant of permission, takes within
its sweep the power, in appropriate cases, to revoke or
cancel the permission as incidental or supplemental to the
power to grant. Otherwise, the planitude of the power to
regulate would be whittled own or even frustrated. [198F-H]
2.3 The power to grant, where the grant is itself vitiated
by fraud
181
or misrepresentation on the part of the grantee at the time
of obtaining the grant, or where the grantee, after the
grant violates the essential terms and conditions subject to
which grant is made, must therefore, be held to include the
power to revoke or cancel the permit, even in the absence of
any other express statutory provisions in that behalf. The
grounds must, of course, be such as would justify such
drastic action. This cancellation is a preventive step.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

There may, however, be cases of the third kind where the
grant may be voidable at the instance of the Development
Authority or otherwise entitling the Development Authority
to initiate appropriate declaratory or other action to get
rid of the effect of the permission. [199G -H; 200A-B]

2.4 It is erroneous to equate the powers under ss. 14
and 15 of the Act with judicial power which, in the absence
of express provisions, could not enable the review of a
judicial order after its exercise on the principle of functus officio. [198H; 199A]

Sardul Singh v. The District Food and Supplies Controller, Patiala andOrs., W.P. No. 126 of 1962 decided on
December 19, 1962 referred to.

3. The power of revocation or cancellation of the permission is akin to and partakes of a quasi-judicial complexion. In exercising the power the authority must bring to
bear an unbiased mind, consider impartially the objections
raised by the aggrieved party and decide the matter consistent with the principles of natural justice. The authority
cannot permit its decision to be influenced by the direction
of others as this would amount to abdication and surrender
of its discretion. It would then not be the authority's
discretion that is exercised, but someone else's. If an
authority hands over its discretion to another body it acts
ultra vires. Such an interference by a person or body extraneous to the power would plainly be contrary to the nature
of the power. conferred upon the authority. [200B-D]

Judicial Review of Administrative Action by S.A. de
Smith referred to.

In the instant case, however, there was no such’ surrender of discretion by the Authority. The directive from the
Government dated August 12, 1985 had spent itself out with
the then the Vice-Chairman declining to act in accordance
with it. The directive dated October 15, 1985 confined
itself only to the cancellation of the lease and as incidental thereto, required the stoppage of work pending decision
whether the lease should be cancelled or not. [201B-D]

182

 

4.1 It not unoften happens that what appears to be a
judicial review for breach of natural justice is, in reality, a review for abuse of discretion. [201H]

4.2 Judicial review under Article 226 cannot be converted into an appeal. Judicial review is directed, not against
the decision, but is confined to the examination of the
decision-making process. [202B]

4.3 When the issue raised in judicial review is whether
a decision is vitiated by taking into account irrelevant, or
neglecting to take into account of relevant, factors or is
so manifestly unreasonable that no reasonable authority,
entrusted with the power in question could reasonably have
made such a decision, the judicial review of the decision
making process includes examination as a matter of law, of
the relevance of the factors. In the instant case, it is,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

however, not necessary to go into the marits and relevance
of the grounds. [202F-H]

Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans,
[1982] 1 WLR 1155 referred to.

5. There has been a denial of natural justice in the
proceedings culminating in the order of cancellation. The
show cause notice itself is an impalpable congeries of
suspicions and fears, of relevant or irrelevant matter and
has included some trivia. On a matter of such importance
where the stakes are heavy for the lesses who claim to have
made large investments on the project and where a number of
grounds require the determination of factual matters of some
complexity, the statutory authority should, in the facts of
the case, have afforded a personal hearing to the lessees.
Both the show cause notice dated January 9, 1986 and the
subsequent order dated April 19, 1986 cannot, therefore, be
sustained. [203B-D]

It is left open to the statutory authority, should it
consider it necessary, to issue a fresh show cause notice
setting out the precise grounds, and afford a_ reasonable
opportunity, including an opportunity of personal hearing
and of adducing evidence wherever necessary to the respondent-lessees. In view of this liberty, reserved to the authority, the finding recorded by the High Court on the
merits of the grounds is set aside. [203D-E]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATACHALIAH, J. Special Leave Petitions (Civil)
4761 and 4762 of 1985 are by the State of Uttar Pradesh and its officers and SLPs 13298 and 11498
of 1987 by the Lucknow Development Authority, (LDA for short) a statutory body constituted under
Sec. 4(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Planning & Development Act, 1973 (Act for short) and its
Authorities. Seeking special leave to appeal from the common judgment dated 8.12-1986 of the High
Court of Judicature, Allahabad, in Writ Petition Nos. 68 19 of 1985 and 367 of 1986 which were
heard and decided along with three other writ-petitions i.e. WP 5521 & 5699 of 1985 and 3463 of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 7State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

1986. Special leave petitions 11515 of 1987 and SLP 11499 of 1987 are by the LDA and its Authorities
directed against the said common judgment dated 8.12.1986 in so far as it per- tains respectively to
W.P. 5699 of 1985 and 5521 of 1985. Special leave petition 11220 of 1987 is by the LDA and its
Authorities seeking leave to appeal from the Order in W.P. 3463 of 1986.

2. The Writ-petitions before the High Court were pre- ferred by the Respondent Lessees Sri D.P.
Singh and his mother Smt. Raj Lakshmi Devi, the heirs of Maharaja Patesh- wari Prasad Singh in
respect of Nazool land in Plot No. 10, Ashok Marg, Hasratganj, Lucknow, under deed dated
7.10.1961 commencing from 15.11.1961 and stated to expire on 31.3.1991. The proceedings arose out
of two matters. The first pertained to the legality of the Notice dated 19.11.1985 issued by the State
Government in cancelling the lease. The cancella
tion was challenged in two writ-petitions filed separately by Sri D.P. Singh and Smt. Raj Lakshmi
Devi in W.P. 6819 of 1985 and WP 367 of 1986 respectively. The High Court by its common order
dated 8.12.1986 allowing the said two writ- petitions quashed the said cancellation. In SLPs 4761
and 4762 of 1987 and in SLPs 13298 and 11498 of 1987 the Lucknow Development Authority have
assailed this part of the common order.

The second area of the controversy arises out of the order dated 19.4.1986 of the Vice-Chairman,
Lucknow Develop- ment Authority, (LDA for short) cancelling the earlier order dated 31.1.1985
granting permission under Sec. 15 of the Act in favour of the Respondent Lessees to develop the
lease- hold property by effecting thereon a multi-storeyed building called "Balarampur Towers"
comprising of flats etc. This cancellation was challenged by the two Lessees in the joint writ-petition
No 3463 of 1986. The High Court allowed this WritPetition also and has quashed the impugned
order dated 19.4.1986 by which the permission to build earlier granted was sought to be revoked. In
SLP 11220 of 1987 the LDA seeks leave to appeal against this part of the order. WPs 5699 of 1985
and 5521 of 1985 from which the LDA has preferred SLP 11515 of 1987 and SLP 11499 of 1987
respec- tively do not relate to or bear upon the substantial points of controversy between the parties.
They relate to certain incidental matters. Accordingly SLPs 11515 of 1987 and SLP 11499 of 1987
would be governed by the order made in the main SLPs.

3. Special leave is granted in all the petitions. We have heard Sri D.D. Thakur, learned Senior
Counsel for the LDA and its authorities; Sri Yogeshwar Prasad, learned senior counsel for the State
of Uttar Pradesh and its offi- cers and Sri Soli J. Sorabjee for the respondentLessees. The subject
matter of the lease is stated to be an extent of about 9885 Sq. Metres of Nazool land, which was
comprised in the lease in favour of a certain Mr. Edwards, granted in the year 1901 for a period of 30
years in the first-instance, with provision for renewal for two more terms of 30 years each. On
6.11.1936, there was the first renewal for 30 years effective from 1.4.1931 in favour of a certain Sri
Syed Ali Zahir, a transferee from Mr. Edwards. Sri Syed Ali Zaheer assigned his interest under the
lease in favour of Maharaja Pateshwari Prasad Singh of Balrampur. On 7.10.1961, there was a second
renewal in favour of the present respondents, as the heirs of the said Maharaja Sri Pateshwari
Prasad Singh.

4. On 11.8.1981, Respondent-lessees, in collaboration with M/s Ambar Builders (P) Limited applied
to the LDA under Sec. 15(1) of the Act for permission to put up a multi- storeyed building on the
demised property. The permission was refused on the ground, inter alia, that the proposed
construction would bring about a change in the user permit- ted under the lease. The lessees
preferred an appeal before the Appellate Authority who dismissed their appeal. The
RevisionPetition filed by the lessees before the Government under Sec. 41(1) of the Act was partly
allowed and the Government by its order dated 15.10.1984, remitted the matter to the appropriate
authority under the Act for a fresh consideration. On 31.3.1984, during the pendency of the
revision-petition respondents submitted a modified plan, styling the construction as consisting of
"residential- flats". After remand, the Nazool Officer is said to have given his "No objection
Certificate" dated 2.12.1984 for the grant of permission. The power of attorney holder of respondents, a certain Sri Pawan Kumar Aggarwai, filed an . affidavit dated 28.12.1984 before the
appropriate authority of the LDA in regard to their being no impediment under Urban Ceiling Laws
and the manner in which the Lessees propose to comply with any order that may eventually be made
in that behalf. Finally on 23.1.1985, the Vice-Chairman of LDA sanctioned the permission. This was
formally communicat- ed to the Respondents on 31.1.1985. The lessees were re- quired to, and did,
deposit Rs. 53,440 with the LDA towards what was called 'Malba' charges. This marked one stage of
the proceedings.

5. The next stage of the matter opened on 24.7.1985 with the issue of directions from Government
purporting to be under sec. 41(1) of the Act interdicting the progress of the construction as, in the
view of the Government, the lessees had violated the conditions of the lease; that the matter would
require further examination and that any further construction in the meanwhile would create
avoidable hard- ship to themselves. In W.P. 3732 of 1985 Respondent-Lessees challenged this
direction of the Government before the High Court, which allowed the petition and quashed those
direc- tions.

Thereafter, on 12.8.1985, the Government brought to the notice of the then Vice-Chairman of the
LDA what, according to Government, were serious illegalities in the sanction of the permission
dated 31.1.1985 and indicated to the Vice- Chairman that sanction earlier granted on 31.1.1985 be
reviewed and revoked. The Vice- Chairman, however, did not appear to share the view of
Government either as to the existence of any legal infirmi- ties in the grant of permission or as to the
availability and the justifiability of review of the permission suggested by Government. The
disinclination of the Vice-Chairman in this behalf was communicated to the Government by letter
dated 12.9.1985. This marked yet another stage of the pro- ceedings.

6. The State Government, apparently, was in no mood to relent. By communication No.
5062-37-37-3-1985 dated 15.10.1985 Shri Kamal Pandey, the then Secretary to Govern- ment of
Uttar Pradesh, wrote to the Chairman, LDA recapitu- lating therein the previous proceedings in the
matter of grant of permission for the "BalrampurTowers" on the lease- land and enumerating what,
according to Government, were serious infirmities in, and illegalities resulting from, the permission
and as to how the construction violated the terms and conditions of the lease and directed the
Chairman, LDA, to initiate immediate proceedings as directed in the said communication. To that
letter was annexed, a show-cause notice which the Chairman was asked to serve on the Lessees and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 9State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

the Builders associated with the construction. It is necessary to excerpt some portion of that
communication.

"It has come to the notice of the Govt. that in obtaining the said permission the
following illegalities, irregularities, material misrep- resentation, fraudulent
statements, conceal- ments of material facts etc. appear to have been committed."

Referring to the various alleged illegalities, and breaches of covenants and of violations of law
which, ac- cording to Government, vitiated the grant of permission to build and also render the lease
liable to forfeiture. The communication proceeded to direct the Chairman.

"Therefore, the Governor is pleased to direct you to serve the enclosed show cause
notice in the Maharani, Sri Singh and Builders and obtain their explanation within
three days of the service of the notice, give them an opportunity of heating on the
fourth day and submit your comments on the explanation along with your
recommendations in the light of the above mentioned circumstances along with your
report fixing the responsibility on the Vice- Chairman of the Lucknow Development
Authority and Officers/Officials of the Nazul and building section latest by 28th
October, 1985."

The relevant portions of the show cause notice annexed to the said letter and intended to be, and
was later, served on the respondents-Lessees said:

"Therefore, in compliance with the instruc- tions of the Govt. Maharani Raj Laxmi
Kumari Devi Sahiba and Sri Singh and M/s Arebar Builders (P) Ltd. are hereby given
the show cause notice and an opportunity of hearing and they are required to explain
within three days of the receipt of this notice as to why the Nazul lease granted in
their favour be not cancelled and the unauthorised construction be not demolished
for breach of the lease condi- tions and violation of the provisions of Urban Land and
Ceiling Act and for making fraudulent statement and misrepresentation in respect of
the land use in Lucknow Master Plan and on account of continuing constructions on
the basis of fraudulently obtained building per- mission."

"If the desired explanation is not received within three days of the service of this
notice by the undersigned, it will be presumed that they have nothing to say in their
defence and thereafter action for can- cellation of nazul lease and building permit and
the removal of the unauthorised construc- tions will be taken along with their
prosecu- tion for fraudulent statement and misrepresen- tation as contained in the
affidavit."

8. The respondents filed their objections and represen
tations against the proposed cancellation. But Government, by its order No. 5496/37-3/85 dated
19.11.1985, found the explanation unacceptable to it and proceeded to terminate the lease. The

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 10State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

operative part of the "notice" terminating the lease reads:

"Now therefore on account of the aforesaid breach of the lease conditions the
Governor of U.P. does hereby terminate the lease. You are required to hand over
posses- sion of the land and building standing thereon to Collector, Lucknow, within
30 days of the receipt of this notice otherwise action for eviction will be taken against
you at your cost."

This order was, as stated earlier, challenged by the respondentlessees in WP No. 3463 of 1986 before
the High Court.

9. So far as the permission for development of the property earlier granted on 31.1.1985 was
concerned, sepa- rate action was taken by the Vice-Chairman of the LDA who issued the notice
dated 9.1.1986 to the respondents requir- ing them to show-cause why the permission should not be
cancelled. Respondents objected to the proposed action; but the Vice Chairman found the objections
unacceptable and proceeded, by his order No. 363/VC/RBO/86 dated 19.4.1986, to cancel the
permission.

The operative portion of the said order dated 19.4.1985 reads:

"From the above it is clear that the above irregularities, material mis-representa- tion
and fradulent statements have been made along with the building map-plan and
other documents submitted by Sri D.P. Singh and he has deliberately concealed
material facts and mislead the Authority. Therefore, the permis- sion dated 31.1.1985
granted to him is being cancelled."

The two Lessees challenged this cancellation before the High Court in two separate writ petitions
filed by each of them in WP 68 19 of 1985 and WP 367 of 1986 respectively.

10. The High Court was persuaded to the view that the proceedings initiated and the action taken by
the Government and the Vice-Chairman of the LDA in the matter, respective- ly, of forfeiture of the
lease and the cancellation of the permission to build were both infirm in law and required, to be
quashed. Accordingly, writ petitions 6819 of 1985 and WP 367 of 1986 were allowed and the order
dated 19.11.1985 of the Government purporting to cancel the lease was quashed. Likewise, WP 3463
of 1986 filed jointly by the Lessees was allowed and the show cause notice dated 9.1.1986 as well as
the order dated 19.4.1986 of the Vice-Chairman cancelling the permission were quashed.

11. We may first take up the appeals of the State Gov- ernment and of the LDA assailing the order of
the High Court quashing the cancellation of the lease. Sri Yogeshwar Prasad for the appellants
submitted that the High Court fell into an error in allowing a matter, which should properly have
been the subject-matter of a civil-suit, to be agitated in proceedings under Article 226 of the
Constitution. Learned counsel submitted that the relationship between the parties was one of the
Lessor and Lessee; the dispute between them pertained to the question whether there were breaches
and non-performance of the covenants and conditions of the lease justifying the forfei- ture of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 11State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

lease, and that these matters, pertained to a private law situation and were not appropriately
matters for enforcement of public law remedies. Learned Counsel further submitted that the
question whether there were breaches of covenants on the part of the lessee involved the construction of the terms of the lease-deed and required evidence on the matter. Disputes of this nature,
learned counsel submit- ted, could not be resolved on mere affidavits. Thirdly, Sri Yogeshwar Prasad
submitted that on the merits of the conten- tions, the High Court should have noticed that even on
the facts admitted, there were clear violations of the covenants and conditions of the lease. Learned
counsel also submitted that the view of the High Court that a reasonable opportuni- ty of being
heard had been denied to the respondents was erroneous and that, at all events, no hearing could be
contemplated in the context for forfeiture of a lease of this nature.

Sri Sorabjee for the respondents contended that the State, even as a lessor, could not act arbitrarily
either in the grant or premature termination of the leases of public property and disputes arising in
such contexts cannot always be reckoned as private law situations and that, at all events, the
threatened exercise of extra-judicial re-entry by the State, being violative both of the limitations of
the powers of the State as lessor under the law of landlord and tenant and of its actions as State, is a
matter which re- quires to be mandated against.

12. The show-cause notice preceding the cancellation of the lease and the decision dated 19.11.1985
to cancel the lease, refer to and rely upon 10 grounds. Grounds 1 to 7 pertain to what the
Government consider to be violations and breaches of the terms and conditions of the lease. They
pertain to an alleged change of user, to subletting and sub-division of the leasehold property. The
grounds.also refer to the alleged non disclosure of the terms and condi- tions of the Memorandum
dated 7.7.1984 between the Lessees on the one hand and Messrs Amar Builders Private Limited on
the other. The grounds for forfeiture also refer to the likelihood of fraud being practised on the
prospective pur- chasers of the fiats as to the nature and extent of the lessees’ subsisting interest
under the lease and the limita- tions thereon.

We do not propose to go into the merits of these grounds and their sufficiency in law to support the
purported for- feiture as, in our view, this exercise, having regard to the disputed questions of fact
that are required to be gone into in that behalf, are extraneous to proceedings under Article 226 of
the Constitution.

13. In regard to the merits of the grounds for forfei- ture of the lease, the High Court after an
elaborate discus- sion of the relevance and tenability of each of the grounds, the learned judge held:

"From the comments made by me on the above nine grounds it would be seen that
some of the grounds are irrelevant or illusory or based on irrelevant material or on
non-exist- ent facts and some require serious considera- tion which has not been
given. It has also been seen that while under the lease-deed the right of re-entry could
be exercised only for a breach of the term of the lease in presenti, the lease has been
cancelled for a breach in future. In this view of the matter the im- pugned order of the
State Government cannot be sustained."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 42State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

Shri Yogeshwar Prasad says that this exercise Was extra
neous to a proceeding under Article 226 as the question whether the construction with 39 flats
would be one unit or multiplicity of units; whether if third party rights were created by the transfer,
or use, of the flat, that would amount to sub-letting or assignment; or would, in any other way,
violate the terms and conditions of the lease and the like, would not be matters that admit of being
satisfactori- ly resolved on mere affidavits. Learned counsel submitted that even according to the
learned judges there were serious questions to be examined.

14. On a consideration of the matter, we think, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the High
Court should have abstained from the examination of the legality or correctness of the purported
cancellation’ of the lease which involved resolution of disputes on questions of fact as well. In
Express News Papers v. Union of India, [1985] Supp. 3 SCR 382 Venkataramiah, J. in a somewhat
analogous situation observed:

"The rest of the questions relate truly to the civil rights of the parties flowing from the
lease deed. Those questions cannot be effectively disposed of in this petition under
Article 32 of the Constitution. The questions arising out of the lease, such as, whether
there has been breach of the convenants under the lease, whether the lease can be
forfeited, whether relief against forfeiture can be granted etc. are foreign to the scope
of Article 32 of the Constitution. They cannot be decided just on affidavits. These are
matters which should be tried in a regular civil proceeding. One should remember
that the property belongs to the Union of India and the rights in it cannot be bartered
away in ac- cordance with the sweet will of an Officer or a Minister or a Lt. Governor
but they should be dealt with in accordance with law. At the same time a person who
has acquired rights in such property cannot also be deprived of them except in
accordance with law. The stakes in this case are very high for both the parties and
neither of them can take law into his own hands."

Accordingly, we hold that the question whether the purported forfeiture and cancellation of the
lease were valid or not should not have been allowed to be agitated in proceedings under Article 226.

15. Sri Sorabjee submitted that great hardship and injustice would be occasioned to the respondents
if the State Government, on the self-assumed and self-assessed validity of its own action of
cancellation of the lease, attempts at and succeeds in, a resumption of possession extra-judicially by
physical force. Sri Sorabjee referred to the notice dated 19.11.1985 in which the Government, according to Sri Sorabjee, had left no-one in doubt as to its intentions of resorting to an extra-judicial
resumption of possession. Sri Sorabjee referred to paras 3.10 and 4 of the order dated 19.11.1985.

A lessor, with the best of title, has no right to resume possession extra-judicially by use of force,
from a lessee, even after the expiry or earlier termination of the lease by forfeiture or otherwise. The
use of the expression 're- entry' in the lease-deed does not authorise extrajudicial methods to
resume possession. Under law, the possession of a lessee, even after the expiry or its earlier
termination is juridical posSessiOn and forcible dispossession is prohibit- ed; a lessee cannot be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 13State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

dispossessed otherwise than in due course of law. In the present case, the fact that the lessor is the
State does not place it in any higher or better position. On the contrary, it is under an additional
inhibi- tion stemming from the requirement that all actions of Government and Governmental
authorities should have a ‘legal pedigree’. In Bishandas v. State of Punjab, [1962] 2 SCR 69 this
Court said:

"We must, therefore, repel the argument based on the contention that the petitioners
were trespassers and could be removed by an executive order. The argument is not
only specious but highly dangerous by reason of its implications and impact on law
and order."

"Before we part with this case, we feel it our duty to say that the executive action
taken in this case by the State and its officers is destructive of the basic principle of
the rule of law."

Therefore, there is no question in the present case of the Government thinking of appropriating to
itself an extra-judicial right of re-entry. Possession can be resumed by Government only in a manner
known to or recognised by law. It cannot resume possession otherwise than in accord- ance with
law. Government is, accordingly, prohibited from taking possession otherwise than in due course of
law. In the result, the appeals of the State of Utter Pradesh (SLPs 4761 and 4762 of 1987) and of the
LDA (SLPs 13298 and 11498 of 1987) directed against the common Judgment dated 8.12.1985 in so
far as it pertains to WP 6819 of 1985 and WP 357 of 1986 are allowed and the said two writ petitions
are dismissed, leaving the question of the legality and validity of the purported cancellation of the
lease and the defence of the lessees open to be urged in appropriate legal pro- ceedings, whenever
and wherever Government proceeds to initiate action in accordance with law for resumption of
possession on the basis of the alleged cancellation or forfeiture of the lease. Any developmental work
that may be made by the lessees or at their instance would, of course, be at their own risk and shall
be subject to the result of such proceedings.

17. We may now turn to the controversy of the cancella- tion or revocation dated 19.4.1986 of the
permission earlier granted under section 15 of the "Act", which was the subject matter of writ
petition No. 3463 of 1986. The order of revocation was passed by the successor Vice-Chairman, Shri
Govindan Nair, IAS. The earlier permission was granted by the then Vice-Chairman, Shri Babu
Ram.

A show cause notice dated 9.1.1986 preceding the cancel- lation was issued by Vice-Chairman, Shri
Govindan Nair himself. The order dated 19.4.1986 revoking the permission was challenged before
the High Court on four grounds, viz.,

(a) that the lessees had had no reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed
in the notice dated. 9.1.1986 and that an opportunity of an oral hearing had been denied; (b) that the
Vice-Chairman, under the provi- sions of the Act had no authority or power to revoke a permission
once granted; (c) that, at all events, the les- sees having incurred enormous expenditure on the
development work, and having, on the strength of the permission granted earlier on 31.1.1985,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 14State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

altered their position substantially to their disadvantage, the Vice-Chairman was estopped from
revoking the permission on principles of promissory estop- pel; and (d) that the grounds on which
cancellation rested were themselves irrelevant and insufficient in law to sup- port the cancellation.
The High Court accepted grounds at

(a), (b) and (d). It did not find it necessary to go into ground (c) in regard to which the High Court
observed:

"The petitioners also contended that the ViceChairman of Lucknow Development Authority was estopped from cancelling the sanction to build, more so when it was acted
UPON saveesvesnvsvevsscvevas In the instant case this question need not be gone into detail
inasmuch as sanction to build was sought to be cancelled on the ground of suppression of material facts, fraud and misrep- resentation etc."

In regard to the Lessees', grievance at (a) supra of denial of natural justice, the High Court said:

"He even did not give any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner on the said
question and passed an order some 2 1/2 months thereaf- ter without even touching
the objection of the petitioner regarding the competence and juris- diction of the
Vice-Chairman. Some new facts which found place in para 3 of the show cause notice
also found place in the order. The Vice-Chairman did not make any enquiry into
those facts including construction of three buildings in the city itself and as such it
became still more necessary on him to give atleast a personal hearing to the
petitioner. As hearing has not been given to the petition- er although there was
enough time for the same, the order passed by the ViceChairman violates the
principles of natural justice and cannot be sustained.

On the contention (b), the High Court held that the ViceChairman had no power to review the
earlier order. The High Court was of the view--and this is exactly the opposite of Sri Sorabjee's
contention before us--that the Vice-Chair- man could derive power to review only if he had been
empowered by Government by a direction under section 41(1) of the Act. The High Court said:

"It has not been pleaded by opposite parties that on 9.1.1986 when the new ViceChairman took over charge or on any date thereafter the state Government issued
any direction to him to issue any show cause notice to the petitioners. There is no
other provision in the Development Act conferring powers on the Vice-Chairman to
review the decision in the matter of sanctioning a plan to build. In the absence of any
provision in the Act or any direction issued by the State Government, the
ViceChairman had no jurisdic- tion or authority to reconsider the decision granting
sanction to a plan i.e. permit to build after the same was acted upon and constructions were being made only in accordance with it."

As to ground (d), the High Court examined the merits of each of the grounds and, in substance,
came to the conclu- sion that the grounds were either irrelevant or, otherwise, insufficient in law to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 15State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

support the purported cancellation. The High Court held:

"The above discussion shows that even though fraud, misrepresentation and
concealment of facts etc. on the part of the petitioners having not been made out, yet
such conclusions have been arrived at. The matter essentially hinged on the meaning
and interpretation of the word 'Building' and instead of doing it in the right and
correct perspectives, suspicion 'and presumptions have been made in arriving at the
conclusions so arrived at."

19. Shri Thakur assailed the conclusions reached by the High Court on all the three questions.
Learned counsel urged that the order dated 19.4.1986 itself discloses the extent of the opportunities
afforded to the Lessees and there could, therefore, be no question of failure of natural. justice in this
case. As to the Vice-Chairman's power to cancel or to revoke a permission earlier granted, Sri
Thakur submitted that if the permission had been obtained by the lessees by misrepresentation or
fraud or, if after obtaining the permission there had been violation of the terms and conditions of
the grant, the statutory authority granting the permission has itself the inherent and incidental and
supplemental powers to revoke the permission, and that no express grant of power in this behalf
was necessary. Shri Thakur submitted that the grounds in this case related not only to fraud and
misrepre- sentation practised at the time of securing the permission but also violation of the terms
and conditions of the grant itself. He further submitted that there was material on record to show
that the officers and the authorities of the LDA concerned with the grant of the permission under
section 15 had betrayed the trust reposed in them by the statute and were disloyal to the
Development Authority and on that ground also the successor Vice-Chairman could revoke and
rescind the sanction so vitiated by fraud. Shri Thakur relied upon Sec. 21 of General Clauses Act for
the exercise of the power to revoke.

20. Shri Sorabjee for the Lessees, however, maintained that the Vice-Chairman, having regard to the
nature of the allegations on which the revocation is purported and which fell in the last category
mentioned by Sri Thakur, had no authority in law to cancel the permission. He submitted that the
view of the High Court as to the irrelevance and insuf- ficiency in law of the grounds on which the
purported can- cellation was based were effect as they were well known administrative law tests of
administrative or statutory discretion, and that appeal to Section 21 of the General Clauses Act to
sustain the review was wholly inapposite in this case. Sri Sorabjee submitted that the' power to
cancel or. revoke a licence or permission, even assuming that the Statute enabled such cancellation,
was clearly distinguisha- ble from a power of refusal of an initial grant and that the exercise of the
power of cancellation which prejudically affects vested rights partake predominently of quasi-judicial complexion and where, as here, such power is resorted to at the behest of some-body extraneous
to the power, there would be an abdication and surrender of the statutory dis- cretion vitiating the
decision. Sri Sorabjee said that the ViceChairman, even granting that he had power to cancel, acted
at the behest of the Government which purported to Act under Section 41(1) issued directives on
12.8.1985 and on 15.10.1985 overriding the discretion of the Vice-Chairman.

21. To appreciate these contentions in their proper perspective it is necessary to notice the scheme of
the Act in relation to the Regulation of Development in the "Devel- opment Area" under the Act. The

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 16State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

preamble of the Act says:

"In the developing areas of the State of Uttar Pradesh the problems of town planning
and urban development need to be tackled resolute- ly. The existing local bodies and
other au- thorities in spite of their best efforts have not been able to cope with these
problems to the desired extent. In order to bring about improvement in this situation,
the State Government consid- ered it advisable that in such developing areas,
Development Authorities patterned on the Delhi Development Authority be established. As the State Government was of the view that the urban development and
planning work in the State had already been delayed it was felt necessary to provide
for early estab- lishment of such Authorities."

Sec. 2(b), (e) and (f) defines "building" "Development"
and "Development Area":

"2(b) ‘building’ includes any struc- ture or erection or part of a structure or erection
which is intended to be used for residential, industrial, commercial or other purposes
whether in actual use or not." "2(e) 'development', with its gram- matical variations,
means the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other opera- tions in, on
over or under land, or the making of any material change in any building or land, and
includes re-development." "2(f) 'development area’ means any area declared to be
development area under Section 3."

Section 3 provides:

"Declaration of development areas: If in the opinion of the State Government any
area within the State requires to be developed according to plan it may, by
notification in the Gazette, declare the area to be a develop- ment area.”

Section 14(1) provides:

Development of land in the developed area.--After the declaration of any area as
development area under Section 3, no develop- ment of land shall be undertaken or
carried out or continued in that area by any person or body (including a department
of Government) unless permission for such development has been obtained in
writing from the (Vice-Chair- man) in accordance with the provisions of this Act."

Section 15(1) provides:

"Application for permission--Every person or body (other than any department of
Government or any local authority) desiring to obtain the permission referred to in
Section 14 shah make an application in writing to the (ViceChairman) in such form

and containing such particulars in respect of the development to which the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

application relates as may be prescribed by (bye laws)."

Section 15(3) provides that on receipt of an application for permission for development, the
Vice-Chairman, after making such enquiry as he considers necessary in relation to matters specified
in Sec. 9(2)(d) or any other matter by order in writing either grant the permission subject to such
conditions as he may specify or refuse the permission. The Vice-Chairman, for purposes of Section
15(3) is a distinct statutory authority with statutory powers of his own dis- tinct from the
"Development Authority" which under section 4(2) is a body corporate having perpetual succession
and common seal.

Section 15(5) contemplates and enables an appeal to the Chairman against an order made by the
Vice-Chairman refusing permission.

Section 37, inter alia, makes an order of the Vice- Chairman made under Sec. 15 final.

22. Section 41(3) enables the State Government either on its own motion or on an application made
to it in this behalf to call for the records of any case disposed of or order passed by the Authority or
the Chairman for purposes of satisfying itself as to its legality or propriety and may pass such orders
or issue such directions in relation there- to as it may think fit. It is relevant to note that an order
made by an Vice-Chairman under Sec. 15(3) of the Act grant- ing permission is not one of the orders
revisable by Govern- ment under section 41(3). Such an order, under the scheme of the Act, is not
also appealable but assumes a finality contemplated by Sec. 37.

23. Sec. 41(1) of the Act provides:

"Control by State Government--The (Authority, the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman)
shah carry out such directions as may be issued to it from time to time by the State
Government for the efficient administration of this Act."

This power of the State Government consistent with the scheme of the Act, cannot be construed as a
source of power to authorise any authority or functionary under the Act to do or carry out something
which that authority or function- ary is not, otherwise, competent to do or carryout under the Act.
Section 41(1) is not a Super Henry VIII clause for the supply or source of additional provisions and
powers not already obtaining under the ‘Act’.

Sri Sorabjee for the Lessees says that the proceedings for cancellation were initiated at the instance
of and compelled by the directives issued by Government under Section 41(1) and that therefore
there was a surrender of discretion by the statutory Authority viz., the ViceChair- man. Here is a
piquant situation. The High Court says that section 41(1) could authorise the Vice-Chairman to
review the earlier permission but that there being no such direc- tive, the Vice-Chairman had no
power to review. The High Court was in effect, held that the earlier directive dated 15.10.1985 under
Sec. 41(1) was limited to the cancellation of the lease and for suspension of the building work in the
interrugnam as incidental thereto and that the show cause notice dated 9.1.1986 for cancellation of
the permission was not pursuant to any directive under Sec. 41(1). Thus, the legal position which the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 18State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

High Court assumes as to the scope of Sec. 41(1) is precisely what Shri Sorabjee contends against.

22. It appears to us that view of the High Court that in the absence of a directive or authorisation
from the Govern- ment under Section 41(1), the Vice-Chairman, acting as the statutory authority
dispensing permissions for development under the Act, cannot revoke or cancel a permission once
granted is clearly erroneous. In this case the grant of permission is part of or incidental to the
statutory power to regulate orderly development of the "Development Area" under the Act under
Regulatory Laws. The power to regulate with the obligations and functions that go with and are
incidental to it, are not spent or exhausted with the grant of permission. The power of regulation
which stretches beyond the mere grant of permission, takes within its sweep the power, in
appropriate cases, to revoke or cancel the permission as incidental or supplemental to the power to
grant. Otherwise the planitude of the power to regulate would be whittled down or even frustrated.
It is erroneous to equate the powers under sections 14 and 15 of the Act with Judicial power which,
in the absence of express provisions, could not enable the review of a judicial order after its exercise
on the principle of Functus-Officio. In Sardul Singh v. The District Food and Supplies Controller,
Patiala and Ors., in writ petition 126/ 1962 DD 19.12.1962 a statutory order, promulgated under sec
3 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, contained a provision enabling the cancellation of a
‘permit' under certain circumstances. The contention was that section 3 of the parent ‘Act' itself did
not delegate to the subordinate legislative authority to make such a provision for cancellation and,
therefore, the provision for cancellation in the subordinate legislature was ultra vires. There was no
provision in the Act expressly conferring the power to make a provision for cancellation of the
permit. Section 3(2)(d) of the parent Act merely enabled the government to make orders "for
Regulating by licences, permits or otherwise, the storage, transport, distribution, disposal,
acquisition, use or consumption of any essential commodity" and Section 3(2)(j) merely enabled
Government to make orders for incidental and supplementary matters (empha- sis supplied). The
question arose whether provisions for cancellation of the permits envisaged in para 10 of the
particular statutory order could be said to be relatable to or justified as a matter incidental or
supplementary to Regulation. This Court held that the power to cancel was an "incidental and
supplementary" matter. It was held:

"If a trade in an essential commodi- ty like coal is to be regulated by licenses or
permits, it is obvious that the power to grant licenses or permits must include the
power to cancel or suspend such licenses or permits as an “incidental or
supplementary matter"; otherwise, the very purpose of S. 3 of the Act would be
frustrated."

23. Indeed, the submissions of Sri Thakur on the point contemplate the exercise of the power to
cancel or revoke the permission in three distinct situations. The first is where the grant is itself
vitiated by fraud or misrepresen- tation on the part of the grantee at the time of obtaining the grant.
To the second situation belong the class of cases where the grantee, after the grant violates the
essential terms and conditions subject to which the grant is made. In these two areas, the power to
grant must be held to include the power to revoke or cancel the permit, even in the ab- sence of any
other express statutory provisions in that behalf. There must, of course be the compliance with the
requirements of natural justice and the grounds must be such as would justify such drastic action.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 19State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

This cancellation is a preventive step. The one aspect of the remedial measures is set-out in Section
27 of the Act. There may be cases of third kind where the grant may be voidable at the instance of
the Development Authority or otherwise entitling the Development Authority to initiate appropriate
declaratory or other action to get rid of the effect of the permission.

It is true that in exercise of powers of revoking or cancelling the permission is akin to and partakes
of a quasi-judicial complexion and that in exercising of the former power the authority must bring to
bear an unbiased mind, consider impartially the objections raised by the aggrieved party and decide
the matter consistent with the principles of natural justice. The authority cannot permit its decision
to be influenced by the dictation of others as this would amount to abdication and surrender of its
discre- tion. It would then not be the Authority's discretion that is exercised, but someone else's. If
an authority "hands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires". Such an interference by a
person or body extraneous to the power would plainly be contrary to the nature of the power
conferred upon the authority. De Smith sums up the position thus:

"The relevant principles formulated by the courts may be broadly summarised as
follows. The authority in which a discretion is vested can be compelled to exercise
that discretion, but not to exercise it in any particular manner. In general, a
discretion must be exercised only by the authority to which it is committed. That
authority must genuinely address itself to the matter before it: it must not act under
the dictation of another body or disable itself from exercising a discretion in each
individual case. In the purported exercise of its discretion it must not do what it has
been forbidden to do, nor must it do what it has not been authorised to do. It must
act in good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations and must not be
swayed by irrelevant considerations, must not seek to promote purposes alien to the
letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and must not act
arbitrarily or capriciously. Nor where a judgment must be made that certain facts
exist can a discretion be validly exercised on the basis of an erroneous assumption
about those facts. These several principles can conven- iently be grouped in two main
categories: failure to exercise a discretion, and excess or abuse of discretionary
power. The two classes are not, however, mutually exclusive."

25. But the question is whether the issue of the show cause notice or the subsequent decision to
cancel could be said to have been made at the behest or compulsion of Gov- ernment. Shri Sorabjee
refers to paragraphs 17 and 18 of Shri Kamal Pandey's letter dated 15.10.1985. We are not sure that
this is a correct understanding of the position. The High Court did not see any casual connection
between the Government's directive dated 15.10.1985 and the proceedings initiated by the
Vice-Chairman on 9.1.1986. The High Court was of the view that directive confined itself to the cancellation of the lease and as incidental thereto, required the stoppage of work pending decision
whether the lease should be cancelled or not. This infact, was the basis for holding that the
Vice-Chairman had no power to cancel. Lessees do not rely upon any subsequent directive to the
ViceChairman from the Government in the matter of revocation of the permission. The earlier
directive dated 12.8.1985 from the Government to the Vice-Chairman spent itself out with the then
ViceChairman declining to act in accordance with it. There is no material to hold that Sri Govardhan

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 20State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

Nair felt himself bound by that directive. Sri Sorabjee's contention based on an alleged surrender of
discretion cannot, therefore, be upheld.

26. It has, therefore, to be held that the finding of the High Court that the Vice-Chairman had no
competence to initiate proceedings to revoke the permission on the ground that the permission itself
had been obtained by misrepresen- tation and fraud and on the ground that there were viola- tions
of the conditions of the grant, appear to us to be unsupportable. The contention of the
Respondent-Lessees that the show cause notice, dated 9.1.1986 and the cancellation order, dated
19.4.1986, are vitiated by a surrender of a discretion on the part of the Vice-Chairman cannot also be
held to be well-founded. Sri Thakur's contention to the contrary on both these points would require
to be accepted.

27. Now in the end, two more findings of the High Court remain to be considered, viz., on the
Lessees' grievance of denial of reasonable opportunity of being heard and the validity and
sufficiency of the alleged grounds to sustain the cancellation. We may consider the latter, first:

28. It not unoften happens that what appears to be a judicial review for breach of natural justice is,
in reali- ty, a review for abuse of discretion. It is true that amongst the many grounds' put forward in
the show cause notice dated 19.1.1986, quite a few overlap each other and are distinguishable from
those urged for the cancellation of the lease itself. Some of the grounds might, perhaps, be
somewhat premature. Some of them even if true are so trivial that no authority could reasonably be
expected to cancel the permission on that basis. For instance the ground that the permission was
applied for and granted in the name of one only of the two lessees would be one such.

However, Judicial review under Article 226 cannot be converted into an appeal. Judicial review is
directed, not against the decision, but is confined to the examination of the decision
making-process. In Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans, [1982] 1 WLR 1155 refers to
the merits-legality distinction in judicial review. Lord Hail- sham said:

"The purpose "of judicial review is to ensure that the individual receives fair
treatment, and not to ensure that the authority, after according fair treatment,
reaches on a matter which it is authorised by law to decide for itself a conclusion
which is correct in the eyes of the court."

Lord Brightman observed:

"

awe Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a
review of the manner in which the decision was made ....."

And held that it would be an error to think:

"

usar that the court sits in judgment not only on the correctness of the
decision-making process but also on the correctness of the decision itself.”

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808782/ 21State Of U.P. & Ors vs Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh ... on 17 January, 1989

When the issue raised in judicial review is whether a decision is vitiated by taking into account
irrelevant, or neglecting to take into account of relevant, factors or is so manifestly unreasonable
that no reasonable authority, entrusted with the power in question could reasonably have made such
a decision, the judicial review of the decision making process includes examination, as a matter of
law, of the relevance of the factors. In the present case, it is, however, not necessary to go into the
merits and relevance of the grounds having regard to the view we propose to take on the point on
natural justice.

It would, however, be appropriate for the statutory authori- ty, if it proposes to initiate action afresh,
to classify the grounds pointing out which grounds, in its opinion, support the allegation of fraud or
misre-presentation and which, in its view constitute subsequent violations of the terms and
conditions of the grant. The grounds must be specific so as to afford the Lessees an effective
opportunity of showing cause.

29. On the point of denial of natural justice, we agree with conclusion of the High Court, though not
for the same reasons, that there has been such a denial in the proceed- ings culminating in the order
of cancellation. The show cause notice itself an impalpable congeries of suspicions and fears, of
relevant or irrelevant matter and has included some trivia. On a matter of such importance where
the stakes are heavy for the Lessees who claim to have made large investments on the project and
where a number of grounds require the determination of factual matters of some com- plexity, the
statutory authority should, in the facts of this case, have afforded a personal heating to the lessees.
We, therefore, agree with the conclusion of the High Court that both the show cause notice dated
9-1.1986 and the subsequent order dated 19.4-1986 would require to be quashed, however, leaving it
open to the statutory authori- ty, should it consider it necessary, to issue a fresh show cause notice
setting out the precise grounds, and afford a reasonable opportunity including an opportunity of
personal heating and of adducing evidence wherever necessary to the Respondent-Lessees- In view
of this liberty, reserved to the authority, it is necessary to setaside the findings recorded by the High
Court on the merits of the grounds. The appeal of the Lucknow Development Authority arising out
of SLP 11220 of 1987 is partly allowed and the order of the High Court in WP 3463] 1986 modified
accordingly. Appeals arising out of SLPs 11515 of 1987 and 11499 of 1987 of the LDA directed against
the common judgment of the High Court in so far as it relates to WP 5699 of 1985 and WP 5521 of
1985 also disposed of in the light of the order is made in the appeals arising out of SLPs 4761, 4762,
13298, 11498 and 11220 of 1987.

30. In the circumstances, we leave the parties to bear and pay their own costs.

P.S.S. Appeals allowed partly.

ALL Manipur Pensioners Association . Appellant
by its Secretary

Versus

The State of Manipur and others . .Respondents

JUDGMENT
M.R. SHAH, J.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division
Bench of the High Signature Not Verified Court of Manipur at Imphal dated 01.03.2016 passed in
Writ Digitally signed by NARENDRA PRASAD Date: 2019.07.11 17:56:50 IST Reason:

Appeal No. 28 of 2006, by which the Division Bench of the High Court has allowed the said appeal
preferred by the respondent State and has quashed and set aside the judgment and order dated
24.3.2005 passed by the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition (C) No. 1455 of 2000, by which the
learned Single Judge held that the method of calculating the revised pension in paragraph 4.1 of the
office memorandum dated 24.4.1999 in respect of preL1996 pensioners is different from the method
of calculating the revised pension for the Government employees who retired/died in harness on or
after 1.1.1996 is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, the original writ
petitioners have preferred the present appeal.

 

2. The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under:

That the State of Manipur adopted the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, as amended
from time to time. As per Rule 49 of the Central Civil Services Rules, 1972, a case of a government
employee retired in accordance with the provisions of the rules after completing qualifying service of
not less than 30 years, the amount of pension shall be calculated at 50% of the average emoluments
subject to a maximum of Rs.4500/Liper month. It appears that considering the increase in the cost

 

 

 

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186174315/ 1The All Manipur Pensioners Assn. ... vs The State Of Manipur . on 11 July, 2019

of living, the Government of Manipur decided to increase the quantum of pension as well as the pay
of the employees. That the Government of Manipur issued an office memorandum dated 21.4.1999
revising the quantum of pension. However, provided that those Manipur Government employees
who retired on or after 1.1.1996 shall be entitled to the revised pension at a higher percentage and
those who retired before 1.1.1996 shall be entitled at a lower percentage.

2.1 Feeling aggrieved by office memorandum dated 21.4.1999 providing two different revised
pensions, viz, the higher percentage of revised pension to the government employees who retired on
or after 1.1.1996 and the lower percentage of revised pension to those who retired on or before
1.1.1996, the appellant herein All Manipur Pensioners Association approached the learned Single
Judge of the High Court of Manipur by way of Writ Petition (C) No.1455 of 2000. It was the case on
behalf of the original writ petitioners that all the pensioners who retired on or after 1.1.1996 and
those who retired before 1.1.1996 form only one class as a whole and therefore the classification
between those who retired on or after 1.1.1996 and those who retired on or before 1.1.1996 for the
purpose of granting the benefit of revised pension is arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article
14 of the Constitution of India. It was submitted that the date of retirement cannot form the very
criterion for classification. Before the learned Single Judge, heavily reliance was placed on the
decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara and others vs. Union of India, reported in (1983) 1
SCC 305. The writ petition before the learned Single Judge was opposed by the State Government
and the aforesaid classification was sought to be justified solely on the ground that considering the
financial constraints of the State, the State was justified in granting revised pension differently to
those who retired after 1.1.1996 and those who retired before 1.1.1996. It was the case on behalf of
the State that considering the financial constraints of the State, the State was not in a position to
extend the benefit of pension making the percentage given by the Government of India in its
memorandum dated 17.12.1998 to the preL1996 pensioners and accordingly a decision was taken to
extend the benefit of revised pension at certain percentage for the pre(1996 pensioners and higher
percentage for the post 1996 pensioners. Relying upon the decision of this Court in D.S. Nakaras
case (supra), by the judgment and order dated 24.3.2005, the learned Single Judge allowed the writ
petition and held the classification between those pensioners who retired prior to 1996 and those
who retired after 1996 as arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and
consequently directed the State Government to pay the revised pension uniformly to all the
pensioners irrespective of any cutLoff date, i.e., those who retired preL1996 or those who retired
postLig96.

 

 

 

 

 

2.2. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order dated 24.3.2005 passed by the
learned Single Judge in Writ Petition (C) No. 1455 of 2000, the State preferred appeal before the
Division Bench of the High Court. By the impugned judgment and order dated 1.3.2016, the Division
Bench of the High Court has allowed the said appeal and has quashed and set aside the judgment
and order passed by the learned Single Judge by observing that a classification is permissible and
cutLoff date can be pressed into service depending on financial resources of the State. The Division
Bench has held that the cutLoff date fixed by the State government as 1.1.1996 for payment of
revised pension to preL1996 retirees and postL1996 retirees cannot be termed to be unreasonable or
irrational in the light of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and therefore need not be held to be
invalid.

3. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division
Bench of the High Court, the original writ petitioners have preferred the present appeal.

4. Shri R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior Advocate has appeared for the appellant herein and Shri
Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Advocate has appeared for the State.

4.1 Shri R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant
Pensioners Association has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case,
the Division Bench of the High Court has materially erred in allowing the appeal and quashing and
setting aside the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court and
approving the creation of two classes of pensioners, viz., preL4996 and post4996 for the purpose of
revision in pension, which is contrary to catena of decisions of this Court including the decision of
this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra).

 

4.2 It is further submitted by Shri R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior Advocate appearing on
behalf of the appellant Pensioners Association that the Division Bench of the High Court has
materially erred in not following the decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra). It is
submitted that the Division Bench of the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that the
decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) has not been diluted at all in any of the
subsequent decisions and still holds the field. It is submitted that the decisions of this Court in the
cases of Hari Ram Gupta (D) through L.R. Kasturi Devi v. State of U.P., reported in (1998) 6 SCC
328; T.N. Electricity Board v. R. Veerasamy & others, reported in (1999) 3 SCC 414; State of Punjab
and others v. Amar Nath Goyal & others, reported in (2005) 6 SCC 754, which came to be
considered by the Division Bench of the High Court while not following the decision of this Court in
the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand and all the
aforesaid decisions are clearly distinguishable.

4.3 It is further submitted by Shri R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior Advocate appearing on
behalf of the appellant Pensioners Association that the Division Bench of the High Court has erred
in not properly appreciating the fact that all the pensioners form only one class as a whole and
therefore they cannot be divided in two/classified into two groups for the purpose of giving more
financial benefits to one group than the other. It is submitted that the States financial
difficulty/constraint cannot be a ground to discriminate and/or create two classes who as such
belong to one class only. 4.4 It is further submitted by Shri R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior
Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant Pensioners Association that the High Court has not
properly appreciated the fact that all the pensioners, whether they have retired preLi996 or
postL1996 are governed by the pension rules and are entitled to pension and therefore as such they
form only one class as a whole and therefore all the pensioners are entitled to the same pensionary
benefits irrespective of their date of retirement.

 

 

4.5 It is further submitted by Shri R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior Advocate appearing on
behalf of the appellant Pensioners Association that as held by this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara
(supra) (para 42), the classification has to be based on some rational principle and the rational
principle must have nexus to the objects sought to be achieved. It is submitted that if the State

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186174315/ 3The All Manipur Pensioners Assn. ... vs The State Of Manipur . on 11 July, 2019

Government considered it necessary to revise the pension due to the escalation in the cost of living
and other things, there is no rational principle behind it for granting the revised pension only to
those who retired post41996 and simultaneously denying the same to those who retired preLi996. It
is vehemently submitted that if the revision of pension was necessitated due to the escalation in the
cost of living etc., there is no reason to deny the benefit of revised pension to those who retired
prelig996. It is submitted that therefore this revision which classified pension into two classes is not
based on any rational principle. It is submitted that as held by this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara
(supra) if the rational principle is the one of dividing pensioners with a view to giving something
more to persons otherwise equally placed, it would be discriminatory. It is submitted that this
arbitrary division has not only no nexus to the revision in pension but it is counterproductive and
runs counter to the whole gamut of pension scheme, more particularly the revision in pension.

 

 

 

4.6 It is further submitted by Shri R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior Advocate appearing on
behalf of the appellant Pensioners Association that the only justification by the State to create two
classes for the purposes of payment of revision in pension, viz., those who retired preL1996 and
those who retired post4996 was the financial constraint. It is submitted that the aforesaid has no
nexus with the object and purpose of revision in pension. It is submitted therefore that such a
classification is absolutely arbitrary and therefore violative of Articles 14 & 16 of the Constitution of
India. It is submitted that as such the learned Single Judge of the High Court was justified in
holding creation of two classes for the purpose of revision in pension as arbitrary and violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 4.7 It is further submitted by Shri R. Balasubramanian,
learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant Pensioners Association that looking to
the object and purpose of the revision in pension, namely, increase in the cost of living, the Division
Bench of the High Court has materially erred in observing and holding that as the State does not
have the financial resources to pay uniform pension to all the retired employees and therefore
cutLoff date fixed by the State Government as 1.1.1996 for payment of revised pension to prel1996
retirees and postL1996 retirees cannot be termed to be unreasonable or irrational in the light of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It is submitted that the aforesaid finding recorded by the
Division Bench of the High Court is just contrary to the decision of this Court in the case of D.S.
Nakara (supra) and other subsequent decisions in which the decision of this Court in the case of D.S.
Nakara(supra) has been followed. 4.8 It is further submitted by Shri R. Balasubramanian, learned
Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant Pensioners Association that in the present case
the decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) is squarely applicable to the facts of the
case. It is submitted therefore that the Division Bench of the High Court has materially erred in
quashing and setting aside the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge in holding
the decision of the State Government creating two groups for the purpose of revision in pension as
arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.9 Making the above submissions and heavily relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of
D.S. Nakara(supra), it is prayed to allow the present appeal.

5. The present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Advocate
appearing on behalf of the respondent State.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186174315/ 4The All Manipur Pensioners Assn. ... vs The State Of Manipur . on 11 July, 2019

5.1 It is vehemently submitted by Shri Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf
of the respondent State that in the facts and circumstances of the case and after considering the
observations made by this Court in the cases of Hari Ram Gupta (supra), R. Veerasamy (supra) and
Amar Nath Goyal (supra), the Division Bench of the High Court has rightly held that the cutLoff
date fixed by the State Government for the purpose of revised pension cannot be said to be
unreasonable or irrational in the light of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 5.2 It is further
submitted by Shri Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent
State that the decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra), which has been heavily relied
upon by the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant Pensioners Association,
subsequently came to be considered by this Court and it has been observed that the decision of this
Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) is one of the limited application and there is no scope for
enlarging the ambit of that decision to cover all schemes made by the retirees or a demand for an
identical amount of pension irrespective of the date of retirement. In support of his above
submission, Shri Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent
State has heavily relied upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of Indian ExLServices League v.
Union of India, reported in (1991) 2 SCC 104, Union of India v. P.N. Menon, reported in (1994) 4
SCC 68 and State of Rajasthan v. Amrit Lal Gandhi, reported in (1997) 2 SCC 342.

 

5-3 Shri Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent State has
also heavily relied upon some of the observations made by this Court in the case of Kallakkurichi
Taluk Retired Officials Association, Tamil Nadu and others v. State of Tamil Nadu, reported in
(2013) 2 SCC 772 in support of his submission that financial constraint can be a valid ground to
grant the benefit of revised pension to some of the pensioners and it is always open to the State
Government looking to its own financial constraint to grant the benefit of revised pension by
providing the cutLoff date. It is submitted therefore that such a classification and/or creation of two
groups for the purpose of granting the benefit of revised pension cannot be said to be unreasonable,
irrational and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as sought to be contended on behalf
of the Pensioners Association.

 

5.4 Making the above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions, it is prayed to dismiss
the present appeal.

6. We have heard the learned Senior Advocates for the respective parties at length.

6.1 It is not in dispute that the State of Manipur has adopted the Central Civil Services (Pension)
Rules to be applicable to the State of Manipur. Therefore, all the government servants retired in
accordance with the provisions of the Pension Rules and after completing qualifying service are
entitled to the pension/pensionary benefits. It appears that considering the increase in the cost of
living, the State Government enhanced/revised the pension of its employees with effect from
1.1.1996 as in the case of Central Government employees. However, this revision in pension was
done differently, viz., for employees who retired prior to 1.1.1996 and for employees who retired
after 1.1.1996. Consequently, the State provided a lower percentage of increase to those who retired
preli996 and provided higher percentage of increase to those who retired postL1996. The learned
Single Judge of the High Court held that such a classification is not permissible in law keeping in

 

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186174315/ 5The All Manipur Pensioners Assn. ... vs The State Of Manipur . on 11 July, 2019

mind the equality clause of the Constitution. However, on an appeal, by the impugned judgment and
order, the Division Bench of the High Court has reversed the decision of the learned Single Judge
and has observed and held that as in the present case the State does not have the financial resources
to pay uniform pension to all the retired employees, the cutLoff date fixed by the State Government
as 1.1.1996 for payment of revised pension to preLl1996 retirees and postL1996 retirees cannot be
termed to be unreasonable and irrational in the light of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. While
passing the impugned judgment and order, the Division Bench of the High Court has not followed
the decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra), considering some of the observations
made by this Court in the subsequent decisions in the cases of R. Veerasamy (supra); Amar Nath
Goyal(supra) and P.N. Menon (supra) to the effect that the decision in the case of D.S. Nakara
(supra) is one of the limited application and there is no scope for enlarging the ambit of that
decision to cover all schemes made by the retirees or a demand for an identical amount of pension
irrespective of the date of retirement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.2 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division
Bench of the High Court, the original writ petitioners All Manipur Pensioners Association
employees/pensioners who retired preLi996 have preferred the present appeal.

 

7. The short question which is posed for consideration before this Court is, whether in the facts and
circumstances of the case, the decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) shall be
applicable or not, and in the facts and circumstances of the case and solely on the ground of
financial constraint, the State Government would be justified in creating two classes of pensioners,
viz., preLi996 retirees and postL4996 retirees for the purpose of payment of revised pension and
whether such a classification is arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution
of India or not?

 

 

7.1 At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the present case, the State Government has
justified the cutLoff date for payment of revised pension solely on the ground of financial constraint.
On no other ground, the State tried to justify the classification. In the backdrop of the aforesaid
facts, the aforesaid question posed for consideration before this Court is required to be considered.

7.2 It is not in dispute that the State Government has adopted the Central Civil Services (Pension)
Rules, to be applicable to the State of Manipur. The State has also come out with the Manipur Civil
Services (Pension) Rules, 1977. It is also not in dispute that subject to completing the qualifying
service the government servants retired in accordance with the pension rules are entitled to pension.
Therefore, as such, all the pensioners form only one homogeneous class. Therefore, it can be said
that all the pensioners form only one class as a whole. Keeping in mind the increase in the cost of
living, the State Government increased the quantum of pension and even pay for its employees. The
State Government also enhanced the scales of pension/quantum of pension with effect from 1.1.1996
keeping in mind the increase in the cost of living. However, the State Government provided the
cutLoff date for the purpose of grant of benefit of revised pension with effect from 1.1.1996 to those
who retired postLi996 and denied the revision in pension to those who retired prel1996. The
aforesaid classification between these pensioners who retired preL1996 and postLi996 for the
purpose of grant of benefit of revision in pension is the subject matter of this appeal. As observed

 

 

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186174315/ 6The All Manipur Pensioners Assn. ... vs The State Of Manipur . on 11 July, 2019

hereinabove, the aforesaid classification is sought to be justified by the State Government solely on
the ground of financial constraint.

7.3 At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the case of D.S.Nakara (supra), such a
classification is held to be arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational and violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. In paragraphs 42 and 65, this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) has
observed and held as under:

42. If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the pensioners for the
purpose of pension benefits form a class, would its upward revision permit a
homogeneous class to be divided by arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated
to purpose of revision, and would such classification be founded on some rational
principle? The classification has to be based, as is well settled, on some rational
principle and the rational principle must have nexus to the objects sought to be
achieved. We have set out the objects underlying the payment of pension. If the State
considered it necessary to liberalise the pension scheme, we find no rational principle
behind it for granting these benefits only to those who retired subsequent to that date
simultaneously denying the same to those who retired prior to that date. If the
liberalisation was considered necessary for augmenting social security in old age to
government servants then those who, retired earlier cannot be worst off than those
who retire later. Therefore, this division which classified pensioners into two classes
is not based on any rational principle and if the rational principle is the one of
dividing pensioners with a view to giving something more to persons otherwise
equally placed, it would be discriminatory. To illustrate, take two persons, one retired
just a day prior and another a day just succeeding the specified date. Both were in the
same pay bracket, the average emolument was the same and both had put in equal
number of years of service. How does a fortuitous circumstance of retiring a day
earlier or a day later will permit totally unequal treatment in the matter of pension?
One retiring a day earlier will have to be subject to ceiling of Rs 8100 p.a. and average
emolument to be worked out on 36 months' salary while the other will have a ceiling
of Rs 12,000 p.a. and average emolument will be computed on the basis of last 10
months' average. The artificial division stares into face and is unrelated to any
principle and whatever principle, if there be any, has absolutely no nexus to the
objects sought to be achieved by liberalising the pension scheme.

In fact this arbitrary division has not only no nexus to the liberalised pension scheme but it is

 

counterL productive and runs counter to the whole gamut of pension scheme. The equal treatment
guaranteed in Article 14 is wholly violated inasmuch as the pension rules being statutory in
character, since the specified date, the rules accord differential and discriminatory treatment to
equals in the matter of commutation of pension. A 48 hours' difference in matter of retirement
would have a traumatic effect. Division is thus both arbitrary and unprincipled. Therefore, the
classification does not stand the test of Article 14.

65. That is the end of the journey. With the expanding horizons of socioLtconomic justice, the
Socialist Republic and welfare State which we endeavour to set up and largely influenced by the fact
that the old men who retired when emoluments were comparatively low and are exposed to vagaries
of continuously rising prices, the falling value of the rupee consequent upon inflationary inputs, we
are satisfied that by introducing an arbitrary eligibility criterion: being in service and retiring
subsequent to the specified date for being eligible for the liberalised pension scheme and thereby
dividing a homogeneous class, the classification being not based on any discernible rational
principle and having been found wholly unrelated to the objects sought to be achieved by grant of
liberalised pension and the eligibility criteria devised being thoroughly arbitrary, we are of the view
that the eligibility for liberalised pension scheme of being in service on the specified date and
retiring subsequent to that date in impugned memoranda, Exs. PO & PL, violates Article 14 and is
unconstitutional and is struck down. Both the memoranda shall be enforced and implemented as
read down as under: In other words, in Ex. PO, the words:

 

 

 

 

 

that in respect of the government servants who were in service on March 31, 1979 and retiring from
service on or after that date and in Ex. PL4, the words:

the new rates of pension are effective from April 1, 1979 and will be applicable to all service officers
who became/become nonLeéffective on or after that date are unconstitutional and are struck down
with this specification that the date mentioned therein will be relevant as being one from which the
liberalised pension scheme becomes operative to all pensioners governed by 1972 Rules irrespective
of the date of retirement. Omitting the unconstitutional part it is declared that all pensioners
governed by the 1972 Rules and Army Pension Regulations shall be entitled to pension as computed
under the liberalised pension scheme from the specified date, irrespective of the date of retirement.
Arrears of pension prior to the specified date as per fresh computation is not admissible. Let a writ
to that effect be issued. But in the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs. 7.4
While the aforesaid decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) was relied upon by the
appellant herein and as such which came to be considered and followed by the learned Single Judge,
the Division Bench considering some of the observations made in the cases of Hari Ram Gupta
(supra); R. Veerasamy (supra); Amar Nath Goyal(supra) and P.N. Menon (supra), has observed and
held that the decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) is one of the limited
application and there is no scope for enlarging the ambit of that decision to cover all schemes made
by the retirees or a demand for an identical amount of pension irrespective of the date of retirement.
However, by not following the decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra), considering
some of the observations made by this Court in the aforesaid decisions, namely P.N.Menon(supra)
and other decisions, the Division Bench of the High Court has not at all considered the
distinguishable facts in the aforesaid decisions.

7.5 In the case of P.N. Menon(supra), the controversy was altogether different one. The factual
position that needs to be highlighted insofar as P.N. Menon (supra) is concerned, is that the retired
employees had never been in receipt of dearness pay when they retired from service and therefore
the O.M. in question could not have been applied to them. This is how this Court examined the
matter. This Court also noticed that prior to the O.M. in question, the pension scheme was
contributory and only with effect from 22.9.1977, the pension scheme was made nonL<contributory.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186174315/ 8The All Manipur Pensioners Assn. ... vs The State Of Manipur . on 11 July, 2019

Since the respondent employees in the first cited case were not in service at the time of introducing
the same they were held not eligible for the said benefit. Therefore, the said decision shall not be
applicable to the facts of the case on hand, more particularly while considering and/or applying the
decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra). 7.6 In the case of Amrit Lal Gandhi (supra),
pension was introduced for the first time for the University teachers based on the resolution passed
by the Senate and Syndicate of Jodhpur University. The same was approved by the State
Government with effect from 1.1.1990. Therefore, the controversy was not between one set of
pensioners alleging discriminatory treatment as against another set of pensioners. There were no
pensioners to begin with. The retirees were entitled to provident fund under the existing provident
fund scheme. The question of discrimination between one set of pensioners from another set of
pensioners did not arise in the said decision. With the aforesaid facts, this Court observed that
financial viability is a relevant issue.

 

 

 

 

7.7 Similarly, the decision of this Court in the case of Indian ExLServices League (supra) also shall
not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. The facts in this case and the facts in the case of
D.S. Nakara (supra) are clearly distinguishable. In the case of Indian Ex Services League (supra),
the dispute was with respect to PF retirees and Pension retirees and to that it was held that PF
retirees and Pension retirees constitute different classes and therefore this Court distinguished the
decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra). Therefore, the aforesaid decision shall not
be applicable to the facts of the case on hand at all. 7.8 Similarly, the decisions of this Court in the
cases of Hari Ram Gupta (supra) and Kallakkurichi Taluk Retired Officials Association, Tamil Nadu
(supra) also shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand.

7.9 In view of the above, we are satisfied that none of the judgments, relied upon by the learned
Senior Advocate for the respondent State, has any bearing to the controversy in hand. The Division
Bench of the High Court has clearly erred in not appreciating and/or considering the distinguishable
facts in the cases of Hari Ram Gupta (supra); R. Veerasamy (supra); Amar Nath Goyal (supra); P.N.
Menon (supra) and Amrit Lal Gandhi (supra).

8. Even otherwise on merits also, we are of the firm opinion that there is no valid justification to
create two classes, viz., one who retired preL1996 and another who retired postli996, for the
purpose of grant of revised pension, In our view, such a classification has no nexus with the object
and purpose of grant of benefit of revised pension. All the pensioners form a one class who are
entitled to pension as per the pension rules. Article 14 of the Constitution of India ensures to all
equality before law and equal protection of laws. At this juncture it is also necessary to examine the
concept of valid classification. A valid classification is truly a valid discrimination. It is true that
Article 16 of the Constitution of India permits a valid classification. However, a very classification
must be based on a just objective. The result to be achieved by the just objective presupposes the
choice of some for differential consideration/treatment over others. A classification to be valid must
necessarily satisfy two tests. Firstly, the distinguishing rationale has to be based on a just objective
and secondly, the choice of differentiating one set of persons from another, must have a reasonable
nexus to the objective sought to be achieved. The test for a valid classification may be summarised as
a distinction based on a classification founded on an intelligible differentia, which has a rational
relationship with the object sought to be achieved. Therefore, whenever a cutLff date (as in the

 

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186174315/ 9The All Manipur Pensioners Assn. ... vs The State Of Manipur . on 11 July, 2019

present controversy) is fixed to categorise one set of pensioners for favourable consideration over
others, the twin test for valid classification or valid discrimination therefore must necessarily be
satisfied. In the present case, the classification in question has no reasonable nexus to the objective
sought to be achieved while revising the pension. As observed hereinabove, the object and purpose
for revising the pension is due to the increase in the cost of living. All the pensioners form a single
class and therefore such a classification for the purpose of grant of revised pension is unreasonable,
arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The State cannot

 

arbitrarily pick and choose from amongst similarly situated persons, a cutLoff date for extension of
benefits especially pensionary benefits. There has to be a classification founded on some rational
principle when similarly situated class is differentiated for grant of any benefit. 8.1 As observed
hereinabove, and even it is not in dispute that as such a decision has been taken by the State
Government to revise the pension keeping in mind the increase in the cost of living. Increase in the
cost of living would affect all the pensioners irrespective of whether they have retired preL1996 or
postLi996. As observed hereinabove, all the pensioners belong to one class. Therefore, by such a
classification/cutLoff date the equals are treated as unequals and therefore such a classification
which has no nexus with the object and purpose of revision of pension is unreasonable,
discriminatory and arbitrary and therefore the said classification was rightly set aside by the learned
Single Judge of the High Court. At this stage, it is required to be observed that whenever a new
benefit is granted and/or new scheme is introduced, it might be possible for the State to provide a

 

 

 

 

cutLoff date taking into consideration its financial resources. But the same shall not be applicable
with respect to one and single class of persons, the benefit to be given to the one class of persons,
who are already otherwise getting the benefits and the question is with respect to revision.

g. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we are of the opinion that the
controversy/issue in the present appeal is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in the case
of D.S. Nakara (supra). The decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) shall be
applicable with full force to the facts of the case on hand. The Division Bench of the High Court has
clearly erred in not following the decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara (supra) and has
clearly erred in reversing the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge. The impugned
judgment and order passed by the Division Bench is not sustainable and the same deserves to be
quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. The judgment and order passed by
the learned Single Judge is hereby restored and it is held that all the pensioners, irrespective of their
date of retirement, viz. pre(1996 retirees shall be entitled to revision in pension at par with those
pensioners who retired postL1996. The arrears be paid to the respective pensioners within a period
of three months from today.

 

 

10. The instant appeal is allowed accordingly. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case,
there shall be no order as to costs.

The question for determination in these appeals was whether
and to what extent the municipal activities of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

Corporation of

943
Nagpur City fell within the term ‘industry' as defined by s.
2 (14. ) of the C.P. and Berar Industrial Disputes
Settlement Act, 1947. Disputes having arisen between the
said Corporation and its employees in its various
departments, the State Government referred them for
adjudication to the State Industrial Court under s. 39 of
the Act and that Court by its award held that the
Corporation and all its departments were covered by the said
definition. Against that award the Corporation made an
application to the High Court under Art. 26
Constitution. The High Court rejected its contention that
the Corporation was not an industry within the meaning of
the said section and remanded the case to the Industrial
Court for determination as to which of its departments fell
within the definition and making an award accordingly.
Thereafter The Industrial Court found all the departments of
the Corporation except those dealing with (1) assessment and
levy of house-tax (2) assessment and levy of Octroi, (3)
removal of encroachment and removal and pulling down of
dilapidated houses, (4) prevention and control of food
adulteration, and (5) maintenance of cattle pounds, to be
industries within the meaning of the definition and passed
its award accordingly. The Corporation appealed to this
Court by special leave but there was no appeal on behalf of
the employees of the five departments excluded from the
definition.
Held, that the decision of the Industrial Court except so
far as it related to the five departments in respect of
which the re was no appeal, must be affirmed.
The definition of the word 'industry' in S. 2 (14) of the
C.P. and Berar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act, 1947,
although in a language somewhat different from that of S. 2
(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is very
comprehensive. It is in two parts, cl. (a) defines it from
the standpoint of employers and cl. (b) from that of the
employee. An activity that falls within any of the two
clauses must be -,in industry.
D.N. Banerji v. P. R. Mukherjee [1953] S.C.R. 302 and Baroda
Borough Municipality v. Its Workmen . [1957] S.C.R.
applied.
It is not necessary that an activity of the Corporation must
share the common characteristics of an industry before it
can come within the section. The words Of S. 2 (14) of the
Act are clear and unambiguous and the maxim noscitur a socii
can have no application. The history of industrial disputes
and the legislation, however, recognises the basic concept
that the activity must be an organised one and not one that
pertains to private or personal employment.

functions cannot be extended so as to include the welfare

1960 Feb. 10. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.-This batch of three
connected appeals raises the question whether and to what extent the activities of the Corporation of
the City of Nagpur come under the definition of "industry" in s. 2(14) of the C.P. & Berar Industrial
Disputes Settlement Act, 1947 (hereinafter called the Act).

The appellant is the Corporation of the City of Nagpur constituted under the City of Nagpur
Corporation Act, 1948 (Madhya Pradesh Act No. 2 of 1950). Disputes arose between the Corporation
and the employees in various departments of the Corporation in respect of wage scales, gratuity,
provident fund, house rent, confirmation, allowances etc. The Government of the State of Madhya
Pradesh by its order dated October 23, 1956, referred the said disputes under s. 39 of the Act to the
State Industrial Court, Nagpur and the reference was numbered as Industrial Reference No. 18 of
1956. The appellant filed a statement before the Industrial Court questioning the jurisdiction of that
Court, inter alia, on the ground that the Corporation was not an industry as defined by the Act. On
February 13, 1957, the Industrial Court made a preliminary order holding that the Corporation was
an industry and that the further question whether any department of the Corporation was an
industry or not, would be decided on the evidence. The appellant challenged the correctness of that
order by filing a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Bombay at Nagpur,
but that petition was dismissed, as the award was made before its hearing. On June 3, 1957, the
Industrial Court made an award holding that the Corporation was an industry and further that all
departments of the Corporation were covered by the said definition. It also revised the pay scales of
the employees and accepted the major demands made by them. On July 15, 1957, the appellant again
filed a petition in the High Court of Bombay at Nagpur, questioning the validity and the, correctness
of the aid award. A division bench of the said High Court, by its order dated September 11, 1957,
rejected the contention of the appellant that the, Corporation was not an industry as defined by the
Act and remanded the case to the State Industrial Court to decide the activities of which
departments of the Corporation fell within the definition of "industry" given in the Act and to
re-examine the schedules and categories of persons and to restrict the award to the persons
concerned within the definition of the word "industry" in the Act. On remand, the said Industrial
Court scrutinized the activities of each of the departments of the Corporation and hold that all the
departments of the Corporation, except those dealing with (i) assessment and levy of house-tax, (ii)
assessment and levy and pulling down of dilapidated houses, (iv) prevention and control of food
adulteration and (v) maintenance of cattle pounds, were covered by the definition of "industry"

under the Act. It further gave findings in regard to the disputes between be parties and also as to the
persons entitled to the reliefs. It is not necessary to give the particular-. of the findings arrived at or
the relief given by the Industrial Court, as nothing turns upon them in this appeal. The appellant by
special leave filed in this Court Civil Appeal No. 143 of 1959 against the award of the Industrial
Court. It also filed in this Court by special leave Civil Appeal No. 144 of 1959 against the order of the
High Court holding that the activities of the Corporation came under the definition of "industry" in
the Act and remanding the case to the Industrial Court for decision on merits in respect of each of
the activities of the Corporation.

Civil Appeal No. 545 of 1958, the third appeal in this batch, arises out of a reference made by the
State Government of Madhya Pradesh in regard to the disputes between the appellant, i.e. the
Corporation of the City of Nagpur, and the employees of the Corporation in the Fire ]Brigade
Department, representing themselves and other employees. The said reference was numbered as
Industrial of 1957. As there was overlapping of the disputes raised in Industrial Reference No. 18 of
1956 and Industrial Reference No. 1 of 1957, the Industrial Court heard both the references together
and, by consent, the evidence in Reference No. 18 of 1956 was treated as evidence in Reference No. 1
of 1957. On December 14, 1957, an award was made in Reference No. 1 of 1957 and it was based on
the findings in the award made in Reference No. 18 of 1956. The Industrial Court held that the Fire
Brigade ]Department was an industry within the meaning of the Act and, on that basis, gave the
necessary reliefs to the employees. Mr. Aggarwala, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in
the first two appeals, raised before us the following points: (1) No service rendered by the
Corporation would be an industry as defined by s. 2(14) of the Act. (2) Assuming that some of the
services of the Corporation are comprehended by the definition of " industry " in the Act, the said
services, in order to satisfy the definition, must 'be analogous to a business or trade. (3) Even
otherwise, the activities of the Corporation to be called industry must partake the common
characteristics of an industry. (4) The, finding of the Industrial Court holding that the various
departments of the Corporation are industries is not correct, as the services rendered by the said
departments do not satisfy either of the aforesaid two tests. The first question need not detain us, for
it has now been finally decided by two decisions of this Court against the appellant. In D. N. Banerji
v. P. R. Mukherjee (1), the chairman of a municipality dismissed two of its employees, namely, the
Sanitary Inspector and the Head Clerk, and the Municipal Workers' Union questioned the propriety
of the dismissal and claimed that they should be reinstated and the matter was referred by the
Government to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication under the Industrial Disputes Act. In that
case two questions were raised before this Court-one was whether the said dispute was industrial
dispute within the meaning of s. 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act and the other was whether the
Industrial Disputes Act was invalid inasmuch as it allowed the Tribunal to reinstate employees and
to that extent trenched on the power of the chairman to appoint and dismiss employees. This Court
held that the Act was not invalid, as it was in pith and substance a law in respect of industrial and
labour disputes and that the conservancy service rendered by the municipality was an industry and
the dispute between the municipality and the employees of the conservancy department was an
industrial dispute within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act. This decision was followed by
this Court in Baroda Borough Municipality v. Its Workmen (1). In that case the effect of the earlier
decision was summarized thus, at p. 38:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 5The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

"It is now finally settled by the decision of this Court in D. N. Banerji v. P. R. Mukherjee (2) that a
municipal undertaking of the nature we have under consideration here is an " industry " within the
meaning of the definition of that word in s. 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and that the
expression " industrial dispute " in that Act includes disputes between municipalities and their
employees in branches of work that can be regarded as analogous to the carrying on of a trade or
business."

In that case the workmen employed in the electricity department of the Baroda Municipality
demanded bonus. The electricity undertaking of the Baroda Municipality was held to be an industry
and the dispute between the Municipality and its employees an industrial dispute. Bonus was
refused on other grounds and we are not concerned with that aspect of the case here. These two
cases, therefore, have finally and authoritatively held that municipal undertakings could be "
industry " within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act.

A faint argument is attempted to sustain a distinction between the definition of an "industry" in the
Industrial Disputes Act and the definition of the same word in the Act in question. Section 2(j) of the

(2) [1957] S.C.R. 33.

(2) [1953] S.C.R. 302 Industrial Disputes Act defines " industry " to mean any business, trade,
undertaking, manufacture or calling of employers and to include any calling service, employment,
handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen ". Section 2(14) of the Act divides the
definition into three parts, namely, " (a) any business, trade, manufacturing or mining undertaking
or calling of employers,

(b) any calling, service, employment, handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of employees,
and (c) any branch of an industry or a group of industries." A comparative study of these two
sections brings out the following differences: While the definition of " industry " in the Industrial
Disputes Act means certain things and includes others, the definition of " industry " in the Act
includes the three categories described therein; while the definition in the former Act places
‘undertaking’ in a category different from ' manufacturing or mining ', in the latter Act it is qualified
by the words 'manufacturing or mining’. In our view these differences do not justify us in taking a
different view from that accepted by this Court in the foregoing decisions. Clause (a) of the
definition defines industry with reference to the employers and cl. (b) with reference to the
employees. Excluding the words "manufacturing or mining undertaking " from cl. (a) of the
definition, the other words in cls. (a) and (b) thereof are comprehensive enough to take in all the
categories which the definition of "industry" in the Industrial Disputes Act will take in. That apart, a
perusal of the decision of this Court in D. N. Banerji v. P. R. Mukherjee (1) does not indicate that this
Court would have come to a different conclusion if the word " undertaking " in the Industrial
Disputes Act was qualified by the words " manufacturing or mining ". The decision was founded on a
broader basis, having regard to the history of the legislation, the cognate definitions in the Act and
the inclusive part of the definition corresponding to s. 2(14)(b) of the Act. We, therefore, hold that a
service rendered by a corporation, if it complies with the conditions implicit in the definition- which
we would consider at a later stage (1) [1953] S.C.R. 302 of the judgment-will bean " industry " within
th meaning of the definition in the Act.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 6The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

The next question is whether activity of the Corporation is not " industry " unless it shares the
common characteristics of an industry. The following five characteristics are stated to be the
conditions implicit in the definition: (i) the activity must concern the production or distribution of
good or services; (ii) it must be to serve others but not to oneself; (iii) it must involve co- operative
effort between employer and employer between capital an labour; (iv) it must be done as a
commercial transaction and (v) it must not be in exercise of pure governmental functions.

We have considered this aspect in State of Bombay v. The Hospital Maazdoor Sabha (1) in the
context of the definition of " industry " in the Industrial Disputes Act and formulated certain broad
principles. But as this case is concerned with the definition of "industry" in a different Act, we shall
briefly resurvey the law on the subject with specific reference to a corporation.

Let us scrutinize the definition of " industry " to ascertain whether all or some of the conditions are
implicit in the definition and whether the said conditions constitute the necessary basis for it. The
true meaning of the section must be gathered from the expressed intention of the Legislature.
Maxwell in his book "On the Interpretation of Statutes", 10th Edn., rightly points out at p. 2 that " If
the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous no more is necessary than to
expound those, words in their natural and ordinary sense, the words themselves in such case best
declaring the intention of the legislature ". The words used in the section are clear and unambiguous
and they prima facie are of the widest import. We have pointed out that the section is in two parts:
cl.

(a) defines " industry " with reference to employers and cl.
(b) defines it with reference to employees. Clause

(c) extends the definition to any branch of an industry or a group of industries, i.e., industries
Coming within the definition of cls. (a) and (b). It is said that in (1)[1960] 2 S.C.R. 866.

construing the definition we must adopt the rule of construction noscuntur a sociis. Maxwell
explains this doctrine at p. 332 thus:

" When two or more words which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled together
noscuntur a sociis. They are understood to be used in their cognate sense. They take, as it were, their
colour from each other, that is, the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to the less
general." On the basis of this doctrine, it is argued that the words following the words " any
business, trade, manufacturing or mining undertaking " shall partake the characteristics of any
business, trade, manufacturing or mining undertaking, and the words " any calling, service,
employment, handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of employees " shall share the
qualities of an industrial occupation or avocation. In other words, the general word " calling " in cl.
(a) is controlled by the words preceding it, and the general words " calling, service etc." in cl.

(b) are restricted by the succeeding words " industrial occupation or avocation ". This doctrine was
dealt with by this Court in State of Bombay v. The Hospital Mazdoor Sabha (1). Therein this Court

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 7The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

has considered the scope of this doctrine and has observed thus:

"It must be borne in mind that noscuntur a sociis is merely a rule of construction and it cannot
prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make
the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider. It is only where the intention of the
Legislature in associating wider words with words of narrower significance is doubtful that the
present rule of construction can be usefully applied. It can also be applied where the meaning of the
words of wider import is doubtful; but where the object of the Legislature in using wider words is
clear and free of ambiguity, the rule of construction in question cannot be pressed into service. The
said doctrine, therefore, cannot be invoked in cases where the intention of the Legislature is clear
and free of ambiguity. The phraseology used in the (1) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 866 section is very clear and it
is not susceptible of any ambiguity. The words used in the first part of cl. (b) are unqualified; and the
qualification is introduced only in the later part. If the words " calling, service, employment,
handicraft " are really intended to be qualified by the adjective " industrial ", one should expect the
Legislature to affix the adjective to the first word " calling " rather than to the last word "
occupations." The inclusive definition is a wellrecognized device to enlarge the meaning of the word
defined, and, therefore, the word , "industry " must be construed as comprehending not only such
things as it signifies according to its natural import but also those things the definition declares that
it should include: see Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, Vol. 2, p. 1416. So construed, every calling,
service, employment of an employee or any business, trade or calling of an employer will be an
industry. But such a wide meaning appears to overreach the objects for which the Act was passed. It
is, therefore, necessary to limit its scope on permissible grounds , having regard to the aim, scope
and the object of the whole Act. To arrive at the real meaning of the words, Lord Coke in Heydon's
case, (1) says that the following matters are to be considered: (1) What was the law before the Act
was passed ; (2) What was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided; (3) What
remedy Parliament hap, appointed; and (4) The reason of the, remedy. The word " employers " in el.
(a) and the word " employees " in cl.

(b) indicate that the fundamental basis for the application of the definition is the existence of that
relationship. The cognate definitions of "industrial dispute", "employer", " employee ", also support
it. The long title of the Act as well as its preamble show that the Act was passed to make provision
for the promotion of industries and peaceful and amicable settlement of disputes between
employers and employees in an organized activity by conciliation and arbitration and for certain
other purposes. If the preamble is read with the historical background for the passing of the Act, it is

manifest that the Act was introduced as an (1)[1584] 3 Rep. 7b.

important step in achieving social justice. The Act seeks to ameliorate the service conditions of the
workers, to provide a machinery for resolving their conflicts and to encourage co-operative effort in
the service of the community. The history of labour legislation both in England and India also shows
that it was aimed more to ameliorate the conditions of service of the labour in organized activities
than to anything else. The Act was not intended to reach the personal services which do not depend
upon the employment of a labour force. Before considering the positive aspects of the definition,
what is not an industry may be considered. However wide the definition of " industry " may be, it
cannot include the regal or sovereign functions of State. This is the agreed basis of the arguments at

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 8The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

the Bar, though the learned counsel differed on the ambit of such functions. While the learned
counsel for the Corporation would like to enlarge the scope of these functions so as to comprehend
all the welfare activities of a modern State, the learned counsel for the respondents would seek to
confine them to what are aptly termed " the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional
government ". It is said that in a modern State the sovereign power extends to all the statutory
functions of the State except to the business of trading and industrial transactions undertaken by it
in its quasi- private personality. Sustenance for this contention is sought to be drawn from Holland's
Jurisprudence, wherein the learned author divides the general heading "Public Law " into four
sab-heads and under the sub-head "Administrative Law " he deals with a variety of topics including
welfare and social activities of a State. The treatment of the subject " Public Law" by Holland and
other authors, in our view, has no relevancy in appreciating the scope of the concept of regal
powers-which have acquired a definite connotation. Lord Watson, in Coomber v. Justices of Berks
(1), describes the functions such as administration of justice, maintenance of order and repression of
crime, as among the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional Govern
(1)(4883-84) 9 App. Cas, 61, 74 ment. Isaacs, J., in his dissenting judgment in The Federated State
School Teachers' Association of the Australia v. The State of Victoria (1), concisely states thus at p.
585 
Regal functions are inescapable and inalienable. Such are the legislative power, the administration
of laws, the exercise of the judicial power. Non-regal functions may be assumed by means of the
legislative power. But when they are assumed the State .acts simply as a huge corporation, with its
legislation as the charter. Its action under the legislation, so far as it is not regal execution of the law
is merely analogous to that of a private company similarly authorised. "

These words clearly mark out the ambit of the regal functions as distinguished from the other
powers of a State. It could not have been, therefore, in the contemplation of the Legislature to bring
in the regal functions of the State within the definition of industry and thus confer jurisdiction on
Industrial Courts to decide disputes in respect thereof. We, therefore, exclude the regal functions of
a State from the definition of industry. This leads us to the question whether the Corporation can be
said to exercise regal functions by legislative delegation. The Corporation functions under a statute
and its powers, duties and liabilities are regulated by it. It is a juristic person and it can sue and be
sued in its name. The statute constituting it may confer upon it some strictly regal functions and
other municipal functions. In County Council of Middlesex v. Assessment Committee of St. George's
Union (2), certain premises were used for the administration of justice and also for municipal
purposes. The question raised was whether the said premises were rateable and the Court held that
they were rateable in so far as they were occupied for municipal purposes and not rateable in so
fares they were occupied for the administration of justice, which was held to be a function of the
Crown. So too, the Supreme Court of America in Verisimo Vasquez Vilas (1) (1929) 41 C.L.R. 569.

(2) (1896) 2 Q.B.D. 143.

v. City of Manila (1) expounded the dual character of a municipal corporation thus:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 9The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

" They exercise powers which are governmental and powers which are of a private or business
character. In the one character a municipal corporation is a governmental sub- division, and for that
purpose exercises by delegation a part of the sovereignty of the State. In the other character it is a
mere legal entity or juristic person. In the latter character it stands for the community in the
administration of local affairs wholly beyond the sphere of the public purposes for which its
governmental powers are conferred. "

Isaacs and Rich, JJ., in The Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v.
Melbourne Corporation (2) in the context of the dual functions of State say much to the same effect
at p. 530:

" Here we have the discrimen of Crown exemption. If a municipality either (1) is legally empowered
to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown., or (2) is lawfully empowered to
perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function-as,
for instance, the administration of justice the municipality is in law presumed to represent the
Crown, and the exemption applies. Otherwise, it is outside that exemption, and, if impliedly
exempted at all, some other principle must be resorted to. The making and maintenance of streets in
the municipality is not within either proposition." A corporation may, therefore, discharge a dual
function : it may be statutorily entrusted with regal functions strictly so-called, such as making of
laws, disposal of certain cases judicially etc., and also with other welfare activities. The former, being
delegated regal functions, must be excluded from the ambit of the definition of "industry". The next
head of exclusion from the definition is put by the learned counsel for the appellant thus : A
municipality in the modern polity is also a trading (1) 220 U.S. 345. 356; 55 L. Ed. 491, 495.

(2) (1918-19),26 C.L.R. 508, 530-531.

and industrial corporation and in that capacity is empowered to carry on undertakings partaking the
Character of business and trade, and that the definition of "industry" in the Act only takes in such
undertakings and no other statutory activities. To state it differently, the contention is that activities
which partake the character of trade and business in the hands of a private individual would be an
industry if undertaken by a corporation. Some observations made by this Court in D. N. Banerji v. P.
R. Mukherjee (1) are relied upon in support of this contention. Chandrasekbara Aiyar, J., speaking
for the Court made the following observations at p. 317:

"Having regard to the definitions found in our Act, the aim or objective that the Legislature had in
view and the nature, variety and range of disputes that occur between employees and employees, we
are forced to the conclusion that the definitions in our Act include also disputes that might arise
between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be said to be analogous to
the carrying out of a trade or business."

Emphasis is laid upon the words " analogous to the carrying out of a trade or business" and an
argument is built upon those words to the effect that this Court held that only such activities of
municipalities analogous to trade or business would be industry within the meaning of the definition
of "industry" in the Act. This argument, if we may say so, is the result of an incorrect reading of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 10The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

decision. There the question was whether the sanitary department of a municipality was an industry
within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act and whether the dispute between the municipality
and its employees in that department was an industrial dispute thereunder. At p. 311, the learned
Judge specifically deals with a contention based upon the collocation of the words in the section and
observes :

"Though the word "undertaking" in the definition of "industry" is wedged in between business and
trade on the one hand and manufacture on the other, and though therefore it might mean only a
business or trade undertaking, still it must be (1) [1953] S.C.R. 302 remembered that if that were so,
there wag no need to use the word separately from business or trade. The wider import is attracted
even more clearly when we look at the latter part of the definition which refers to "calling, service,
employment, or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen." "Undertaking" in the first part of
the definition and "industrial occupation. or avocation" in the second part obviously mean much
more than what is ordinarily understood by trade or business. The definition was
apparently-intended to include within its scope what might Dot strictly be called a trade or business
venture." This passage leaves no room for doubt that this Court construed the terms of the definition
of "industry" in a way which takes in activities which are not strictly called trade or business.
Therefore the words "not strictly be called a trade or business venture" and the words "analogous to
the carrying out, of a trade or business" emphasize more the nature of the organised activity implicit
in a trade or business than to equate the other activities with trade or business. This is made more
clear by the learned Judge when be expressly reserves the Court's opinion on a wider question in the
following words at p. 318:

"It is unnecessary to decide whether disputes arising in relation to purely administrative work fall
within their ambit."

We cannot, therefore, agree with the contention that the said decision, when it expressly accepted
the comprehensive meaning which the words of the section naturally bear, intended to circumscribe
the wide sweep of the section to business or trade and activities in the nature of trade or business.
Nor a fair reading of the section bears out such a construction. We have already indicated our view
on the construction of the section, having regard to the clear phraseology used therein, that the
section cannot be confined to trade or business or activities analogous to trade or business.

Amore workable and reasonable test is laid down in an Australian decision cited at the Bar, and that
test has also been accepted and applied by this Court. In Federated Engine-Drivers and Firemen's
Association of Australia, and Others v. The Broken. Hill Proprietory Company Limited and Others
(1) a distinction was drawn between trading and non-trading operations, but the question as to how
far non-trading operations attracted the definition of "industry" was left undecided. That question
fell to be decided in The Municipal and Shire Council Employees’ Union of Australia v. Melboure
Corporation (2 ) and that decision, if we may say so, is illuminating and throws considerable light on
the question to be decided in the present appeal. It was held by the High Court of Australia that the
Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration had authority to determine by award a dispute
between an organization of employees registered in connection with "municipal and shire councils,
municipal trusts and similar industries", and municipal corporations constituted under State laws.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 11The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

The dispute there related to those operations of municipal corporations which consisted of the
making, maintenance, control and lighting of public streets. The learned Judges discussed at length
the meaning of the word "industrial dispute" in s. 51 (XXXV) ofthe Constitution of Australia. It is
manifest from this decision that even activities of a municipality which cannot be described as
trading activities can be the subject-matter of an industrial dispute. Isaacs, J.,in his dissenting
judgment in The Federated State School Teachers’ Association of Australia v. The State of Victoria
(3), has concisely expressed this idea at p. 587 thus:

"The material question is: What is the nature of the actual function assumed is it a service that the
State could have left to private enterprise, and, if so fulfilled, could such a depute be "industrial" ?"
This test steers clear of the argument that to be an industry the activity shall be a trading activity. If
a service performed by an individual is an industry, it will continue to be so notwithstanding the fact
that it is undertaken by a corporation. Another test suggested by the learned counsel may be
scrutinized. It is said that unless there is a (1) (1913) 16 C.L.R. 245. (2) (1918-19) 26 C.L.R. 508, 530
(3) (1929) 41 C.L.R. 569 quid pro quo for the service, it cannot be an industry. This is the same
argument, namely, that the service must be in

-the nature of trade in a different garb. This Court in D. N. Banerji v. P. B. Mukherjee (1) has held
that neither the investment of capital or the existence of profitearning motive seems to beta sine qua
non or necessary element in the modern conception of industry. The conception that unless the
public who are benefited by the services pay in cash for the services rendered to them, the services
so rendered cannot be industry is based upon an exploded theory. As observed by Chandrasekhara
Aiyar, J., "the conflicts between capital and labour have now to be determined more from the
standpoint of status than of contract". Isaac and Rich, JJ., in The Fede rated Municipal and Shire
Council Employees’ Union of Australia v. Melbourne Corporation (2) formulated the modern
concept of industry at p. 554 thus:

" Industrial disputes occur when, in relation to operations in which capital and labour are
contributed in co-operation for the satisfaction of human wants or desires, those engaged in
co-operation dispute as to the basis to be observed, by the parties engaged, respecting either a share
of the product or any other terms and conditions of their cooperation.

The learned Judges proceeded to state at p. 564: " The question of profit-making maybe important
from an income tax point of view, as in many municipal cases in England; but, from an industrial
dispute point of view, it cannot matter whether the expenditure is met by fares from passengers or
from rates. In each case the 'municipality is performing a function; and in the one case it performs it
with a variation in contrast with the other. Isaac, J., elaborated the theme in his dissenting judgment
in The Federated State School Teachers’ Association of Australia v. The State of Victoria (3) at p. 577
thus: " The contention sounds like an echo from the dark ages of industry and political
ECONOMY... Such disputes are not simply a claim to share (1) [1953] S.C.R. 302 (2) [1918-19]
26 C.L.R. 508, 539-531. 122 (3) [1929] 41 C.L.R. 569.

the material wealth jointly produced and capable of registration in statistics. At heart they are a
struggle, constantly becoming more intense on the part of the employed group engaged in
co-operation with the employing group in rendering services to the community essential for a higher
general human welfare, to share in that welfare in a greater degree. All industrial enterprises
contribute more or less to the general welfare of the community, and this is a most material
consideration when we come to determine the present question apart from the particular contention
raised at the Bar.

Monetary considerations for service is, therefore, not an essential characteristic of industry in a
modern State. The learned counsel then sought to demarcate the activities of a municipality into
three categories, namely, (i) the activities of the department which performs the services;

(ii) those of the department which only impose taxes, collect them and administer them; and (iii)
those of the departments which are purely in administrative charge of other departments. We do not
see any justification for this artificial division of municipal activities. Barring the regal functions of a
municipality, if such other activities of it, if undertaken by an individual, would be industry; then
they would equally be industry in the hands of a municipality. It would be unrealistic to draw a line
between a department doing a service and a department controlling or feeding it. Supervision and
actual ,performance of service are integral part of the same activity. In other words, whether these
three functions are carried out by one department or divided between three departments, the entire
organizational activity would be an industry. This aspect of the question was incidentally touched
upon by this Court in Baroda Borough Municipality v. Its Workmen and the following passage at p.
49 reads thus: " We have already pointed out that under the Municipal Act a municipality may
perform various functions, some obligatory and some discretional. The activities may be of a
composite nature,: some (1) [1957] S.C.R. 33 of the departments may be mostly earning
departments and some mostly spending departments. For example, the department which collects
municipal taxes or other municipal revenue, is essentially an earning department whereas the
sanitary department or other service department is essentially a spending department. There may
indeed be departments where the earning and spending may almost balance each other."

We have extracted this passage only because the observations are apposite to the discussion on hand
but not to express our concurrence with the conclusion drawn in that case. The question of bonus
does not fall to be considered in the present appeal. These observations and support to our view that
integrated activities of a municipality cannot be separated to take in some under the definition of "

industry " and exclude others from it.

We can also visualize different situations. A particular activity of a municipality may be covered by
the definition of "industry". If the financial and administrative departments are solely in charge of
that activity, there can be no difficulty in treating those two departments also as part of the industry.
But there may be cases where the said two departments may not only be in charge of a particular
activity or service covered by the definition of "industry" but also in charge of other activity or
activities falling outside the definition of "industry".In such cases a working rule may be evolved to
advance social justice consistent with the principles of equity. In such cases the solution to the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 13The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

problem depends upon the answer to the question whether such a department is primarily and
predominantly concerned with industrial activity or incidentally connected therewith.

The result of the discussion may be summarized thus: (1) The definition of " industry " in the Act is
very comprehensive, It is in two parts: one part defines it from the standpoint of the employer and
the other from the standpoint of the employee. If an activity falls under either part of the definition,
it will be an industry within the meaning of the Act.

(2) The history of industrial disputes and the legisla- tion recognizes the basic concept that the
activity shall be an organized one and not that which pertains to private or personal employment.
(3) The regal functions described as primary and inalienable functions of State though statutorily
delegated to corporation are necessarily excluded from the purview of the definition. Such regal
functions shall be confined to legislative power, administration of law and judicial power. (4) Ifa
service rendered by an individual or a private person would be an industry, it would equally be an
industry in the hands of a corporation. (5) If a service rendered by a corporation is an industry, the
employees in the departments connected with that service, whether financial administrative or
executive, would be entitled to the benefits of the Act. (6) If a department of a municipality
discharges many functions, some pertaining to industry as defined in the Act and other nonindustrial activities, the predominant functions of the department shall be the criterion for the
purposes of the Act.

The following are the various departments of the Nagpur City Corporation: (1) General
Administration Department; (2) Octroi Department; (3) Tax Department; (4) Public Conveyance
Department; (5) Fire Brigade Department; (6) Lighting Department; (7) Water Works Department;
(8) City Engineer Department; (9) Enforcement (encroachment) Department: (10) Sewage Pumping
Station Department; (11) Sewage Farm Department; (12) Health Department; (13) Market
Department; (14) Cattle Pound Department; (15) Public Gardens Depart- ment; (16) Public Works
Department; (17) Assessment Department; (18) Estate Department; (19) Education Department;
(20) Printing Press Department; (21) Workshop Department; and (22) Building Department. Out of
these departments, the State Industrial Court has held that all the departments except those
pertaining to (i) assessment and levy of house-tax, (ii) assessment and levy of octroi,

(iii) removal of encroachment and pulling down of dilapidated houses, (iv) maintenance of cattle
pounds, and (v) prevention and control of food adulteration, are industries. Even in regard to the
departments which the State Industrial Tribunal held to be industries it denied relief to persons who
are not covered by the definition of " employees " in the Act. As the employees have not preferred
any appeal against the award in so far as it went against them, nothing further need be said in
regard to the aforesaid five departments.

Before we consider whether all or any of the departments of the Corporation fall within the
definition of " industry " in the Act, it will be convenient to notice the scheme of the City of Nagpur
Corporation Act, 1948 (Madhya Pradesh Act No. 2 of 1950). Section 7 makes the Corporation a body
corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. Section 6 describes the municipal
authorities charged with the execution of the Act and they are: (a) the Corporation;

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 14The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

(b) the Standing Committee; and (c) the Chief Executive Officer. Chapter II of Part II contains the
aforesaid sections and it further provides for the constitution of the Corporation and the mode of
election to the said body. Chapter III of the said Part prescribes the procedure for the conduct of
business of the Corporation. Chapter IV thereof provides for the appointment of municipal officers
and servants and for their punishment and removal. Chapter V deals with powers, duties and
functions of the municipal authorities; it gives the obligatory and discretionary duties of the
Corporation. Under s. 57, the Corporation shall make adequate provision, by any means or measures
which it may lawfully use or take, such as for lighting public streets, cleaning of public
streets,disposal of nightsoil and rubbish, maintenance of firebrigade and other welfare activities in
the interest of the public. Section 58 confers a discretionary power on the Corporation to provide for
other amenities not covered by s. 57, and which are comparatively not absolutely essential but are
necessary for the happiness of the people of the State. Provisions of Ch. VI enable the municipality
to hold and acquire properties, to manage public institutions maintained out of municipal funds.
Section 79 enjoins on the municipality to apply the fund available with it to discharge its statutory
duties and pay salaries and allowances of its various servants. Chapter IX enables the municipality
to raise loans on the security of its properties for discharging debts and for meeting the capital
expenditure. Part IV empowers the municipality to impose taxes for the purposes of this Act and
also describes the procedure for collecting the same. Part V confers powers and imposes duties on
the Corporation and its officers in respect of public health, safety and convenience. This Part deals
with public convenience, drains and privies, conservancy, sanitary provisions, water supply and
drainage, regulation of factories and trades, markets and slaughter places, food, drink, drug and
dangerous articles, prevention of infectious diseases and disposal of the dead. Part VI empowers the
Corporation to draw up townplanning schemes, to regulate erection and re-erection of buildings, to
close public streets, to remove obstruction in streets, to regulate laying of new streets, to dispose of
mad and stray dogs, to control public begging, to prohibit brothels etc. Part VIII lays down the
general provisions for carrying on the municipal administration and also enabling the Corporation
to make by-laws for carrying out the provisions and intentions of the Act. Shortly stated, the Act
creates the Corporation a juristic person capable of holding and disposing of property, confers
power on it to impose and collect taxes and licence fees, to borrow money, to decide disputes in the
first instance in respect thereof, constitutes the amounts so collected as the fund of the municipality
from and out of which the liabilities of the Corporation are met and the salaries of its employees are
paid, imposed on it duties to carry out various welfare activities in the interest of the public, confers
on it powers for, implementing their duties satisfactorily and also powers to make by-laws for
regulating its various functions. In short, a corporation is analogous to a big public company
carrying out most of the duties which such a company can undertake to do with the difference that
certain statutory powers have been conferred on the corporation for carrying out its functions more
satisfactorily.

With this background let us take each of the departments of the Corporation held by the State
Industrial Court to be governed by the Act.

(i) Tax Department: The main functions of this department are the imposition and collection of
conservancy, water and property taxes. No separate staff has been employed for the assessment and

levy of property taxes: the same staff does the work connected with assessment and collection of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 15The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

water rates as well as scavenging taxes. It is not disputed that the work of assessment and levy of
water rate and scavenging rate for private latrines is far heavier than the other works entrusted to
this department. No attempt has been made to allocate specific proportion of the staff for different
functions. We, therefore, must accept the finding of the State Industrial Court that the staff of this
department doing clerical or manual work predominantly does the work connected with scavening
taxes and water rate. The said rates are really intended as fees for the service rendered. The services,
namely, scavenging and supply of water, can equally be undertaken by a private firm or an
individual for remuneration and the fact that the munici- pality does the same duty does not make it
any the less a service coming under the definition of "industry". We would, however, prefer to
sustain the finding on a broader basis. There cannot be a distinction between property tax and other
taxes collected by the municipality for the purpose of designating the tax department as an industry
or otherwise. The scheme of the Corporation Act is that taxes and fees are collected in order to
enable the municipality to discharge its statutory functions. If the functions so discharged are wholly
or predominantly covered by the definition of " industry ", it would be illogical to exclude the tax
department from the definition. While in the case of private individuals or firms services are paid in
cash or otherwise, in the case of public institutions, as the services are rendered to the public, the
taxes collected from them constitute a fund for performing those services. As most of the services
rendered by the municipality come under the definition of industry ", we should hold that the
employees of the tax department are also entitled to the benefits under the Act.

(ii) Public Conveyance Department: This is a tax which is a wheel-cum-road tax. Conveyance
department is meant to regulate the using of cycles, rickshaws, bullock-carts etc. This department
recovers registration fees for rickshaws, licence fee from rickshaw drivers and wheel tax from
bullock-carts. It also recovers cycle tax on every cycle used in Corporation limits. (See the evidence
of Witness No 1 for Party No. 1). These taxes are therefore really fees collected by the Corporation
for the services rendered to the owners of cycles and other conveyances by way of maintenance and
construction of roads. These services can equally be performed by a private individual or a firm for
remuneration. It satisfies the tests laid down by us. This department, therefore, is 'an industry
within the meaning of the definition in the Act.

(iii) Fire Brigade Department: Ex. N. A. 22 gives the duties of the driver-cum-fitter of the Fire
Brigade Department. This exhibit indicates that the function of this department is to attend to fire
calls. Witness No. 3 for Party No. 1 says that it is the duty of the firebrigade to supply water at
marriage functions and other public functions. The firebrigade employees are not paid any extra
amount for supplying water at public or private functions. Though the department renders some
extra services, the main function of the department is to attend to " fire calls". Private bodies also
can undertake this service. It is said that under s. 333 of the City of Nagpur Corporation Act powers
are conferred on specified officers to remove or order the removal of any person who interferes with
or impedes the operation for extinguishing the fire, to close any street or passage in or near which
any fire is burning, to break into or pull down or use for the passage of hoses or other appliances,
any premises for the purpose of extinguishing the fire and generally to take such measures as may
appear necessary for the preservation of life or property, and that the services of the firebrigade
cannot be satisfactorily rendered without such powers and that no private individual can perform
the same. Here 'the argument tends to be fallacious as it ignores the distinction between he services

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 16The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

and the statutory powers conferred to satisfactorily discharge the said services. A private person or a
firm can equally do the same services and nothing prevents the legislature from conferring similar
powers on an individual or a firm. These services also satisfy all the tests laid down by us and
therefore we hold that this department is also an industry.

(iv) Lighting Department: Lighting Department looks after the arrangements for lighting the streets
in the Corporation area. There are two systems of lighting streets, namely, (1) by electricity, and (2)
by kerosene oil lamps. Electric street lighting is given on contract to Nagpur Light and Power Co.,
Nagpur, by the Corporation. Kerosene oil street lighting is done departmentally by the lighting
department. Electric Light and Power Co., is responsible to the Corporation for street lighting. The
said Company has to fix electric lights according to the programme given to it by the Corporation.
The burning hours are also fixed by the Corporation. The Corporation does not charge the public for
street lighting. (See the evidence of Witness No. 5 for Party No. 1). We have already indicated that
quid pro coin the shape of payment of money for particular services rendered is not a necessary
condition for the application of the definition of "industry ". The services rendered by the
department satisfy the terms of the definition. They also satisfy both the positive and negative tests
laid down by us. We, therefore, hold that this department is an indus- try.

(v) Water Works Department: This department maintains three head-works, Kanhan, Gorewara,
and Ambazeri. There are pumping stations at Kanhan and Gorewara. At the pumping stations the
water is filtered and pumped into service reservoir at Nagpur. The Corporation has a separate staff
at each pumping station. It has also a separate staff for distribution. In addition it maintains an
assessment. department to assess water cess for the distribution of water. (See the evidence of
Witness No. 9 for Party No. 1). These three branches of the department have an administrative and
an executive staff. Whether the services rendered by the department are concerned With
manufacturing process or not, they are certainly covered by the wide definition of " industry" in the
Act. They also satisfy both the positive and negative tests laid down by us. None of them comprises
delegated regal functions of State and they are such that a private individual can equally undertake
to do. We, therefore hold that the said department comes under the definition of "industry".

(vi) City Engineers Department: The function of this department is to exercise supervisory an administrative control over, its subordinate departments. The City Engineer is the head of this
department. (See the evidence of Witness No. 5 for Party No. 1). As we are of the view that the
departments subordinate to this department come under the definition of "industry", this
department, which has administrative control Over those subordinate departments, must be
considered a part of those departments. If so, it follows that this department is also an industry.

(vii) Enforcement (encroachment) Department: The function of this department is to remove
encroachment and unauthorised constructions and dilapidated houses. This department is a section
of the Estate Department. (See the evidence of Witness No. 5 for Party No. 1). It is contended that
the functions of this department are all statutory and that no private individual can perform them.
Statutory powers are conferred on the Corporation to remove encroachment and unauthorised
construction and dilapidated houses. These powers are necessary for the Corporation to protect its
properties and to prevent encroachment thereon and to remove dilapidated houses in the interest of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 17The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

the public. But if a distinction is made between the powers and the nature of the services rendered,
it would be obvious that the services rendered are not peculiar to a corporation. A private firm may
undertake to manage the properties of others. It will have to. appoint persons to detect
encroachment and to take steps to recover possession of lands encroached upon. The only difference
between a firm and a municipal corporation is that the corporation can, in exercise of its statutory
powers, remove the encroachment, but it does not prevent the aggrieved party from going to a civil
court to establish his title to the property : but in the case of a firm, it cannot take the law into its
own hands: it has to get the encroachment removed through a court of law. So far as the nature of
the service is concerned, namely, protecting its properties in the interest of the public from
encroachment and to recover possession of the lands encroached upon, there is no essential
distinction between the said service of the Corporation and a similar service performed by a private
firm. The service satisfies not only the terms of the definition, but also the tests laid down by us.
Even so, it is contended that, the said reasoning cannot be invoked in the case of the-service
rendered by the municipality in removing dilapidated houses and it is said that the said service is
rendered in exercise of a governmental function which a private individual cannot himself
discharge. Here again the incidental power is confused with the service. To illustrate, a firm may
undertake to remove dilapidated houses and render the said service to those who engage it. It may
not have the power to remove dilapidated houses of persons other than those who employed its
services. The difference does not in any way affect the' character of the service. We, therefore, hold
that this department is also an industry.

(viii) Sewage Department; The sewage pumping station is meant for pumping sewage at the outfall
of the underground sewers. The sewage is utilised on the land on broad irrigation system, and some
crops are also grown on the farm. (See the evidence of Witness No. 8 for Party No. 1). In the
cross-examination of the said witness it was elicited that whatever sewage is left after irrigating the
farm maintained by the Corporation will be sold to the neighbouring farms. For the said reasons, it
must be held that this department is also an industry.

(ix) Health Department: This department looks after scavenging, sanitation, control of epidemics
control of food adulteration and running of public dispensaries. Private institutions can also render
these services. It is said that the control of food the adulteration and the control of epidemics cannot
be done by private individuals and institutions. We do not see why. There can be private medical
units to help in the control of food adulteration and in the control of epidemics for remuneration.
Individuals may get the food articles purchased by them examined by the medical unit and take
necessary action against guilty merchants. So too, they can take advantage of such a unit to prevent
epidemics by having necessary inoculations and advice. This department also satisfies the other
tests laid down by us, and is an industry within the meaning of the definition of "industry" in the
Act.

(x) Market Department: The function of the Market Department is to issue licences, collect
ground-rent and registration fee and to detect short weights and measures. Rents are collected for
permitting persons to enter the Corporation land and transact business thereon. Detection of short
weights and measures is a service to the people to prevent their being cheated in the market. The
setting apart of market places, supervision of weights and measures are services rendered to the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 18The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

public and the fees collected are remuneration for the services so rendered. 'These services can
equally be done by any private individual. This department; also satisfies the tests laid down by us.
We, therefore, hold that this department is an industry within the meaning of the Act.

(xi) Public Gardens Department: The functions of this department are the maintenance of public
parks and -gardens and laying of new gardens and parks; and planting of trees on road sides. (See
the evidence of Witness No. 5 for Party No. 1). This service is covered by the definition of " industry"
Any private individual can certainly perform the functions stated above and the fact that the
municipality has undertaken those duties does not affect the nature of the service. This also satisfies
the tests laid down by us. We, therefore, hold that this Department is an industry. (Xii) Public
Works Department : This department is in charge of construction and maintenance of public works
such as roads, drains, buildings, markets, public latrines etc. For the convenience of the public this
department is divided into zones and every zone has its office. The outdoor staff in the P.W.D.
consists of assistant engineer, overseers, sub-overseers, time- keepers, mates, carpenters, masons,
blacksmiths and coolies. The other staff, consisting of clerks and peons performs indoor duties. (See
the evidence of Witness No. 5 for Party No. 1). This department performs both administrative and
executive functions.The services rendered are such that they can equally be done by private
individuals and they come under the definition of "industry)', satisfying both the positive and
negative tests laid down by us in this regard.We, therefore, hold that this department is an industry.

(xiii) Assessment Department: This department deals with the assessment of taxes, fees and rates.
The same staff does the assessment work connected not only with taxes strictly so called but also
other fees and rates. As the services rendered, namely, scavenging and supply of water can be done
by private individuals, the State Industrial Court held that they come under the definition of
"industry" and therefore the department assessing fees and rates is also part of that industry. There
is no reason why a distinction should be made in regard to the assessment of taxes so-called and
that of fees and rates. The taxes are collected only for enabling the Corporation to render service to
the public and, as most of the services come under the definition of "industry", this department also,
in our view, is an industry within the meaning of the Act. That apart, the State Industrial Court has
held that the same staff does the work of assessment of house-tax as well as other fees and rates and
the work of this department is predominantly connected with the assessment of scavenging tax and
water rate. Applying the test of "paramount and predominant duty ", this department falls within
the definition of " industry " in the Act.

(xiv) Estate Department : This department maintains the record of property acquired, vested or
transferred to the Corporation and all buildings and roads constructed by the P.W.D. This
department lets out lands and houses belonging to the Corporation by public auction and gets
income therefrom, which no doubt is credited to the common fund. A department like this is equally
necessary in a private company which carries out functions similar to the Corporation. Maintenance
of records of the properties acquired, buildings and roads constructed and properties leased, is a
necessary administrative function correlated to the corresponding services. If the service such as
construction of buildings, roads etc., is an industry, its administrative wing is also an industry. The
department as a whole, both with its administrative and executive wings, for reasons stated in
connection with the other departments, is an industry.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 19The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

(xv) Education Department: This department looks after the primary education, i.e., compulsory
primary education. within the limits of the Corporation. (See the evidence of Witness No. 1 for Party
No. 1). This service can equally be done by private persons. This department satisfies the other tests.
The employees of this department coming under the definition of " employees " under the Act would
certainly be entitled to the benefits of the Act. (xvi) Printing Press Department: The printing press is
maintained by the Corporation for printing passes. It is also used for printing of by-laws and the
rules and proceedings and forms, and the by-laws and the rules so printed are sold to the public. For
the reasons stated supra in the case of the Water Works Department’ this department is also an
industry.

(xvii) Building Department: This department is really a " building permission department ". The
function of this department is to regulate construction of buildings by private individuals and to take
action against those who violate the by-laws and the provisions of the Corporation Act pertaining to
this department. It is said that the functions of this department are statutory and no private
individual can discharge those statutory functions. The question is not whether the discharge of
certain functions by the Corporation have statutory backing, but whether those functions can
equally be performed by private individuals. The provisions of the Corporation Act and the by-laws
prescribe certain specifications for submission of plans and for the sanction of the authorities
concerned before the building is put up. The same thing can be done by a co-operative society or a
private individual. Cooperative societies and private individuals can allot lands for building houses
in accordance with the conditions prescribed by law in this regard. The services of this department
are therefore analogous to those of a private individual with the difference that one has the statutory
sanction behind it and the other is governed by terms of contracts. This department functions in the
interest of the public and the services rendered by this department satisfy both the positive and
negative tests laid down by us. We, therefore, hold that this department is covered by the definition
of "industry ".

(xviii) General Administration Department : This department co-ordinates the functions of all the
other departments. The State Industrial Court describes the functions of this department thus: "
This department consists of treasury, accounts section, records section in which are kept records of
all the different departments and public relations section. It also consists of a committee section the
duty of which is to look after the convening of meetings, to draw up agenda, minutes of proceedings
and to draft by-laws. In the record section are kept records of most of the departments including
health and engineering." Every big company with different sections will have a general
administration department. If the various departments collated with this department are industries,
this department would also be a part of the industry. Indeed the efficient rendering of all the
services would depend upon the proper working of this department, for, otherwise there would be
confusion and chaos. The state Industrial, Court in this case has held that all except five of the
departments of the Corporation come under the definition of "industry" and if so, it follows that this
department, dealing predominantly with industrial departments, is also an industry. Hence the
employees of this department, are also entitled to the benefits of this Act.

The State Industrial Court held that five of the departments of the Corporation did not fall within
the terms of the definition of "industry " in the Act. The employees of these -departments did not file

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733637/ 20The Corporation Of The City ... vs Its Employees on 10 March, 1960

any appeal against the finding of the State Industrial Court and we do not propose to express our
final opinion on the correctness of the decision of the Industrial Court in regard to these activities.

In the result the appeals fail and are dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed.

1860 (in short the 'IPC’) and sentencing each of 10 years imprisonment.

3. Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:

On 24.6.2001 at 9.00 p.m. on Mulbagal-Punganoor road PWs 2 and 3 were going on a Bajaj Scooter.
When they were near 'Kirumani Mitta' of 'Buddadoru village", accused persons 2 to 5 intercepted
PWs 2 and 3, and robbed the gold chain, golden ear drops, thali and cash of Rs.400/- by threatening
with knife. The accused tied the legs and hands of PW-2 and PW-3 and threatened them not to
escape and get out from the place for about ten minutes after their departure. The victims went to
Punganoor Police Station and later on lodged First Information Report with Nangali Police (Kolar
Dist.) on 25.6.2001. The Traffic Police while checking found A-2, A-3 and A-4 were going on the
scooter (M.O.6) they had robbed from PW-2, the deadly weapons like knives, pistol, iron rod, etc.
were hidden in the scooter. On interrogation, the accused persons admitted the commission of
offence in question. A-5 and A-8 were arrested on the information given by A-2 to A-4. At the
instance of A-2, the gold jewellery (M.Os.2 and 3) are recovered from PW-6-Pawn broker. The Bajaj
Scooter (M.O.6) was seized from A-2, A-3 and A-4. PW-13 with whom the ear- studs and the chain
were pledged by A-2, testified to the said fact. PWs 2 and 3 identified A-2 to A-5 as the persons who
robbed them. Prosecution claimed that the identification of accused persons by PWs 2 and 3
coupled with the recovery of jewellery at the instance of A-2 and seizure of scooter from A- 2, A-3
and A-4 clinchingly established the guilt of A-2 to A-5.

The investigating agency submitted charge sheet for alleged commission of offence punishable
under Section 395 of IPC. The case was split up against A-1, A-6 and A-7 as they were absconding.

Learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kolar referred to the evidence of PWs 1 and 2, the recovery of
the scooter, the recovery of stolen articles and identification thereon to conclude that accused
persons are guilty and accordingly A-2 to A-5 were convicted for offence punishable under Section
395 IPC. Accused 7 and 8 were acquitted as the evidence was not sufficient to find them guilty.
Considering the gravity of the offence, custodial sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of
Rs.5,000/- each was imposed. In appeal, the High Court found that the offence committed was
covered under Section 392 IPC, but considering the gravity of the offence upheld the sentence.

4. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the evidence of PWs 2
and 3 does not show that any knife was used for robbery. On the contrary, evidence of victim clearly
shows that she raised hue and cry when accused persons tried to snatch the stolen articles from her.
It was also submitted that the appellants have suffered custody of more than nearly 8 years and the
sentence deserves to be reduced to the period already undergone.

5. Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted that there is no minimum
sentence prescribed and the maximum sentence is 10 years. It is submitted that the robbery was
committed on the highway at about 9.00 p.m. That being so, the sentence can be upto 14 years.
Considering the gravity of the offence and the large scale highway robberies, no leniency should be
shown.

6. Section 392 IPC provides for punishment for robbery. The essential ingredients are as follows:

1. Accused committed theft;

2. Accused voluntarily caused or attempted to cause.

(i) death, hurt or wrongful restraint.

(ii) Fear of instant death, hurt or wrongful restraint.

3. He did either act for the end.

(i) to commit theft.

(ii) While committing theft.

(iii) In carrying away or in the attempt to carry away property obtained by theft.

7. It is to be noted that the Section 392 provides punishment for robbery. It is punishment for the
offence defined in Section 390. Punishment is higher if it is committed on a highway and between

sunset and sunrise. Section 390 which defines "robbery" reads as follows:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141374/ 2Venu @ Venugopal And Ors vs State Of Karnataka on 30 January, 2008

390. Robbery.- In all robbery there is either theft or extortion.

When theft is robbery.-Theft is "robbery" if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing
the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by theft, the offender,
for the end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt wrongful restraint,
or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.

When extortion is robbery.-Extortion is "robbery" if the offender at the time of committing the
extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that
person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to
some other person, and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then, and there to
deliver up the thing extorted.

Explanation.-The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near put the other person in fear
of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint."

8. The provision defines robbery which is theft or extortion when caused with violence of death, hurt
or wrongful restraint. When there is no theft committed, then as a natural corollary there cannot be
robbery. Robbery is only an aggravated form of offence of theft or extortion. Aggravation is in the
use of violence of death, hurt or restraint. Violence must be in course of theft and not subsequently.
It is not necessary that violence actually should be committed but even attempt to commit it is
enough.

g. The authors of the Code observed as follows:

"In one single class of cases, theft and extortion are in practice confounded together so inextricably,
that no judge, however, sagacious, could discriminate between them. This class of cases, therefore,
has, in all systems of jurisprudence ... been treated as a perfectly distinct class ... we have, therefore,
made robbery a separate crime.

There can be no case of robbery which does not fall within the definition either of theft or of
extortion; but in a practice it will perpetually be a matter of doubt whether a particular act of
robbery was a theft or an extortion. A large proportion of robberies will be half theft, half extortion.
A seizes Z, threatens to murder him, unless he delivers all his property, and begins to pull off Z's
ornaments. Z in terror begs that A will take all he has, and spare his life, assists in taking off his
ornaments, and delivers them to A. Here, such ornaments as A took without Z's consent are taken by
theft. Those which Z delivered up from fear of death are acquired by extortion. It is by no means
improbable that Z's right arm bracelet may have been obtained by theft, and left-arm bracelet by
extortion; that the rupees in Z's girdle may have been obtained by theft, and those in his turban by
extortion. Probably in nine-tenths of the robberies which are committed, something like this
actually takes place, and it is probable that a few minutes later neither the robber nor the person
robbed would be able to recollect in what proportions theft and extortion were mixed in the crime;
nor is it at all necessary for the ends of justice that this should be ascertained. For though, in
general, the consent of a sufferer is a circumstance which very materially modifies the character of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141374/ 3Venu @ Venugopal And Ors vs State Of Karnataka on 30 January, 2008

the offence, and which ought, therefore, to be made known to the Courts, yet the consent which a
person gives to the taking of this property by a ruffian who holds a pistol to his breast is a
circumstance altogether immaterial".

10. The words "for that end" in Section 390 clearly mean that the hurt caused must be with the
object of facilitating the committing of the theft or must be caused while the offender is committing
theft or is carrying away or is attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft.

11. As the provision itself provides when the highway robbery is committed, deterrent punishment is
called for.

12. In the instant case, the evidence of the victim, her husband, the factum of recovery of the vehicle
used has clearly established the commission of offence by the appellants. The offence was
committed on a public road. There is no dispute that it was not a highway. It is also not in dispute
that the offence was committed during sunset and sunrise that is, at about 9.00 p.m.

13. In State of Karnataka v. Puttaraja (2004 (1) SCC 475), it was inter-alia observed as follows:

"Imposition of sentence without considering its effect on the social order in many cases may be in
reality a futile exercise. The social impact of the crime e.g. where it relates to offences against
women like the case at hand, dacoity, kidnapping, misappropriation of public money, treason and
other offences involving moral turpitude or moral delinquency which have great impact and serious
repercussions on social order and public interest, cannot be lost sight of and per se require
exemplary treatment. Any liberal attitude by imposing meager sentences or taking too sympathetic a
view merely on account of lapse of time or considerations personal to the accused only in respect of
such offences will be resultwise counterproductive in the long run and against societal interest
which needs to be cared for and strengthened by the required string of deterrence inbuilt in the
sentencing system."

14. Above being the position, there is no merit in this appeal which is accordingly dismissed.
