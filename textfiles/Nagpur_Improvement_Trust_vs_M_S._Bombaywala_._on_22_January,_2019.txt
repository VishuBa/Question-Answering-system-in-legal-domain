occupants/tenants of the building in question and by which the Division Bench has set aside the
notice dated 24.04.2015 issued by the Nagpur Improvement Trust, the original
respondentsLNagpur Improvement Trust and others have preferred the present appeals.

 

3. The facts leading to the present appeals in nutshell are as under.

4. That the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act 1936 (hereinafter referred to as the NIT Act) was
enacted on 25.12.1936. That the Nagpur Improvement Trust (hereinafter referred to as the NIT)
vide Board Resolution dated 29.10.1960 framed an improvement Scheme known as Abhyankar
Road Widening and Buty Mahal Street Scheme (hereinafter referred to as the Scheme) in respect of
8.7 acres of land bearing Khasra No.320 and 315 (part) Mouza Sitabuldi, belonging to the Buty
Family. That the same Scheme came to be framed under Section 31 of NIT Act for creating new or
improving the existing means of communications and facilities for traffic. That, inter alia, a new 15
metres wide road was to be constructed to join Mahatma Gandhi Road to Abhyankar Road. That the
internal road of 15 metres provided in the said Scheme is the subject matter of issue in the present
matters. That, the said Scheme came to be published on 29.10.1961 as per Section 39 of the NIT Act.
That, the NIT sought approval of the State Government of the above Scheme. That the State
Government sanctioned the said Scheme in exercise of powers under Section 44(1) read with Section

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 2Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

45(1)(a) of the NIT Act on 23.09.1964. Accordingly, a Notification to that effect was also issued
under Section 45 of the NIT Act.

4.1 That, thereafter, the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as
the MRTP Act) came into effect on 11.01.1967. At this stage, it is required to be noted that, as per the
MRTP Act, any Development Plan made under the said Act had to take precedence over any Scheme
to the contrary. The same shall be discussed hereinbelow.

4.2 That NIT was appointed as the Planning Authority under the MRTP Act for Nagpur. That, in the
year 1967, the First Final Development Plan for the City of Nagpur under Sections 22 and 31 of the
MRTP Act was prepared and sanctioned. At this stage, it is required to be noted that, in the said
final Development Plan, the above 15 metres road which was provided under the Town Planning
Scheme under the NIT Act was not shown in the Development Plan under the MRTP Act.

4.3 That the NIT, in Board meeting dated 05.06.1981 and 31.12.1981, decided to implement the
Scheme. That, a Special Land Acquisition Officer came to be appointed by the State Government for
acquisition of the land and the proceedings of the land acquisition came to be initiated. 4.4 That a
newspaper article was published on 21.06.1981 stating that the NIT has decided to handover the
Buty Mahal Development Scheme to the land owners for redevelopment. That, in the year 1983, a
Writ Petition being WP.No.2326 of 1983 was filed by the land owners before the Nagpur Bench of
the Bombay High Court challenging the acquisition. Initially, the High Court granted an interim stay
on the acquisition proceedings.

4.5 That, on 07.06.1984, the land owners Shri Yogeshwar Buty and Smt. Madhuribai Buty
approached NIT to allot a reconstituted plot or plots bearing Nos.6, 7 and 8 belonging to them.
However, the said request came to be rejected by the NIT on 17.08.1984.

4.6 That, on 13.03.1995, one Smt. Indirabai Buty (land owner) submitted an application for
permission to develop the land stating inter alia, that; (1) Development of the land would be as per
the Development Plan of the NIT; (2) All the tenants would be accommodated in the proposed
Scheme; (3) The betterment charges would be paid to the NIT. That, the Board of NIT in its meeting
held on 11.03.1996 passed a Resolution wherein it was, inter alia, decided ..(1) A plot was allocated
in the matter of Shri Yadhuraj Sanghani; (2) Smt. Indirabai Buty and others land owners to
accommodate in their proposed Scheme, the tenants in the area of the reconstituted plot and (3) All
the petitions in respect of the subject plot would have to be withdrawn unconditionally. On the basis
of the said Resolution of the NIT dated 11.03.1996, Writ Petition No.2326 of 1983 challenging the
acquisition was withdrawn by the land owners.

4.7 In the meantime, in the year 1989, the First Final Development Plan which was earlier prepared
and sanctioned in the year 1986, came to be revised. Again, the above 15 metres internal road was
not depicted in the revised DP. 4.8 It appears that, in the year 1997, NIT addressed letters to the
Urban Development Department requesting the latter to obtain permission from the Government to
relax Rule 5(2) of the NIT (Land Disposal) Rules, 1983 (hereinafter referred to as the 1983 Rules)
under Rule 26 of the 1983 Rules, to allocate the reconstituted plot in the present Scheme. That the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 3Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

State Government vide order dated 07.10.1997 issued under Rule 26 of the 1983 Rules relaxed Rule
5(2) and allotted the reconstituted plot in Survey Nos.3117, 3119, 3123, 3127, 3120, 3122, 3124 and
3125 in Khasra No.320 Mouza Sitabuldi, subject to certain conditions including inter alia that (i)
The Applicants would accept the compensation of the land fixed by the Land Acquisition Officer and
give possession of the lands to him; (ii) Development of the land would as per the Development Plan
of NIT; (iii) All the tenants are to be accommodated in the Scheme and (iv) That in the interest of
tenants the NIT fixed the plot allotment rate @ 50% of the market value, without prejudice to Rule
7(3) of the 1983 Rules.

4.9 That the NIT passed a Board Resolution on 23.10.1997 to implement the altered Scheme in
terms of G.O. dated 07.10.1997. That the Special Land Acquisition Officer, NIT passed an Award
dated 16.12.1997 in respect of the land admeasuring 5677 sq.ft bearing Khasra No.320 Sitabuldi,
Nagpur. That, pursuant to the Award declared by the Land Acquisition Officer, possession of the
land was taken by the Land Acquisition Officer and handed over to NIT. It appears that, out of
271552.60 sq.ft of the land, only 114079.36 sq.ft was acquired by NIT and the rest of the lands
remained with the land owners.

4.10 That the Final Development Plan in terms of Section 31 of the MRTP came to sanctioned in the
year 2001. 4.11 That pursuant to the G.O. dated 07.10.1997, the process of widening of the
Abhyankar road was initiated and notices were issued for demolition of shops. At that stage, Writ
Petition No.798 of 2002 was filed by some of the Abhyankar Road tenants challenging the
demolition notices issued by the NIT to the tenants in the process of road widening. The said Writ
Petition came to be dismissed by the High Court by judgment and order dated 22.02.2002. The
matter was carried before this Court. Before this Court, a compromise was reached between the
petitioners of W.P.No.798 of 2002 and land owners and NIT. By order dated 08.04.2002, SLP©
No.4846 of 2002 was disposed of in terms of the compromise arrived at between the land owners,
the tenants (only on writ petitioners) original petitioners to W.P.No.725 of 2002), wherein inter alia
the following conditions were specified:

The Landlord shall construct a multiLstoreyed building on the reconstituted plot that
was to be allotted to him by the NIT.

The Tenant and Landlord shall within a period of one week from the filing of the
compromise petition would vacate such area out of the property covered in the
instant proceedings in their possession as is required for widening of the Abhayankar
Road.

The compromise also provided, NIT to allot one single reconstituted plot and redevelopment of suit
property to be carried out in accordance with the Development Plan of Nagpur City and all tenants
to be rehoused post development. 4.12 That thereafter, on the request made by the owners, the
Resolution was passed by the NIT dated 23.10.2003 to allot a single reconstituted plot admeasuring
10602.09 sq.mts as undivided share and the same was offered to the Buty family. That thereafter,
the Government by letter dated 12.11.2003 allotted the reconstituted plot to the owners. From the
letter dated 12.11.2003, it appears that the land for road will be provided as per the Development

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 4Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

Plan and that the beneficiaries will have to make land available for road widening and parking.

4.13 It appears that thereafter the NIT represented to the State Government vide Representations
dated 16.08.2005 and 29.03.2006 purportedly under Section 37(1) of the MRTP Act in order to
increase the width of the Abhyankar Road from 12 metres to 24 metres and for converting the
reconstituted plot from residential to commercial in order to accommodate the tenants running
commercial shops.

4.14 It appears that thereafter on 02.08.2006, the owners entered into a development agreement
with one of the petitioners herein M/s Goel Ganga Infrastructure & Real Estate Pvt. Ltd. For
developing the property bearing Khasra No.320.

4.15 That thereafter the State Government passed an order dated 22.06.2007 under Section 37(1) of
the MRTP Act permitting the change of use in respect of Khasra No.320 and 315 (Part) from
residential to commercial. It appears that the permission was also granted by the State to widen the
Abhyankar Road to 24 metres in place of 12 metres. 4.16 It appears that thereafter the provisional
sanction was granted by NIT on 22.04.2008 to the drawing/building map to the layout plan
submitted by developer for the construction of a commercial complex. It appears that thereafter vide
letter dated 18.08.2009, the NIT issued a letter to the land owners allotting a single reconstituted
plot admeasuring 114079.36 sq.mts to the land owners, subject to the conditions mentioned in the
said letter. That thereafter, on 10.02.2010, a lease deed was executed between the NIT and the land
owners in respect of the reconstituted plot subject to the terms and conditions mentioned in the
allotment letter dated 18.08.2009. It appears that thereafter on 15.05.2012, the NIT sanctioned the
Final Layout Plan in respect of the reconstituted plot as per the D.C.R. of Nagpur City. That the
building plan also came to be sanctioned on 27.06.2012 in accordance with the D.C.R. of Nagpur
City. That, on 10.12.2014, building permit and commencement certificates were issued by the NIT
subject to certain conditions specified therein. That a revised building plan was also sanctioned by
the NIT on 11.12.2014 subject to the conditions mentioned therein.

4.17 That thereafter on 24.04.2015, the NIT issued notices to the tenants asking them to vacate a
portion of their shops so as to enable construction as per the layout plan. 4.18 The aforesaid notices
gave rise to filing of Writ Petition No.2695 of 2015 before the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench.
In the said Writ Petition, the Respondents Nos.1 to 18 herein the original writ petitioners prayed
inter alia for an order quashing the notices issued by the NIT on 24.04.2015. That the said petition
was opposed by the original writ petitioners as well as the NIT. It appears that thereafter the original
writ petitioners filed an application being C.A.No.1615 of 2015 in W.P.No.2695 of 2015 praying for
amendment to the prayers in the writ petition and allow them to challenge the sanctioned plan
dated 27.06.2012 and the revised plan dated 11.12.2014. The said amendment was opposed by the
original land owners and the developers. However, thereafter High Court allowed the said
Amendment application. 4.19 It appears that, during the course of the hearing, the High Court by
order dated 03.09.2015 in W.P.No.2695 of 2015 directed the Chairman, NIT to explore the
possibility of an amicable settlement by calling the representatives of both the tenants and the
developers and land owners and directed to submit a report to the Court. It appears that, pursuant
to the order dated 03.09.2015, the Chairman, NIT called all the parties. That thereafter the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 5Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

Chairman, NIT submitted a report on 15.10.2015 stating that no settlement could be arrived at
between the parties.

4.20 That thereafter, by impugned judgment and order, the High Court has allowed the Writ
Petition and has quashed and set aside the demolition notice dated 28.04.2015 issued by the NIT.
The High Court has also further observed that it will be open for the NIT to issue fresh notices of
demolition to the writ petitioners after the sanctioned layout plan dated 15.05.2012, the building
permit granted on 27.06.2012 revised on 11.12.2014 as well as the construction, if any, carried out
are brought in conformity with the Scheme published under Section 45 of the NIT Act of
23.09.1964. While passing the impugned judgment and order the High Court has observed and held
that the layout plan sanctioned in the building permit granted are contrary to the provisions of the
Scheme published and sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act and that the same suffers from
vice of internal mischief.

4.21 That the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court dated 15.09.2016 in
W.P.No.2595 of 2016 is the subject matter of the present appeals.

5. It appears that, in the meantime and after the impugned judgment and order passed by the High
Court, the original Scheme sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act which provided 15 metres
internal road came to be modified as provided under the NIT Act by deleting 15 metres internal
road. The same came to be published in the Government of Maharashtra Gazette on 24.04.2017.
That the W.P.No.5005 of 2017 was filed by the 18 tenants/shopkeepers before the Nagpur Bench,
Bombay High Court questioning the Resolution passed by the NIT dated 24.04.2017 issued under
Section 46 of the NIT Act deleting 15 metres internal road and another internal road from the
Scheme. That a Transfer Case No.23 of 2018 was filed before this Court praying inter alia for
transfer of W.P.No.5005 of 2017 to this Court. That is how, the Transfer Case No.23 of 2015 is also
listed along with the present group of appeals.

5.1 We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties in the transferred Writ
Petition No.5005 of 2017 also, along with the other appeals arising out of the impugned judgment
and order dated 15.09.2016 passed in W.P.No.2695 of 2015.

6. Mr. V. Giri, Mr. Mukul Rohtagi and Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf
of the respective appellants have vehemently submitted that the impugned judgment and order
passed by the High Court is contrary to the provisions of MRTP Act and also the law laid down by
this Court in the case of Manohar Joshi vs. State of Maharashtra & Anr. 2012 (3) SCC 619.

 

6.1 The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective appellantsLoriginal respondents have
vehemently submitted that while passing the impugned judgment and order the High Court has not
properly appreciated and considered the relevant provisions of MRTP Act. 6.2 The learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the respective appellants have vehemently submitted that though in the
original Scheme framed under the provisions of the NIT, 1936 there was a provision for 15 metres
internal road, thereafter when the MRTP Act came to be enacted and came into force and the
Development Plan framed and sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act did not contain any

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 6Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

internal road as was there in the Scheme published under Section 45 of the NIT Act, in view of the
provisions of the MRTP Act, the Development Plan overrides the DP Scheme and, therefore, there is
no question of providing any internal road. It is submitted that the High Court has not properly
appreciated the abovesaid at all.

6.3 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective
appellants that, as per the law laid down in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra), the DP Plan overrides
the Scheme; and anything contrary to the DP Plan in the Scheme shall have to be varied to bring it
in line with the Development Plan sanctioned under the provisions of MRTP Act. It is submitted
that, therefore, the High Court has materially erred in quashing and setting aside the notices of
demolition which are based upon final layout plan sanctioned on 15.05.2012 and building permit
granted on 27.06.2012, and revised on 11.12.2014, which were as per the provisions of MRTP Act.

6.4 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective appellants
that the High Court has materially erred in misreading and/or misinterpreting the judgment of this
Court in Manohar Joshi (supra) and held that the statutory obligations created upon the NIT under
Section 45 of the NIT Act to execute the Scheme to the extent it is not in variation or modification of
the proposals in the Final Development Plan, continues to subsist and can be enforced. It is
vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the respective appellants that the
aforesaid observations are just contrary to the observations made by this Court in the case of
Manohar Joshi (supra). It is submitted that in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra) this Court has
specifically observed and held that even if such a variation as directed under Section 39 of MRTP
Act does not take place, the land cannot be put to use in any way in contradiction with the provisions
in the DP Plan. 6.5 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
respective appellants that even the aforesaid finding and the observation are contrary to Section 43
of the MRTP Act which provides that once the declaration of intention to prepare a Development
Plan is presented, no development contrary thereto can be permitted. 6.6 It is further submitted by
the learned counsel for the respective appellants that the High Court has not properly appreciated
and considered the fact that, in view of the subsequent development and the widening of the existing
road, there was no necessity for internal road as provided in the Scheme under the NIT Act. It is
submitted that as such in view of the subsequent development and widening of the existing road,
when subsequently the DP under the MRTP Act was prepared, there was no provision for 15 metres
internal road as provided earlier in the Scheme under the NIT Act. 6.7 It is further submitted by the
learned counsel that the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that as such in the
Development Plan prepared under the provisions of MRTP Act, which was first prepared in the year
1976 and in the subsequent DP, there was no provision for the internal road and, despite the same,
the same was not challenged by the original writ petitioners. It is submitted that even initially what
was challenged in the main writ petition was demolition notices. It is submitted that even
subsequently also the DP prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of MRTP Act, which does
not contain any provision for internal road was not under challenge at all. It is submitted that,
therefore, the layout plan came to be sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act and the
building permit was issued under the provisions of MRTP Act, which came to be challenged
subsequently by way of amendment. It is submitted that in view of the relevant provisions of the
MRTP Act, the construction has to be made as per the layout plan and the building permit granted

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 7Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

under the provisions of MRTP ACT. It is submitted, that, therefore, the High Court has materially
erred in quashing and setting aside the final layout plan as well as the building permit solely on the
ground that the same is in contravention of the Scheme published under Section 45 of the NIT Act.

6.8 It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the Appellants that the High Court has not
properly appreciated and considered the stand of the NIT that punctuated lines in the Development
Plan only indicate the boundaries of the Scheme under the control of the NIT and it has no more
significance than this.

6.9 It is further submitted by the learned counsel that the High Court has materially erred in
observing that, in the absence of any provisions contrary to the internal road, shown in the
Development Plan, it cannot be said that the provisions of the internal road vanishes automatically.
It is submitted that the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that as such the
Development Plan which has been prepared in consonance with the provisions of the MRTP Act,
specifically do not provide any internal road, which was earlier provided in the Scheme under the
NIT Act. 6.10 It is further submitted by the learned counsel that even the Government Resolution
dated 07.10.1997 specifically provided and/or permitted to develop the land in question as per the
Development Plan and not as per the Scheme. It is submitted by learned counsel that while issuing
G.O. dated 07.10.1997, it was specifically noted that the 50 ft. (15 metres) wide road through the
land is not provided under the Development Plan. It is submitted that the aforesaid was even
considered and noted by the NIT. It is submitted that despite the above the High Court has observed
that all throughout the NIT desired to implement the Scheme. 6.11 It is further submitted by the
learned counsel that the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that even one consolidated
plot was allotted under the provisions of the MRTP Act and thereafter the layout plan as per the
provisions of the MRTP Act was submitted and got sanctioned and the development permission was
obtained to carry out the construction which was granted as per the DP sanctioned under the
provisions of MRTP Act. It is submitted that the High Court has materially erred in quashing and
setting aside the demolition notices which as such were consequent upon the sanction of the layout
plan and the grant of the permission. It is submitted that the High Court has materially erred in
quashing and setting aside the sanctioned layout plan as well as the development permission
granted under the provisions of the MRTP Act. It is further submitted by the learned counsel that
the High Court has, therefore, materially erred in observing and holding that grant of
permission/sanction of layout plan which was in contravention of the Scheme under the NIT Act
was a mischief in law to provide an unfair advantage to the developers and the owners and it
deprives the facility of frontage to the tenants on the internal road. 6.12 It is further submitted by
the learned counsel that the High Court has materially erred in not appreciating the fact that only 18
tenants filed the writ petition and were aggrieved, against which majority of the tenants accepted the
settlement/compromise before this Court. It is stated that the appellants are ready and willing to
provide the same benefit to the original writ petitioners herein also. It is submitted, however, for
some oblique reason and/or to get some more benefits, only 18 tenants approached the High Court
and filed the writ petition.

6.13 The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respective appellants have vehemently
submitted that, on one hand, the High Court has specifically observed that, in paragraph 86, the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 8Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

High Court has not set aside and it is also not necessary for the High Court to set aside the layout
plan and the building permit granted by the NIT, the ultimate observation made by the High Court
in paragraph 89(2) would tantamount to quashing and setting aside the sanctioned layout plan and
even the building permit. 6.14 Making the above submissions and relying upon the provisions of
NIT Act as well as the MRTP Act and the decision of this Court in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra),
it is requested to allow the present appeals and quash and set aside the impugned judgment and
order passed by the High Court.

7. The present appeals are vehemently opposed by Ms. Rukhmini Bobde, learned Advocate
appearing for the writ petitioners and Ms. Deepa Kulkarni learned Advocate also. 7.1 The learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners have supported the impugned judgment
and order passed by the High Court.

7.2 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ
petitioners that the impugned judgment and order passed by this High Court is absolutely in
consonance with the provisions of the NIT Act as well as the MRTP Act, which is not required to be
interfered by this Court.

7.3 It is vehemently submitted by learned counsel for original writ petitioners that on true
interpretation of the provisions of NIT Act, more particularly Section 45(3) and 45 of the NIT Act,
the High Court has rightly observed and held that unless and until the Scheme sanctioned under the
NIT Act is varied and/or is modified under the provisions of the NIT Act, the Scheme shall prevail
and shall have to be acted upon.

7.4 The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners have emphasised on the
object and purpose to provide 15 metres internal road in the Scheme sanctioned under the NIT Act.
It is submitted that the internal road provided in the Scheme sanctioned under Section 45 of the
NIT Act was a part of Street Scheme so as to avoid the traffic congestion. It is submitted that the use
of land in question on the date of such Scheme was initially for residential purposes with internal
road, one cinema theatre and the peripheral area being used for shops/offices purposes. It is
submitted that the object and purpose for providing the internal road under the Scheme/Street
Scheme was for creating new or improving existing means of communication and facilities for
traffic. It is submitted that the execution of the Scheme was for (i) providing huge commercial
complex inside the Scheme area to accommodate the tenants apart from others, (ii) widening of
Mahatma Gandhi Road and Abhyankar Road outside the Scheme area; (iii) providing 50 ft (15
metres) wide internal road along with others two roads inside the Scheme area to ease out the traffic
and removing congestion, and (iv) to provide space open to sky for parking . It is submitted that,
therefore, once there was a Scheme/Street Scheme as sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act
with specific object and purpose, merely because in the Development Plan prepared under the
MRTP Act, there was no specific reference to the internal road, it cannot be said that the sanctioned
Scheme which was sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act is not to be implemented, even if the
same is not varied or modified under the provisions of the NIT Act.

7.5 It is submitted that the High Court has rightly observed and held that unless and until the
Scheme is varied or is modified by the Planning Authority, which in the present case i.e. NIT, after
following the due process under Section 46 of the NIT Act, the Scheme has to be implemented and
anything including the sanction of the layout plan and/or grant of building permission which would
be in contravention of the Scheme under NIT Act, are illegal and contrary to the provisions of the
NIT as well as the MRTP Act, and, therefore, the High Court has rightly quashed and set aside the
demolition notices and has rightly observed that it would be open for the NIT to issue fresh notices
of demolition, after sanctioned plan, the building permit as well as construction, if any, carried out
are brought in conformity with the Scheme published under NIT Act on 23.06.1964.

7.6 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel that the impugned judgment and order passed
by the High Court is absolutely in furtherance of the object of the Scheme published under Section
45 of the NIT Act i.e. for better development and to avoid the traffic congestion. The learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court
in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra) reported in (2012) 3 SCC 619, in support of their submissions
that planning involving highly complex cities depends upon scientific research, study and
experience and, thus deserves due reverence and therefore, the Scheme which is prepared after due
consideration of necessity for better street planning has to be implemented, unless the same is
varied and/or is modified after following due procedure as required under the provisions of the NIT
Act.

7.7 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel that as the appellants have as such
subsequently implemented the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court by
modifying the Scheme which was earlier sanctioned and prepared under the NIT Act, as permitted
by the High Court and, therefore, now thereafter it is not open for the appellants to challenge the
impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court.

8. Now, so far as challenge to variation/modification of the Scheme under Section 46 of the NIT Act,
which is the subject matter of the Transfer Petition, it is vehemently submitted by the learned
counsel on behalf of the writ petitioners that the same is absolutely in breach of the provisions of the
NIT Act. It is submitted that a detail procedure required to be followed for variation and/or
modification of the Scheme as provided under the NIT Act has not been followed at all. It is
submitted that neither any objections were invited nor any opportunity was given to the writ
petitioners. It is submitted that, therefore, subsequent variation and/or modification of the Scheme
is absolutely illegal and deserves to be quashed and set aside. It is submitted that even the same can
be said to be in violation of the principles of natural justice. In support of the above, the learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitionersLthe tenants has heavily relied upon the decision
of this Court in Scheduled Caste and Weaker Section Welfare Association vs State of Karnataka
reported in (1991) 2 SCC SCC 604. 8.1 By making the above submission, it is requested to dismiss
the appeals and upheld the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court and to allow
the Transfer Petition and quash and set aside the variation and/or modification of the Scheme
published under Section 46 of the NIT Act.

9. Now, so far as the Transfer Petition is concerned, and challenge to the subsequent variation
and/or modification of the Scheme published under Section 46 of the NIT Act is concerned, the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the NIT as well as the original land owners and developers
have vehemently submitted that the Scheme is varied/modified after following due procedure
required under the provisions of the MRTP Act. It is submitted that, as per Section 39 of the MRTP
Act, where a final Development Plan contains proposals which are in variation, or modification of
those made in a Town Planning Scheme, which has been sanctioned by the State Government before
the commencement of the MRTP Act, the Planning Authority shall vary such Scheme suitably under
Section 92 to the extent necessary by the proposals made in the Final Development Plan. It is
submitted that Section 92 authorises the State Government to vary and/or modify the Scheme. It is
submitted that, therefore, if Sections 39 and 92 of the MRTP Act are conjointly read, it can be seen
that the variation of the Scheme subsequently shall be a formal action to bring the Scheme in
consonance with the Development Plan. It is submitted that, therefore, when the Development Plan
was sanctioned after inviting the objections etc. the subsequent variation of the Scheme to bring the
Scheme in consonance with the sanction Development Plan would be only a formality which is
required to be done under Section 92 of the MRTP Act. It is submitted that, therefore subsequent
variation and/or modification of the Scheme which in the present case would be as per Section 39
and Section 92 of the MRTP Act would be absolutely in consonance with the provisions of the MRTP
Act as well as the NIT Act. It is submitted that the provisions of the MRTP Act and NIT Act are
required to be read harmoniously to subLserve the objects and purposes of Sections 39 and Section
92 and other relevant provisions of the MRTP Act.

 

10. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original writ petitioners that in view of the fact
and subsequently the Scheme came to be varied as permitted by the High Court in the impugned
judgment and order and, therefore, the judgment and order passed by the High Court can be said to
have been implemented and, therefore, the appellants may not be permitted to challenge the
impugned judgment and order of the High Court is concerned, it is submitted that merely because
without prejudice and to be on safer side if the Scheme is varied and/or modified, it cannot be said
that appellants have waived their right to challenge the impugned judgment and order, more
particularly when the High Court by the impugned judgment and order has set aside the demolition
notices and virtually sought as to know that the sanctioned layout plan and validly granted the
building permit.

11. We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties. What is
challenged in the present batch of appeals is the impugned judgment and order dated 15.09.2016
passed by the Bombay High Court passed in Writ Petition No.2695 of 2015. On consideration of the
impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it appears that the following two questions
fell for determination before the High Court:

1. Whether mere absence of proposal of internal road in the final Development Plan under
subLéection (6) of section 31 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act and its existence
in the Scheme, published under Section 45 of the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, can be termed as
variation or modification, as contemplated by section 39 of the MRTP Act?,

 

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 11Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

1. Whether the impugned notices of demolition, based upon final layout plan sanctioned on
15052012 and the building permit granted on 27(06[4012 and revised on 114212014, need to be
set aside for want of Internal Road, which was the part of the Scheme sanctioned under Section 44
of the NIT Act? 11.1 It is required to be noted that initially demolition notices dated 24.04.2015 were
challenged before the High Court issued by the NIT. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the
said demolition notices were issued consequent upon the sanctioned layout plan dated 15.05.2012,
the building permit granted on 27.06.2012 and revised on 11.12.2014. Subsequently, by an
amendment, the original writ petitioners challenged the plan sanctioned by the NIT on 27.06.2012
and the sanction granted to the revised plan on 11.12.2014. The said amendment was allowed. The
challenge was mainly on the ground that the sanction granted is illegal and contrary to the Scheme.
The Scheme which was sanctioned in the year 1964 under Section 45 of the NIT Act provided 15
metres internal road. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the improvement Scheme known
as the Abhyankar Road Widening and Buty Mahal Street Scheme was prepared and sanctioned
under the provisions of NIT Act in the year 1964. However, thereafter, the MRTP Act came to be
enacted and came into effect subsequent to the enactment of the NIT Act i.e. with effect from
28.12.1966. From the chronology of list of events noted hereinabove it appears and it is not in
dispute that the First Final Development Plan under Section 31 of the MRTP Act came to be
sanctioned on 03.06.1976, which do not contain 15 metres internal road as was there in the Scheme
sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act. Even subsequently also, when the DP was revised in the
year 1989 and thereafter in 2001, the above internal road was not depicted in the revised DP. That
thereafter the Government allotted reconstituted composite plot under the MRTP Act and original
land owners/developers submitted the layout plan, which came to be sanctioned by the NIT and
even the building permission was granted under the provisions of the MRTP Act. Therefore, the NIT
issued the demolition notices dated 24.04.2015 impugned before the High Court so as to
allow/permit the original land owners/developers to put up the construction on the land in question
as per the sanctioned layout plan and the building construction permission. The High Court by the
impugned judgment and order has held that as in the Scheme sanctioned under Section 45 of the
NIT Act 15 metres internal road is provided, unless the same is varied and/or modified under
Section 46 of the NIT Act by the Planning Authority, the same shall have to be implemented and
thereby the High Court has quashed and set aside the notices of demolition dated 24.04.2015
keeping it open for the NIT to issue fresh notices of demolition to the original writ petitioners after
the sanctioned layout plan dated 15.05.2012, the building permit granted dated 27.06.2012 and
revised on 11.12.2014 as well as the construction, if any, carried out are brought in conformity with
the Scheme published under Section 45 of the NIT Act on 23.06.1964.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.2 Therefore, the short question which is posed for consideration before this Court is whether, in
the facts and circumstances of the case, when the Development Plan sanctioned under the
provisions of MRTP Act do not provide an internal road from the land in question, still the Scheme
published under Section 45 of the NIT Act which provided 15 metres internal road would be
applicable and/or would have to be implemented, though the Scheme may be contrary to the
Development Plan sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act ?

11.3 To answer the aforesaid question the object and purpose of MRTP Act, relevant provisions of
MRTP Act are required to be referred to and considered. 11.4 From the statement and object of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 42Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

MRTP Act 1966, it appears that the same has been enacted to make provisions for: (1) planning the
development and use of land in regions established for their purposes and for constitution of
Regional Planning Boards therefor; (2) to make better provisions for the preparation of
Development Plan with a view to ensuring that Town Planning Schemes are made in the proper
manner and the execution is made effective; (3) to provide for the compulsory acquisition of land
required for public purposes in respect of the plans, and (4) for purposes connected with the matters
aforesaid. The said Act is enacted to make provisions for planning the development and the use of
land in regions established for their purpose and to ensuring that Town Planning Schemes are made
in a proper manner and their execution is made effective. Therefore, the MRTP Act came to be
enacted with aforesaid object and purpose.

11.5 Section 3 of the Act permits the State Government to establish any area in the State to be a
region. A regional plan is supposed to be prepared for various subjects which are mentioned in
Section 14 of the Act. The Development Plan is defined under Section 2(9) of the Act as a plan for
the development or redevelopment of the area within the jurisdiction of Planning Authority. Section
2(19) defines the Planning Authority to mean a local authority, and it includes some other specified
authorities also. There is no dispute that the Development Plan has to be prepared in accordance
with the provisions of regional plan which is what is specifically stated in Section 21(1) of the Act.
11.6 Section 39 of the MRTP Act provides for DSection 39. Variation of town planning scheme by
development plan where a final development plan contains proposals which are in variation or
modification of those made in a town planning scheme which has been sanctioned by the State
Government before the commencement of this Act, the Planning Authority shall vary such scheme
suitably under Section 92 to the extent necessary by the proposals made in the final development
plan. 11.7 We are concerned with the Final Development Plan of 1976 which does not contain the 15
metres internal road from the land in question as against the 15 metres internal road provided in the
final Scheme of 1964. Thus the Scheme of 1964 prepared and sanctioned the provisions of the NIT
Act to the extent of providing 15 metres internal road can be said to be not in consonance with the
Development Plan sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act. 11.8 Section 43 of the MRTP
Act provides for restrictions on development of the land after the date on which the declaration of
intention to prepare the Development Plan for any area is published in the official gazette except as
provided under proviso to Section 43 of the Act. Section 46 of the MRTP Act provides that the
Planning Authority in considering the application for permission for development shall have due
regard to the provisions of any draft or final plan or proposals published by means of notice
submitted or sanctioned under the MRTP Act. Section 59 of the MRTP Act provides for preparation
of the Scheme under the MRTP Act, which specifically provides that the Planning Authority may
prepare one or more Town Planning Scheme for the area within its jurisdiction or any part thereof
for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the Final Development Plan. As such, we not
concerned with Section 59 of the MRTP Act, as in the present case, the Scheme which provides 15
metres internal road was prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of the NIT Act and prior to
the enactment of MRTP Act and, therefore, Section 39 read with Section 92 shall be applicable.

11.9 Therefore, on conjoint reading of Sections 39, 43, 46 and even Section 59 of the MRTP Act, the
Development Plans prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act shall prevail.

Therefore, there cannot be any development and/or construction permitted contrary to the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 13Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

Development Plan prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act, though the
Scheme prepared and sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act may permit such development
and/or construction. As such, the aforesaid view which we are taking is supported by the decision of
this Court in the case of Manohar Joshi (supra). In the case of Manohar Joshi (supra), after
considering the relevant provisions of the MRTP Act as well as the NIT Act, this Court has
specifically observed and held that when there is a conflict between the Development Plan prepared
and sanctioned under the provisions of MRTP Act and the Scheme sanctioned under the provisions
of the NIT Act, the DP shall override the TP Scheme. It is also further observed that even if the
variation, as directed under Section 39 of the MRTP Act does not take place, the land cannot be put
to use, in any way, in contradiction with the provisions of DP Plan. In the case of Manohar Joshi
(supra) this Court confirmed the findings recorded by the High Court that the DP Plan overrides the
TP Scheme. This Court did not accept the submission that the Development Plan and the TP Scheme
operate independent of each other and, until the State Government exercise its power of eminent
domain under the Development Plan, and acquires the land, the land owners can develop its
property as per the user permitted under the TP Scheme. While not accepting the above submission,
it is observed by this Court that permitting a development contrary to the provisions of the
Development Plan, knowing fully well that the user under the TP Scheme is at variance in the
Development Plan will make provisions of Sections 39, 42, 46 and 52 of the MRTP Act meaningless.
Therefore, the contrary observation and finding recorded by the High Court that unless and until the
Scheme is varied under Section 46 of the NIT Act as required under provisions of Section 39 of the
MRTP Act, the Scheme sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act shall subsist and can be
enforced, cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.

11.10 It is required to be noted that though in the Scheme sanctioned under the provisions of the
NIT Act proposing 15 metres internal road was in operation since 23.01.1964, when the MRTP Act
came into force and even thereafter when the First Development Plan was sanctioned under Section
31 of the MRTP Act for Nagpur in the year 1976 in which there was no proposal for 15 metres
internal road, and even thereafter, twice the Development Plan was revised first in the year 1989
and again in the year 2001 in which also there was no provision for the 15 metres internal road,
despite the above, at no point of time, anybody including the original writ petitioners challenged the
Development Plan under the MRTP Act in which the 15 metres internal road was not shown. Even
thereafter also, at no point of time, and even in the writ petition, the original writ petitioners
challenged and prayed to set aside the Development Plan in which there was no provision for 15
metres internal road, though the same was mentioned in the Scheme prepared and sanctioned
under Section 45 of the NIT Act.

11.11 It is also required to be noted that even the land owners/developers have got the layout plan
sanctioned and obtained the building permission under the provisions of the MRTP Act.
Considering the object and purpose of the MRTP Act noted hereinabove, it appears that though
there was a provision for internal 15 metres road in the Scheme under the NIT Act which was
sanctioned in the year 1964, thereafter much development had taken place and there are changed
circumstances. In the Development Plan/revised Development Plan the existing road came to be
widened from 12 metres to 24 metres and, therefore, when the DP was prepared and sanctioned
under the MRTP Act, there was no proposal for 15 metres internal wide road. As discussed

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 14Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

hereinabove, the Development Plan prepared and sanctioned under the MRTP Act would override
the TP Scheme. As observed hereinabove, there cannot be any development and/or construction
permitted contrary to the DP Plan under the MRTP Act. Under the circumstances, the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court cannot be sustained.

11.12 A faint attempt was made on behalf of the original writ petitioners that, in the DP Plan, there
was punctuated line which can be said to be 15 metres internal road from Abhyankar Road.
However, on considering the part plan of sanctioned Development Plan of Nagpur City sanctioned
by Notification dated 10.09.2001 (upon which the reliance has been placed by the original writ
petitioners), the aforesaid cannot be accepted. As rightly contended on behalf of the NIT, the
punctuated lines are described as Mouza Boundary/NIT Scheme Boundary. It is to be noted that
even the High Court noted that there is a conflict between the DP Plan and the Scheme sanctioned
under Section 45 of the NIT Act.

11.13 Even the findings recorded by the High Court that the action of the NIT in sanctioning the
layout plan and granting building permit is mischief of law, cannot be accepted. The layout plans are
sanctioned and the building permit has been granted absolutely in consonance with the DP
sanctioned under the MRTP Act. The demolition notices were received pursuant to and in
furtherance of the building permit and so as to enable the original land owners/developers to put up
the construction as per the layout plan sanctioned and the building permit granted. Therefore, the
High Court has erred in holding that the action of the NIT was mischief in law.

11.14 It is required to be noted that, on one hand, the High Court has specifically observed in
paragraph 86 that the High Court has not set aside and it is also not necessary for the High Court to
set aside the layout plan and the building permit granted by the NIT, the observations made by the
High Court in paragraph 89(2) would tantamount to virtually quashing and setting aside the
sanctioned layout plan in the building permit. The sum and substance and the resultant effect of the
observations made by the High Court in paragraph 89(2), the observation made by the High Court
in earlier part of the judgment virtually restrains the original land owners/developers not to put up
any construction on the building layout plan and the building permit granted under the MRTP Act.
Therefore, it appears that though not specifically quashing and setting aside the sanctioned layout
plan and the building permit granted under the MRTP Act, the High Court has nullified the
sanctioned layout plan and the building permit granted under the MRTP Act. 11.15 It is also required
to be noted that the dispute is pending since many years. The land owners/developers entered into
compromise with other similarly situated tenants. Now, only 18 tenants are opposing the
development, though the land owners/developers have agreed and are ready and willing to give
similar treatment to them also which would be given to other tenants as agreed before this Court. It
appears that for some reasons and/or to pressurize the land owners/ developers to give them some
more benefits, the original writ petitioners are opposing the development/construction. Though the
original land owners/developers are having the building permission and have got their plans
sanctioned under the provisions of MRTP Act and even after incurring huge expenses, they are not
in a position to put up any further construction because of the pending litigation. Therefore, the
equity would also be in favour of the appellants as land owners/developers. As, at this stage, it is
required to be noted that even those tenants with whom the original land owners/developers have

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 15Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019

entered into a compromise before this Court have appeared through the Advocate and have stated
that they are out of possession since last more than ten years and therefore, they all have requested
to quash and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court and permit the
land owners/developers to complete the construction. 11.16 Insofar as the submission made by the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners that after the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court, the NIT has modified the Scheme as permitted by the
High Court and, therefore, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is acted
upon and, therefore, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court may not be
permitted to be challenged by the NIT and/or the developer is concerned, the same has no
substance. Merely because to avoid any further legal complication, if the NIT has modified the
Scheme that would not preclude the NIT and/or the original land owners/developers to challenge
the impugned judgment and order.

11.17 In view of the above submissions and for the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court deserves to be quashed and set aside.

TRANSFERRED CASE © No.23/2018:

12. Now, so far as the Transferred Case © No.23/2018 is concerned, the Writ Petition filed by the
original writ petitioners being Writ Petition No.5005 of 2017 has been transferred to this Court
pursuant to the order passed by this Court dated 03.11.2017. In the petition, the original writ
petitioner have prayed to quash and set aside the Notification dated 21.04.2017 issued by the NIT
and the NIT Resolution No.27/1167 dated 07.03.2017 and Resolution No.17/1165 dated 03.01.2017
by which the original Scheme of 1964 sanctioned under Section 45 of the NIT Act has been modified
in exercise of power under Section 45 of the NIT Act and the 15 metres internal road has been
deleted.

12.1 It is vehemently submitted on behalf of the original writ petitioners that the Notification
modifying the Scheme and deleting 15 metres internal road is without following any procedure as
required under the Act and without inviting any objections and even the approval of the State
Government has not been obtained. However, considering the contents of the counter affidavit filed
on behalf of the NIT in which it is specifically stated that after considering the objections sent by the
15 writ petitioners in Petition No.2017, the Authority unanimously passed a Board Resolution in
exercise of power under Section 46 of the Act. Therefore, it cannot be said that no opportunity at all
was given to the petitioners. The decision to modify the Scheme by deleting 15 metres internal road
has been taken after considering the objections raised by the writ petitioners. It is required to be
noted that Section 39 of the MRTP Act mandates the Planning Authority to vary the Scheme in line
with the Development Plan sanctioned under the MRTP Act. It is required to be noted that when the
DP was sanctioned, without any proposal for the 15 metres internal road, first in the year 1976 and
thereafter in the years 1989 and 2001, the same was after following the due procedure and the same
was approved and sanctioned by the State Government. Therefore, thereafter, when the Scheme to
the extent in conflict with the DP Plan has been modified as mandated under Section 39 of the
MRTP Act, after considering the objections raised by the original writ petitioners, thereafter, the
same cannot be said to be illegal. Therefore, reading Section 39 of the MRTP Act and the provisions

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144903858/ 16Nagpur Improvement Trust vs M/S. Bombaywala . on 22 January, 2019
of the NIT Act harmoniously, the impugned Notification modifying the Scheme and/or Board
Resolution modifying the Scheme deleting 15 metres wide road, which would now be in line with the
Development Plan sanctioned under the MRTP Act, the same cannot be said to be illegal warranting
interference of this Court. Therefore, challenge to the Notification dated 21.04.2017 issued by the
NIT and the respective NIT Resolution modifying the Scheme deleting 15 metres internal road fails.

13. In view of the above and for the further reasons stated above, all the respective Civil Appeals are
hereby allowed and the impugned judgment and order dated 15.09.2016 passed by the High Court
of Bombay, Bench of Nagpur passed in Writ Petition No.2695 of 2015 is hereby quashed and set
aside.

13.1 The Transferred Case © No.23/2018 stands dismissed for the reasons stated hereinabove.
However, it is observed that to the respective original writ petitioners shall also be given the same
treatment as would be available/given to other tenants as agreed before this Court and/or as per the

settlement entered into with other tenants.

14. All these appeals are allowed accordingly with the above observations and the Transferred Case
stands dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
